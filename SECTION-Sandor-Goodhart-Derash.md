is the third level of interpretative understanding. The word "midrash" derives from it, as numerous commentators point out, adding on the preposition mi- to the word derash. It refers to inquiry, an inquiring into or, conversely, a drawing out of or extracting from text that is perhaps somewhat obscure. institutes a comparison or outlines implications so that a so to speak, may be more effectively understood, mul knowledge about il may be acquired. Fishbane notes that also refers to the formal, compositional, stylistic casts in which a text works, for example, its tropological structure.32 Since it sometimes involves narrative or aggadic materials, as opposed to halachic materials that specify the code in which some words are to be understood, it is sometimes designated as "aggadic midrash." It is also sometimes identified with the homiletic, with the moral and/or ethical obligations imposed upon us as a result of a text, the ways in which the story relates to the real lives we lead. In contrast to (which is always to some extent hidden), takes place on the surface (like rather than within a context and expresses the function of a meaningful sentence outside the expected context, in relation to a moral agent perhaps, or in relation to an evident rhetorical structure. answers the questions: To what may this meaningful statement be compared? What are its implications, morally or ethically, for me personally or for us as a group? What need I do as a result of it? How shall I understand its implications from a comparable context or for us as a group?

Mi n is yet one more way of characterizing these terms. Peshat is said to be the most available dimension or level of the text, what is there on its surface, so to speak, its embodiment. 33 Heme.·, by contrast, concerns the allusions a text makes, its hints, its intertextuality with other texts (their traces in this n s i, concealed from first glance, and yet necessary if meaning is to be engendered). Then derash comes along. Like peshat, derash is available on the surface. Derash involves the individual moral or ethical obligations a text imposes, but again, only η isolai as those obligations exist on the surface of things and are overtly demonstrable. Derash explains the means by which the text says what it says given its internal tropological struc- I me, as opposed to its typological structure, which is a feature of usine.·. And sod introduces the deeper intrinsic meanings of the UM, those hidden from view, unlike derash, but deriving from ·.omccs even more unavailable than other texts, sources within Ilie individual soul or even within the divine. Sod introduces t line. Sod describes what will have been, liremez is hidden from view because it is a code, sod is hidden from view because it has not hilly occurred as yet. The messianic is a soddic modality.
