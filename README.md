# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Overview

## Thesis statement

**Anarchism of the Other Person** will be a rethinking of anarchism through the ethics of Emmanuel Levinas. Its goals will be twofold: (1) to extend the ethical genealogy of anarchism by reading it through Levinas; (2) to demonstrate readings of Levinas as an anarchist.

## Discursive context

Given that anarchism is continuously being reborn unto a multiplicity of genealogies, it is useful to identify that this investigation considers itself to be in the lineage of ethical anarchocommunism, drawing deeply from ancestors such as Petr Kropotkin, whose pamphlets inspired Russian revolutionaries to overthrow Czar Nicolas II, and Ricardo Flores Magon, whose journalism inspired Mexican revolutionaries to overthrow dictator Porfirio Diaz. However, even the perspectives of these two teachers will be further perverted, inverted, subverted, and reverted as we dive as well into the streams of writers such as bell hooks, Lucy Parsons, Lynne Farrow, William C. Anderson, Sam Mbah, Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, Kim Tall Bear, Aragorn!, ZigZag, Klee Benally, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Loree Erickson, and Sunsara Taylor.

## Levinas / Nietzsche 

   1. Thesis
      1. The task of developing such an ethical anarchism of the other person seems especially important for the way that it requires us to consider the relationship between the voluntary and the obligatory. 

   2. Perspectivism
      1. obligation against voluntarism, 
      2. Nietzsche: the perspective of the will 
      3. Levinas: perspectives of other persons, familiar and unfamiliar
   
   3.  The Will, Scopenhauer and Buddhism
       1. Schopenhauer's conception of the Will: World as Will and Representation.  
       2. What is the Will for Schopenhauer?

   4.  What is Representation
         1.  How does the idea of representation relate to Kant?
         2.  "View from nowhere" of dispassionate spectator 
         3.  Cartesianism cogito as subject that grounds experience?
         4.  How does the perspective of the Will threaten it?

   6.  Nietsche and Anarchism
       1.  Nietzsche's critique of moralism has been broadly influential along the history of anarchism
       2. through his own writings
       3. in union with precursors such as Max Stirner, 
       4. and in heirs such as Martin Heidegger and Gilles Deleuze 
       5. in foundational anarchocommunist thinkers such as 
           1. Emma Goldman and Ricardo Flores Magon (Nietzsche) 
           2. and contemporary ones such as John Zerzan (Heidegger)  
           3.  Hakim Bey -- Ontological Anarchism (Deleuze)

   5.  Ontological Anarchism  
       1.  Why is this even a thing?
       2.  Ontology in Deleuze and Heidegger 
       3.  Univocity of being. -- Duns Scotus  
       4.  Spinoza
   
   6. Iconoclasm, Heresy 
       1. Anarchism as smashing idols (Abolitionism?)
       2.  Both Nietzsche and Levinas are useful for smashing the idols of domination, 
       3.  with Levinas weilding Niezsche's hammer like a Macabee.
   
   7. Heraclitus (Polemos)
       1. However, the thinking of Nietzsche and his inheritors derive ultimately , who argued that struggle (_polemos_) was the root of all things. 
       2.  Being itself is understood as a contest of wills -- 
       3. metaphysical, 
       4. Nietzsche's version of Schopenhauer's version of Buddhism 
       5. from the atomic level of mechanistic thinking 
       6. to the species level of "survival of the fittest" 
       7. to a political level saturated with domination by hegemonic powers and micropowers.

   9.  Buddhism
        1.  Will 
            1. Schopenhauer's conception of the world as will is somehow derived from his conception of Buddhism 
            2.  Maya / Nothingness.  What is his conception of Buddhism? 
         2.  Heraclitus lacks Buddhist wisdom (prajna) and ethics (sila)
             1. Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu claims that, “The Buddha mentioned that there was a religious teacher at that time named Araka who taught about impermanence as much as the Buddha did, but went no further and said nothing about dukkham (suffering) and anattā (non##selfhood). . . . The Blessed One probably meant Heraclitus
             2. Soteriological function of wisdom.  
                 1. A transformational knowledge.  
                 2. not just knowing-about
                 3. Salvific, Liberatory
         3. Dukkha
            1. Prajna (wisdom) has a liberatory aspect. 
            2. Knowledge of suffering means knowledge of the four noble truths of Buddhism
            3. [1] All existence is suffering 
            4. [4] there is also a path that leads from suffering.
         4. __Anatman__
            1. __Atman__ in Yogacara, Upanishads, Bhavadgita
                1. __Atman__ = __Brahman__. 
                2. My self is the world self. 
                3. New Age yoga types try to interpret this benevolently as the deep spiritual interconnection of all Being
                4. This is the foundation of a lot of twisted fascist garbage. 
                5. It is the fantasy of authority. 
                6.  Foundation of the caste system too. 
                7. Foundation of Guru culture. 
                8. Yoga culture is spiritual essence of neoliberal capitalism.  
                9. "self-realization" is dumb.  no wonder they all go qanon.
                10.  This is not corruption by Western culture, etc. It's already in the texts
                10.  Hinduvata in India is horrible.
            2.  Nihilism version is the same thing 
                1.  The negative version, affirming the nothingness instead of the fullness is the same thing
                2.  This is also fascist garbage
                3.  Isis, Tiqqun, maybe talk about anarchist nihilism.  
                4.  Write about Aragorn! anarchist nihilism
                5.  Does this start with Schopenhauer?
            
            3. Anatman in Buddhism
                1. Buddhism as a protest against the culture of atman
                2.  Maybe bring in something about __Shakyamuni__ being a prince and refusing his authority
                3.  non-selfhood (__annata__) is foundational  
            4.  __Nagarjuna__ / __Madhayamika__ 
                1.  __Nagarjuna__'s __karikas__.
                2.  Uses a __quatralemma__ to undermine the idea of __svabhva__ (self-identity) with that of __sunnata__ (emptiness)
       5. Boddhisatva Anarchism
           1. Not merely to liberate oneself but to become a Boddhisatva dedicated to liberating others from suffering, and to declare:
           2. "Sentient beings are numberless, I vow to save them."







       6.  Heraclitus / Levinas 
             1. Levinas has a theory of __becoming__: under the guise of "otherwise than being"  (masks/Neitzsche:  Levinas's characters.  Who is this sentence pretending to be?)
             2. articulated in his later work in the language of structuralism as "synchrony/diachrony" 
             3.  Snapshot vs. change over time
             4. Levinas describes the dynamic pulsation of the moment
             5.  “a becoming . . . radically opposed to the idea of being . . . the resistance to every integration expressed by the image of the river in which, according to Heraclitus one does not bathe twice, and according to Cratylus, not even once” (60)
             6. Domination of Becoming by Being is thwarted by the epiphany of the exterior other as well as the dynamic beyond being of the psyche’s interior becoming.
             7. That is, anarchism is compelled by our continuous ethical orientation to other persons (even the other person who I am to myself over time), not by a Heraclitean flux of interpenetrating forces.
        1. Levinas / Buddhism on Becoming 
            1. Nagarguna
               1. Patticasammupada.  Dependent co origination.  
               2. Arising and Falling of phenomenona 
               3. Nagarjuna as discriminating. 
               4. First acknowledges the Abhidhamma dialectic.
               5. Then he destroys then he destroys them.  
            2. Levinas:
                1. Diachrony / Synchrony
                2. Time as continuous creation
                3. I is an other
                4. Rupture of present by the future (Totality and Infinity).  
                5. Rupture already in the present (Otherwise than Being)
                4. The question of self-identity through time.
            3. Being of Becoming
                1. The question of the Being of Becoming 
                2. how do moments flow from one to the other? 
                3. Is there an eternal substance beneath all everything and things that change are merely accidents of this time, a fourth dimenstional spacetime continuum a fourth dimensional prism? 
                4. Is time like Becoming, like a river in Heraclitus. 
                5. Levinas has a lot of strange discussions about river / water .  What do those metaphors mean?  
                6. Our foundational ideas about Becoming of time. 
                7. Everything flows. Everything is in flux.
                8. Panta Rhei. 
                9. Levinas contrasts his idea of time from between the Cratylus and the Heraclitus, where one can not even place ones foot in the same river once?
            3. Locke: self-persistence
                1. In Locke's Essays. persistence of self through time.  
                2. Locke influential in France?
                3. Fundamental questions of temporality: 
                4. in what way am I the same person over time?
                5. In what way does time connect unto itself
                6. Locke quotation from the essays 
                7. let's hope i still have the paper from Double Nickles' class.
                8. Time consciousnes and how the each moment leads into the other.
            5. Presence of the present
               1. Illusory present? (Schopenhauer: __Maya__)
               2. Urgent present? (Heidegger: Authentic commitment of heritage towards the future in the moement of vision)  
       8. "Curvature" of space
          1. Space is disruptive of Time
          2. Heidegger
              1. For Heidegger, dynamic of power is more authentic than the mathematical analytic of Kantianism, the spatialization of Descartes.  
              3.  Heidegger temporalizes space to counter mathematical kantian jewish reduction to mathematical static analysis
          3. Spatial dimenstional Orientation  
             1. orientation towards the other person.  
             2. situatedness.
             3. Andrea Cavalli
             4. Ethics is an optics.
          4. Quotation  
             1. The differences between the Other and me ... are due to the I-Other conjuncture, to the inevitable orientation of being ‘starting from oneself ’ towards ‘the Other.’ The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work.  (TI 215)
       9. Time and the Other 
          1. What is it for Levinas htat is so disruptive of time and time consciousness, of our self identity , of existence itself that is so disruptive to temporality of becoming is our relationships with other people.
       10. Totality and Infinity
            1. Quote  
               1. Throughout Totality and Infinity, Levinas explicitly declares the perspectival nature of his philosophy. He remarks in the preface “ethics is an optics”71 and later elaborates, "The differences between the Other and me ... are due to the I-Other conjuncture, to the inevitable orientation of being ‘starting from oneself ’ towards ‘the Other.’ The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work."72  The ethical relationship begins from the separated stance of the subject, oriented by its body73, looking at something that is a someone who distorts that vision.  From my perspective of interiority, the other person’s stance appears as an exteriority. Levinas explains this distortion by using the metaphor of a “curvature of intersubjective space” 74 that deforms the synoptic viewpoint. He attributes this curvature to the fact that the Other appears in a “dimension of height”75, yet the terminology of curvature implies another dimensional warping. Emerging out of 19th century research into non-Cartesian geometries and non-Euclidean spaces, the concept of curvature became famous in the 20th when Einstein employed the work of Bernard Riemann to explain how gravity bends light.76 According to his theory of general relativity, it is the massiveness of matter leaving a weighty imprint within the fabric of spacetime that produces this curvature.
                Hobbes
       11. Hobbes
           1. The ontology of Heraclitus, that grounds the Being of Becoming in struggle, provides grounding for writers such as Thomas Hobbes, who sees the struggle of all against all as the ground for the authoritarianism of the political. 
           2. Violence is primordial not just in the authoritarianism of the state but in the web of linkages that constitutes the social, that reduces humanity as the vehicle for the drives that move us, 
           3. Being as the dynamic collision of mechanical particles. 
           4. Desires that express themselves through us. 
           5. Voluntarism of Hobbes is not the individual subject but the will flowing through it.
           6. Fear of death drives the will
       12. Digestion vs Birth
           1. Becoming of Being as metabolism 
              1.  The mechanistic theory of Hobbes, who sees things as merely colliding with each other and driven by anonymous desires and other mechanical forces that flow through us
           2. Becoming of Being as birthing
              1. Levinas, Kropotkin, and Sarah Hrdy can give us an understanding of the Becoming of Being not only in terms of metabolism but also as birthing, as the generation of generations, a continuous creation.
        

10. Ethics 
    1. What is ethics? What is the study of ethics?
       1. I don't know this. Learn this language!
       2. Normative? Perscriptive? Descriptive? Deontological? utiltarian?
       3. What we do, how we behave.
       4. Aristotle and virtue ethics.
    2. Anarchism and Ethics
       1. Anarchism has always been self-consciously ethical
       2. Godwin?
       3. Read Kropotkin's Ethics.
       4. Graeber?
       5. Let's hope Graeber or someone else defines the idea of ethics
    3. Ethics and the will
       1. One of the central question of the moral philosophy is that of the will
       2. Ethos, habitus, what you do and how you behave, what you practice
       3. how do you control the will to do the correct thing, whatever that right goal is
    4. Nietzsche: will disproves moralism
       1. Everyone's actios is ultimately driven by a will to power.
       2. Nietzsche distinguies two modes in which the will to power is expressed
          1. Good and bad:
             1. Ethics of the strong is in alignment with their will to power.
             2. They practice a Stoical virtue ethics of strength and enjoy things that make them stronger and respect strength in others.
             3. Grounded in narcissism.  Strength recognizes other for his similiarity, his strength.
             4. Recognition of the power of the other nobles and respect for the strenght in the other
             5. Contempt or blissful ignorance of the weakness of the weak
          4. Good and evil.
             1. THe Moralism of the weak is an expression of the will to power from the perspective of ressentiment.
             2. It is a power that detests the expression of the strong and powerful.
             3. It is contradictory. A will to power that hates the power of the powerful
       5. Deleuze 
          1. interprets this as "active" versus "reactive"
          2. Interprets WTP as machinic desires
          3. Anti subjectivity
             1. Will to power disrupts the subject
             2. Properly speaking, the will to power is not even my own will per se
             3. It is something that is moving through me.
             4. Drives that are driving us. Desires that are pushing us. The will to power is not even my own wlll but instead is something moving through me.
             5. The idea of the "self" is a epiphenomenal. The idea of the subject is an illusion created by the forces that flow through us, giving the illusion of som internal consistency of a subtance that subtends those various
             6. This is very much at the root of antihumanism and the turn against subjectivity from Deleuze and Foucault (subject is produced by powers/desires)
        4. Levinas on the will
            1. The Will in Levinas
            2. I have written about this ages ago
            3. The will is not heroic.
            4. Whatever I will is taken over by others
            5. The beginning of the act is not the same as the end
            6. Is this something or other final cause Aristotle?
            7. Being-towards-the-end is never my end but always restarted by the other person -- even myself as an other person within my existence as temporal being.
            8.  Will is related to the end as murder and theft, works and wastes, liabble to be assumed by others
            Unless, that is, the naivety of the philosopher not call, beyond the reflection on oneself, for the critique exer-
cised by another philosopher ... empirically it is realized as the history of philosophy in which new inter-
locutors always enter who have to restate, but in which the former ones take up the floor to answer in the
interpretations they arouse. (Levinas, Otherwise..., op. cit., p. 20).

11. Levinas's ethics
    1.  Background
        1. Dialogue with philsophical dialogues spanning the history of thinkers throughout time and space
           1. Relation to past inheritance of thought.
           2. Often a parody or a mutation of their terminology.  __il y a__ for __es gibt__, etc. 
           3. Community of Philosophers OTB. 

        1. Presocratics / Plato
           1. Not sure what to say here.  
           2. Plato -- something really obscure.  
           3. Plotinus, I think.  "parracide"
           4. Find out what weirdo metaphysical Platonic dialogue Levinas refers to "plato distinguised a genus outside of Being.  
        2. Descartes/Kant
            1. Problematic of the subject
            2. Things are referred back to subjective POV or absolute POV (transcendental consciousness)
            3. Problem of self-identity over time
        2. Hegel
            1. "Totality and Infinity".  
               1. Totality is clearly a reference to Hegel.
               2. Levinas is in constant dialogue

               3. Counterposes the "infinity" of the other person with the "totality" of systematic thinking 
               4.  But the conjunction is "and", 
               5. Not "against". This already suggests both touching and mutual support and as well as conflict.  Already in relation
               6.  Anyways it isn't a polemical struggle.  We are talking "And" here, people.
               7. As Derrida points out "Levinas is very close to Hegel when he claims to be very far away from him".  
               8. "Strategy of Opposition" doesn't work with GWFH.  Grows from opposition.
        1. Rethinking dualism -- amphibology of being                 
               1.  Like Hegel, Levinas has a complex idea of the relations between polarity.
               2. Grab this stuff from my paper
               3. The motion of the dialectic is what is problematic.  The moment is absorbed and destroyed and negated and sustained (Aufheben)
               4. The two poles strive towards mutual destruction.  
               5. Hobbesian struggle unto death.
               6. Twofold problem: nature of opposition and nature of resolution
               7. Levinas has an "amphibology of being.  Take quotes form old papers on this.
        2. Conceives as analytically divisible moments
            1. technique is very similar
            2. Decomposing a singular event into the moments that compose it. 
            3. Narrative of TI is the generatoin of generations
            4. Each moment is described as afamilial role.  Hebrew patriarchal family. 
        3. Husserl  -- phenomenology
            1. Roots in phenomenology
            2.  The way that our everyday lives are constituted in and through to the other in our every orientation and every action
            3.  From Husserl the understanding of the world as relating back to the subject's perception of the world.
            4.  Question of how we relate to the world and to other persons from our station in consciousness
        7.  Ontology
            1.  Not just a matter of our separate station of being a subject but that our existence as individuals is an aspect of the way that Being itself is expressed.
            2.  Space: Human being is the place where being is expressed. THe "Da" of being. The place wehre being occurs
            3.  Time: Temporality is essential for understanding the way that being is expressed within the space of human existing.
            4.  One is not a passive member of the passive present. Instead, within the moment (augenblick) takes on the heritage that one has inherited from the past and projects it towards the future. The future is what pushes forward the dynamic. Realizing the inevitablity of one's death, the possiblity of one's impossibility, one recognizes the possiblities that exists areound oneself.
    1.  In Being and Time, Heidegger advocates that one should "authentic" make things my own but takes on the heritage of the past as one's own (eigenlichtkeit) and understanding how the people are bound together that the existence of human being is fundamental to our being, that our existence is bound together
        with being at large.
        later writings focus on how being itself is the site of ereigenis, the place where mine-making occurs



It is this "curvature of spacetime", the perspective in which one is related to other people, that is what Levinas means by ethics.

Ethics is a phenomenological and ontological term for Levinas

## Anarchy

What then does this have to do with anarchy?

That things have no stable foundation. That nothig is permanent or abiding or absolute. The Absolute state is a sham as is the Absolute Deity. Domination comes from this belief in absolutes.

To solve this problem of the abosoluteness of everything anarchists ahve recommended an approach instead of ontological anarchy. Realizign that everything is in flux and always changing. Max Cafard says. pull a quote here.

But is this the only way that things break up? That they are always subject to chaos? And if so it is chaos? What is the disrupting element, the swerve (clinamen) that affects the movement of particules to give time a sense of randomness? The warping of gravity is that which is affected by the other.

The modes of our world that in which we exist, that form the intermediary realm in and through which we wander, are shaped and warped and contorted and subverted, perverted, inverted, and reverted perspectives by the gravity of the other person within the spacetime continuum The discontinuity of one's own existence as the "I is an other" of Rimbaud always transforming. But also the structure of time, in that we inherit a whole bunch of stuff from other people through time. And also the structure of society, that at any tiem we relate to other people we ultimatley are in static set of social relations.

Social relations are an important thing for Marxism and HEegeliansm . But how is Leivnas different? These social relation in many readings of Marx and Hegel would take theis to form what levinas calls a totality, a whole picture in which everything that can be captured by a snapshot that can be mapped out as a set of inner relations of the parts that constitute the whole. For Levinas a continual refusal to attempt that type of summary and encapsulation, to catpure the entrelyt in a lateral view. The other person comes at you in a certain orientation a veriety one is always standing in relation to others. For this reason the always disrupts this ttality . The total picture is just a snapshot that obscures the dynamic within the picture itself. THat these things are always broken apart and in fact never were a single thing to begin with.

In this way, Levinas carries on with an idea that is in Hegel of separating moments of time into constitutents. A descriptive phenomonlogy of each moment of time. That each is disrupted by the other even before it can acheive self existence and that illustrating the inner structure of this relationship to singularity of the other person, the fact that the other person is an irreplaceableity of an individual and not merely an example of a certain type of person, and that within this dimesnion of our relationship with individuals is already the relatiosnhip with other persons #### that you have a smile on your face when i see you in the morning because the bodega clerk made coffee this morning.

That our everyday existence is already informed by our relationships with other persons is fundamentatl to understanding the fundamentally anarchistic mode of our everyday existence. that we are already responsible to the other person and that the other person can surprise us with an unanticipated response. We never have everything at our control. At best we are projecting or inspecting or we ahve a certain snapshot, a certain idea of a person but that person inhabits it with their own particular gravity. That person is a woman but she occupies that place of her womanhood in her own particular manner #### she dresses in her own particular way, different levels of emotional and mental and spirtiual engagement, relationship with her own bodilty capablities like that of becoming a mother and so on. And beyond this they are a past that we can never fully know and a future that surprises us. that even if we can predict the ultimate outcome in a perfect skinner box of determinism, that the way that the other person reaches that terminus, the path is unpredictable to us.

our reading is `pataphysical, heretical, etc. use translation of heretics from federici
The problem of the pataphysical. The study of exceptions. In that every person throught erheir exisence is already an exception to the general rule, a new data point that must be incorporated to make the metric. Every other is an excpetion too

not "interconnected" by the intermediary sphere. we are connected through by linksages and within a globe. how do we analysie those? What is a medium? Medium is separation how are we linked and separated. It is this which is analszble. But we are nodes aupon this and looked more closely everything is a node

We are therfore resopnsible. In the sense that we are always responding to a relationship to other persons. Even our relationshpi to ourself is with another perosn. We are always in a reaction. the possiblity of our awareness is the possiblity of being affected by another person, in a way a passivility that already infomrs our every move. We are pulled by this gravity of the other person, it inclines us towards it, Like the Einstein used the example of gravity warping spacetime: place a ball in the middle of a sheet and the fabric around the ball bends in its direction. We are alrady inclined in their direction and in this sense already obligated towards them.

This obligation is not a domination but a freedom. The characteristic view of authoritarian thought is that other people threaten our own existenc. That what informs our relatinships with other people are along the axis of power #### or of Desire, which Baudrillard points out is a synonym for power (Baudrillard). Or that Hannah Arendt figues that is our relationship with the body. That it is a domantion of our freedom. That we must escapte th yoke of others to realizce our freedom. Sartre Hell is Other People that would find the existence of each of the three persons of Huis Clos the implinging of one on the other.

But maybe instead the obligations towards other people are our sources of freedom as well. They are what allow us to do anything really. Why get up but to see a freind to have a chat, to watch a tv show with people in it, to eat oatmeal that other people have farmed that other people have grown that other people have boxed that other people. Even if one were to declare oneself a hermit and to go into nature by oneself, one has no pathway to nature but through other people, even if only physically by following their maps and their roads.

## Economy and Ecology

Levinas approaches Becoming in a weird way. He starts from Hebrew scripture as the mythopoetic that is perhaps problematic as many feminist scholars have objected. Problematic from Foucault and Canguielm as the core motivating thing that is driving the entire discussion. However, this is not only problematic for Levinas, but it is his problematic. As Derrida says "perhaps the question s that we are asking levinas are the ones he is asking to us"

This quesitoning will take the form of raising the mythopoesis of the Hebraic scripture, a history of patriarchs and matriarchs.

Being and becoming occurs not as a flux of anonymous forces, of panta rhei, of all things arising from polemos, the conflict of opposites. But instead as the generation of gendered generations, of relationships constituted as relatives, of kinspersons and foreigners.

Thus Levinas explores through a series of analytic structures that have been questioned: family members (mothers, fathers, daughters, orphans, widows, sisters, an infertile woman #### this is the witches in macbeth, son of life), as well as a deeply ambiguous employment of gender binaries.

Problematic gender binaries maybe. Talk about sociobiology to get a better understanding of what it might mean for how gender relationships have informed the generation of generations throughout evolutionary history and within primates, within the development of human socieities

### The feminine

Levinas defines the rlationship that one has with the other as "welcoming" . A few pages before he explains that the woman's role is the welcoming.

### Home

Oikos for Levinas is the thing that is important here.
Homeplace from bell hooks that illustrates the importance of home in situatign oneself in a way that fees safe and comforatble within oneself. Levinas talks about the "home" that is made.

Aristotle understands the home as a site of domination.

What is a home though? A home is a place where one meets one's needs

Hannah Arendt understand needs as fundamentatl to domination.

But alongside this idea of "meal tub fellows". This is the root of our word "companion", that "we work, we eat together" of the Diggers.

How do we address our needs together in a way that is respectful to all. What are needs
Kropotkin #### that we can meet our needs in the first place is the remarkable thing and that shows our fundamental indebtedness to one another. A debt that leads to our obligation to one another. THat we are bound together in solidarity.

Solidarity is thus not just a thing that we should strive for but something that already exists. We are already bound to other people. We just need to recognize this indebtedness and to make it manifest. Here I say "indebtedness" rathat than "interconnectedness" because of lateral view. Not something that can be overlayed with by a graph and that we can calculate the most efficiet way to do it. Well actually no it is. Logistics is the way we do it. But also we expereince it as a personal realtionship. Not just that "debt exists in the marketplace" but that I myself am in debt to somebody else and need to pay

the mode that Levinas investigates this is through an understanding of a metabolism of Being. A process of consumption and production. This meetabolism of being is understood through the process of maturation as that which establishes the upwards growth of the subject. THe narrative of Totatlityh and Infinity describes the is that of the generation of gendered generations, a process taken from Descartes of the idea of continous creation as well as in the bible. Not a static uniliear time with uniform density flat surface but rather a varying inflected and bent surface which is punctuated by moments of gravity, each of which has a different start and an end, the moments are separated and distinct from each other, but perhaps only retrospectively. There is a certain pattern to the movement of life, similar to what Levinas refers to as the diastole and the systole of the heart. Each moment begins as a birth in a moment matures from childhood to married working adulthood and is death and then reborn. So let's try instead to argue this from the perspective of the Jewish patriarchy and that it is in many ways using biblical motifs or at least that it inheriets throughtout from a variety of inlets such as Hebraic scripture as well as the tradional Greek philosophy. So we can understand the as the first book of the bible genesis, the story of generation of generations.

Within this process of maturation, Levinas identifies two moments of consumption. The world emerges as a baby embedded in what he calls a milieu, where the world is already as if they are their own, in which the

Within the narrative of Totality and Infinity, Levinas describes the life phases of the individual as they progress from birth to maturation

Metabolism: Eating and shitting

Meatabolism of Levinas understood as two step process. In Totality and Infinity, Levinas First is eating. Then is working. The eating as nursing, as mother sucking its teats. The elemental maternal other. Here describe the other as elemental. Then also quote there "capable of killing for a crust of bread" Possession of murder. In Otherwise than Being, he expands this analysis to the idea of breathing

"we make it out of waste and works"

Work and Death

Capable of killing for a crust of bread. Here we find "killing" in the working. What establises property is what exerts ones power over the other, of rendering exeriority into something that can be grasped. By doing so, you repress the otherness of the other. You run it into something that can be manipulated and controlled and dominated. This is in a way killing it. Here killing does not just mean to actually kill someone but rather to appropriate something as one's own. The suspension of their possiblity of being. Oh I know that person as x or y, to submit them as a general concept.

The idea of capabity of the statement I can. I can expert an effort, an interrogation of powre and potency, and of will for defining onesel. The deepest interaction with Nk
Dead capital as found my David McNally, vampire of the market is the thing that is the capital, sucking the life force of the worker. So not just people but the world itself. In fact, what power does is to reify things, to make things, to turn a process into a self subsistent entity. Therefore for the grasping of the self, what the Buddhists call "grasping mind" it is the thing that stills phenomenon such that it can be grasped in a present moment, in a present time, at present place, in the fullness of presence. That is the moment. but it ignores the futuring and the past, the "arising and cessation" of phenomena. Here we can bring in Buddhism.

METABOLICS and GENESIS
What Levinas does that is interesting is that he overlays the conception of a metabolic process with an idea of genesis of gendered generations. The process of genesis. It is birth and role in a family. Understanding the kinship of being and of others. That we are connected to each other as family and as strangers. Orders of relation which Levinas breaks down as a series of relationships, understood as a geneaology of persons, of persons born unto each other

Geneaology not just a succession of accidental events. Well it is that. It is a pataphysicla thing. each thing comes as an unexpleced surprise and must be integrated a la pataphysics where each exception is made more general. born of evolutionary understanding of birth and rebirth. Where each exception occurs as a uniqe chosen one, that it is a unique perso. Same as a set of material relations. If things are all material relations, then aperson lurks behind that

A multitude of family relations #### paternity as a mode of self relation, fraternity as a metaphoric for political citizenship, participation within a public sphere as an equal among equals. But also maternity.

What can we say about maternity then?

MATERNITY
Maternity is important because of why. It underscores all of these types of relationships with each other. The primary understanding as one of need. Need rather than desire. But why? Is that what I want to say for levinas? Yes it is kind of. So the Need is something which has a terminus, which aims towards a goal. That is what happens in the present. Soemthing is fulfilled and filled up. A desire is a thing that is perpetual and unfulfilled. But Levinas says something very interesting then:
"The needs of the other are my own spirtual needs" Material vs spiritual. Recognizing of the cosubstantiality of the spirit of all people. Not so much as "recognizing" but as being inspired. the person around you already drives you in a certain direction. its not even a choice but a drive. Not merely the same thing as a person telling you "do this and do that" but already the fact that we are even participating in the world is already a precondition for us to do anything. that is to say that we do wahat we do because other pepole have already made the world possible for us. That someone made a coffee or shoes for us. That thought up clocks and keeping time. Et cetera. Even that we were born.

Also the web of life

An analysis therefore of what makes the life worth living aroud other people

SPECIES BEING
Here we have the idea of "species being"
What are the inherited ways that we have done with each other
WEll when we even start to look at what we have inhereited we must be mindful of the fact that what we only have a partial perspective on what is going on. We don't know everything. This is another example of the pataphysical as understood by Alfred Jarry. We only make our data based on accumulated evidence. We piece togehter the picutre

Ontogyny follows phylogyny. We can also understand the idea of the maternal through the work of Sarah ruddick and Eva Kittay. We can listen to indigenous and black people. Such as for example bell hooks We can then also turn to the work of Sarah Hrdy as outlining stuff from the domains of anthropology and evolutionalry biology.

## Motherhood

Sarah Ruddick and the thing about Sarah Ruddick is that she emphasizes that the maternal is a practice. Several key points about her

## Not a person but a practice

## Goal of practice is threefold

## It is a demand

## Type of evaluative morality that we have for it

## Every maternal theorist brings up ambiguity

## Bring in Sophie Lewis and also Sarah Lachance Adams

Eva Kittay

That the difference between phylogyny and genetics. Or what is it. She makes a distiction between nature and nurture. There is an admixture of the two in this concept. That there is an inheritance but in the expression of the genes. This is a social matter.  
The markers may be there and they have a certain reason for winning out evolutionarily but some are not healthy and die out. Some are there. But all of these are insofar as they are expressed which is the epigenetics thing
