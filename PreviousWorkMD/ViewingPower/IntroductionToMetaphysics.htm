<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            In 1933,
Heidegger committed himself and his thought to the National Socialism.  He
explains this engagement in a letter to his former student Herbert Marcuse, “I
expected from National Socialism a spiritual renewal of life in its entirety, a
recollection of social antagonisms and a deliverance of Western Dasein from the
dangers of communism.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

After the Nazis ejected Professor von Möllendorf, a Social Democrat, from the
rectorate of Freiburg University in 1933, the faculty elected Heidegger as his
replacement.  Since his 1929 essay, <i>What is Metaphysics</i>,<a href="#_ftn2"

expressed a desire to reform the scientific orientation of the German
university towards a more primordial form of knowing.  Therefore, he embraced
his new position as rector. “I was nevertheless absolutely convinced that an
autonomous alliance of intellectuals [<i>der</i> <i>Geistigen</i>, from <i>Geist</i>,
spirit] could deepen and transform a number of essential elements of the
“National Socialist movement” and therefore contribute in its own way to
overcoming Europe’s disarray and the crisis of the Western spirit.”<a

During his tenure, Heidegger made a number of speeches assimilating his

Party did not know if they could trust him to tow the ideological line and

the end of the war.  Based upon a lecture course given in 1935, a year after
Heidegger resigned from the rectorate of the Freiburg University, <u>Introduction
to Metaphysics</u> attempts to establish Heidegger as the proper
spiritual-philosophical leader of National Socialism.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            <u>Introduction
to Metaphysics</u> reinscribes the correlation which Heidegger draws between
power and the light of truth in a more violent, more political language.  In <u>Being
and Time</u>, Heidegger prevents a tragic pathos from overwhelming his analysis
of Dasein by maintaining the rigor of an argument whose language, even in its
radicalness, echoes the soberness of Kant.  In <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>,
this language explodes into a violent rhetoric which echoes the forcefulness of
Nietzsche and Jünger.   Rather than employing almost scholastic categories of
projection and thrownness, which implicitly suggest a dynamic of self-assertion
and self-submission, Heidegger explicitly invokes the terminology of struggle,
of power, and of military combat.  <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u> does not
merely correlate knowledge and power; it establishes an intimacy between the
most profound philosophical knowing and the most terrible political power. 
This text does so by inscribing militarism into its language and by enlisting
its ideas in the service of Germany’s political situation.  Heidegger explains
that, as “perhaps the only real force,”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> philosophy
must become the “thinking that breaks the paths and opens the perspectives of
the knowledge that sets the norms and hierarchies, of the knowledge in which
and by which a people fulfills itself historically and culturally, the
knowledge that kindles and necessitates all inquiries and thereby threatens all
values.”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
Heidegger’s original questioning, like Nietzsche’s revaluation of all values
hitherto, intends to disrupt the political and intellectual structures upon
which the German people has rested complacently.  By maintaining it in a state
of existential insecurity, Heidegger claims that his philosophy can challenge
the German Dasein to struggle towards its historical destiny, the “inner truth
and greatness” of National Socialism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger
spiritualizes power by positing it as the very essence of Being.  He argues
that the Greeks defined Being as physis (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>fusiV</span>.) 
“Physis is Being itself, by virtue of which essents become and remain
observable.  Physis means the power that emerges and the enduring realm under
its sway.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
In this statement, Heidegger explains physis as the power governing temporal
appearing, reinscribing phenomenology as a study of force.  For Heidegger,
beings do not merely appear as posited within an already-created light. 
Rather, the self-exertion of the process of Being brings to light beings which
can stand for themselves, allowing the human observer to gaze upon them. 
Heidegger’s mention of “the enduring realm” under the sway of Being also seems
to posit a certain type of political relationship obtaining between the
singular Being and the manifold beings.  He explains Being through the Greek
word dike (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>dike</span>) which he translates as
the German word <i>Fug</i> (order.)  “Here we understand Fug first in the sense
of joint and framework, then as decree, dispensation, a directive that the
overpowering imposes on its reign; finally, as the governing structure which
compels adaptation and compliance.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
Heidegger describes Being both as a transcendent power which imposes its rule
and an immanent force which compels obedience to this rule.  Being permeates
and collects the world of beings, maintaining the tension between them. 
Because Being articulates itself as this dynamic plurality, one can certainly
read Heidegger’s analysis of Being as privileging the multiple over the
singular.  However, Heidegger himself clearly emphasizes the absolute
domination of Being.  Heidegger argues that this rule is established as
terror.  “The deinon (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>deinon</span>) is the
terrible in the sense of the overpowering power which compels panic fear, true
fear; and in equal measure it is the collected, silent awe that vibrates with
its own rhythm.”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[12]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Just as Being compels obedience to its rule, it compels dread over those it
rules: its sustains its domination through the terror which it inspires.<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Unlike
Hegel, Heidegger does not describe the process of Being as one which
consummates itself.  Whereas the dynamic moments of Hegel’s system eventually
find themselves subsumed within a historical totality, Heidegger’s Being always
maintains an internal dynamic at every moment of history.  Heidegger preserves
this state of internal tension by raising the notion of struggle [<i>Kampf</i>]
to a spiritual-ontological level.  He develops this idea of a primordial
struggle through a reading of Heraclitus fragment concerning polemos (<span
style='font-family:Symbol'>polemoV</span>.)  “This conflict, as Heraclitus
thought it, first caused the realm of Being to separate into opposites”<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[14]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  As
polemos, Being produces itself as a violent convulsion, articulating each
separate essent as an aspect of this combat.  Being manifests essents as those
who it destines to battle each other.  Not only does this interpretation of
Heraclitus approach militarism, it also seems to deliberately echo certain
German polemics against democratic egalitarianism.  Heidegger continues,
“[Polemos] first gave rise to position and order and rank. ... In the conflict
a world comes into being. “<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[15]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> Like
both Nietzsche and the National Socialists, Heidegger argues for the central
importance of rank, distinguishing the weak from the mighty.  For Heidegger,
these differences between the powerful and the impotent are not merely
political or natural.  As polemos, Being itself determines these separations,
stamping each existence with its degree of potency.  Because struggle occurs in
Being as the articulation of opposition, it determines the relationship between
man and Being.  “The deinon as the overpowering (dike: <span style='font-family:
Symbol'>dike</span>) and the deinon as violent (techne: <span style='font-family:
Symbol'>tecne</span>) confront one another, though not as two given things.  In
this confrontation techne bursts forth against dike, which in turn as Fug, the
commanding order, disposes of all techne.  The reciprocal confrontation <i>is</i>. 
It is only insofar as the strangest thing of all, Being-human, is actualized,
insofar as man is present as history.”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
In this statement, Heidegger italicizes the word is, which he defines as the
most pre-eminent expression of Being in language.<a href="#_ftn17"
name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Lacking any direct or indirect object, Heidegger’s sentence “the reciprocal
confrontation <i>is</i>” seems to imply that the reciprocal confrontation
between man and Being correlates with this “is,” with the process of Being
unconcealing itself.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Defined
by his struggle with Being, man’s existence constitutes itself as his
violence.  Heidegger disparages the common conception of violence as arbitrary
brutality.  “In this common usage violence is seen from the standpoint of a
realm which draws its standards from conventional compromise and mutual aid,
and which disparages all violence as a disturbance of the peace.”<a
href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[18]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  By
referring to a standpoint of sight, Heidegger seems to critique the public
desire for peace as a weak visual perspective.  This viewpoint refuses to
engage in heroic conflict, indolently clinging to the complacent security of
the status quo.   In contrast, Heidegger asserts that man is the deinon, “the
powerful in the sense of one who uses power, who not only disposes of power,
but is violent insofar as the use of power is the basic trait not only of his
action but also of his Dasein.”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[19]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
For Heidegger, violence does not merely characterize occasional acts of man’s
Dasein, but rather the entire dynamic of his ontological, temporal being.  
Dasein, as the There of Being, not only exposes itself to the overpowering
power of physis, it struggles against Being, exercising its power against this
overpowering force.  Heidegger continues, “Being itself hurls man into this
breaking away, which drives him beyond himself to venture forth toward Being,
to accomplish Being, to stabilize it in a work, and so hold open the essent as
a whole.  Therefore, the violent one knows no kindness and conciliation; he can
not be mollified by success or prestige.”<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[20]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
According to this statement, Being destines man as a supreme, uncompromising
violence which neither complacent prosperity nor public accolades can
restrain.  Being overpowers man’s Dasein, shattering his stability in its
temporal flow.  This convulsive dynamic opens man up to Being, forcing him into
his conflict with Being.  Man struggles with essents by building poetically, bringing
things into the proper limits and forms which define their Being.  Heidegger
describes this shaping of Being as a struggle against elemental forces such as
the “overpowering sea” and “the indestructible power of the earth.”<a
href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[21]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Dasein asserts itself through its domination of the living creatures which draw
their life force from these elements.  It establishes the limits of these
creatures by subjecting them to the constraints which it imposes upon them. 
Through violent assertion, man disturbs the tranquil growth of the earth,
breaking up the ground through his agriculture, subjugating animals by tearing
them up from their natural environments, “shutting them up in his pens and
enclosures, and forcing them under his yokes.”<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Man
exercises his power against Being through the powers which Being ordains for
him.  Unlike the essents of the earth and sea, man does not capture and
subjugate these existential capacities.  Rather, Being imposes these creative
powers upon man, subjecting him to its dominion.  “The violence of poetic
speech, of thinking projection, of building configuration, of the action that
creates states is not a function of the faculties that man has, but a taming
and ordering of powers by virtue of which the essent opens up as such when man
moves into it.”<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[23]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
In this statement, Heidegger raises the political activity of establishing a
new, revolutionary regime to the same ontological status as the most
fundamental existentials of Dasein’s Being.  He explains how these existentials
relate man to Being.  “It is this breaking out and breaking up, capturing and
subjugating that opens up the essent <i>as</i> sea, <i>as </i>earth, <i>as</i>
animal  It happens only insofar as the powers of language, of understanding,
and of building are themselves mastered in violence.”<a href="#_ftn24"

Man discloses essents through the way he violently dominates them.  However, in
order to open up these essents in their Being, he must first open himself up to
the powers of Being; he must transform himself into the opening for Being.  Man
does not achieves his mastery by lording over the powers of Being, but rather
by taming them, opening himself up to Being so that he can employ the powers of
Being to promote his own violence.  Dasein’s struggle against Being bring his
existential capacities to their full unconcealment.  Similarly, this battle
does not reduce Being’s power, but rather manifests it in its proper light by
gathering it together into its definitive limit and form.  By contending with
Being, man accepts his destined role as the governor of Being, administering
its overpowering power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger’s
uses language and knowledge as the two primary exemplars to illustrate how
these existential capacities both overpower man and give him power.  He
explains that language is not a system invented by man, but rather something
which “reigns within him as the power which he, as the essent he himself is,
must take upon himself.”<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span

Being’s overpowering power dominates man by articulating the power of language
in man, through man, and as man.  Being asserts its power through man’s
creative usage of language.  “Use of power in language in understanding, and
building helps to create (i.e.. always, to bring forth) the violent act of
laying out paths into the environing power of the essent.”<a href="#_ftn26"

using the power which Being has ordained for him, man determines the limits and
forms of essents.  As in <u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger seems to describe
language as having a visual rather than communicative function.<a href="#_ftn27"

After quoting Parmenides, one of the Greeks who inaugurated the great beginning
of philosophy, he explains, “What is said here from within the heart of Being
consists of <i>semata</i>, not signs of Being, not predicates, but indications
which in looking-toward Being from within Being indicate Being.  For in thus
looking towards-Being, we must, in an active sense, look away from all
coming-into-Being and passing-away, etc.; in the act of seeing we must hold
them away, expel them.”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span

Heidegger’s analysis of Parmenides’ language attempts to overturn the
representational conception of language.  Such theories perpetuate an
essentialist metaphysics by separating words from content and subjects from
predicates.  In response, Heidegger contends that language neither symbolizes
the presence of Being nor represents the qualities of the subject Being. 
Language articulates itself through a Dasein situated in Being, directing it
towards Being, and opening it up to Being.  By emphasizing the dynamic of
looking towards and looking away, Heidegger seems to echo <u>Being and Time</u>’s
argument that language determines a specific visual orientation for Being and
Dasein.  Similarly, Heidegger asserts, “In a certain broad sense the Greeks
looked upon language from a visual point of view, that is, starting from the
written language  It is in writing that the spoken language comes to stand. 
Language is, i.e. it stands in the written image of the word. ... But through
the flow of speech, language seeps away into the impermanent.”  In this
statement, Heidegger illuminates the temporal aspect of speech.  He seems to
emphasize the visual dimension of language because it preserves Being in its
proper forms and limits.  Heidegger continues, “But the Greeks also knew of the
phonetic character of language, the phone (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>fone</span>).
... The crucial view of language remains the grammatical view.”<a href="#_ftn29"

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Although
language orients Dasein towards Being, Heidegger warns that public
communication can lead it away from Being.  He states, “Where language speaks
as violent gathering, as a curbing of the overpowering, and as a safeguarding,

language, speech, is at the same time idle talk.”<a href="#_ftn31"

Heidegger warns that Dasein’s usage of language necessarily leads to disaster. 
However, for Heidegger, the term “disaster” does not connote something bad. 
The “disaster” of Being and Dasein’s “safeguarding” can manifest Being in
either unconcealment or concealment.  Dasein gathers Being together in its
proper form and limits by breaking away from conventional understanding,
thereby preserving it from misinterpretation. However, this preservation can
transform into a desire for security which disastrously loses Dasein in the
complacent interpretations of the public realm.  Therefore, Heidegger warns
that the language which gathers Being together into its limit does so as the
public language of das Man, “a concealment rather than disclosure of Being,
dispersion, disorder, and mischief rather than a gathering into structure and
order.”<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span

argues that most people consider the term “Being” as an empty word rather than
as something which brings Being to presence because public culture has
thoroughly corrupted all language.  He asserts,  “that the language in general
is worn out and used up — an indispensable but masterless means of
communication that may be used as one pleases, as indifferent as a means of
public transport, as a street car which everyone uses.   Everyone speaks and
writes away in the language, without hindrance and above all <i>without danger</i>.”<a

Heidegger argues that democratic culture has perverted language by making it
easily accessible to everyone.  He seems to suggest that this complacency can
be overcome if the public reinstitutes the virtue of mastery, supporting
masterful leaders who will take heroic risks in order to illuminate Being through
language.  Similarly, Heidegger explains, “Mere hearing scatters and diffuses
itself in what is commonly believed and said, in hearsay, in <i>doxa</i>,
appearance.  ...  We can truly hear only if we are followers.  ...  The man who

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            As
with language, knowledge relates man’s power to the overpowering Being.  For
Heidegger, knowledge does not connote a simple mastery which enables man to
calculate and dominate the entities around him.  Rather, as the understanding
of apprehension, knowing requires that man open himself up to the mastery of
Being. Heidegger explains that Being posits Dasein as the site in which it
discloses itself.  “Being dominates, but because and insofar as it dominates
and appears, appearing and <i>with</i> it apprehension must <i>also</i> occur.
... The particularity of Being-human will grow from the particularity of its
belonging to Being as dominant appearing.  And since apprehension — accepting
apprehension of what shows itself — belongs to such appearing, it may be
presumed that this is precisely what determines the essence of Being-human”<a

Heidegger describes man’s existence as a function of the self-assertive
development of Being.  In its process of self-manifestation, Being [Sein]
requires the There [Da] of Dasein as the space in which to manifest itself. 
Heidegger therefore explains Dasein’s responsive apprehension to Being as
something which is determined by and as the dominion of Being itself.  Being
establishes its There by subjecting Dasein to its becoming, positing Dasein as
the breach for its temporal explosion, uprooting Dasein from its security and
shattering its complacency.  However, Heidegger does not consider Dasein’s
response to the incursion of Being to be a pure passivity.  “To apprehend in
this twofold sense means to let something come to one, not merely accepting,
however, but taking a receptive attitude toward that which shows itself.  When
troops prepare to receive the enemy, it is in the hope of stopping him at the
very least, of bringing him to stand.  This receptive bringing-to-stand is meant
by noiein [<span style='font-family:Symbol'>noiein</span>.]”<a href="#_ftn36"

before, Heidegger describes his ontological reflections using military
metaphors, raising combat to a spiritual level.  Dasein does not allow
overpowering Being to massacre it, but rather prepares for it in a strategic
defense formation.  Apprehension thereby transforms the subjection imposed by
Being into a power, allowing Dasein to take over its thrownness in its
self-projection.  Just as Being struggles against Dasein as the overpowering
dike, knowledge develops as the power of man’s techne “the basic trait of
deinon, the violent; for violence is the use of power against the
overpowering.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span

Heidegger perpetuates the militaristic intonations of his language by
correlating knowledge with strength.  He states “What has the higher rank is
the stronger.  Therefore, Being, the logos as gathering and harmony, is not
easily accessible and not accessible to all in the same form. ... The true is
not for every man, but only for the strong.”<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"

As before, Heidegger inscribes an aristocratic notion of rank into the
ontological structure of Being.  In an extreme display of anti-democratic
sentiment, Heidegger argues that knowledge can not be equally accessed by
everyone.  He insists that the masses are like dogs and donkeys, feeding off easy
solutions, incapable of genuine understanding.  Understanding only manifests
itself to the strong man, the creative man who oversteps the constraints of
everyday tranquillity, of a complacent peace, and dares to engage in combat.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Man
achieves the limit of his full openness to Being when his apprehension
manifests itself as a questioning attitude.  Heidegger describes this attitude
as the “will to know.  He who wills, he who puts his whole existence into a
will, is resolved ... To know is accordingly, the ability to stand in the
manifestness of the essent, to endure it.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"

In this statement, Heidegger drafts the language of <u>Being and Time</u> into
a voluntarist ethos.  Following Nietzsche, he understands knowledge as a <i>will</i>
to truth rather than as a disinterested search for facts.  For Heidegger, the
most authentic knowledge arises when Dasein understands knowing as
self-assertion.  This self assertion enables Dasein to stand heroically against
the assault of the overpowering.  Because Being occurs as a temporal process,
each moment both creates and shatters the forms and limits of Being.  Dasein’s
Being constantly shatters against the possibility of death.  Being’s dynamic
unfolds as a constant revolution, disrupting every point of stability as soon
as it is founded.  Therefore, questioning Dasein authentically confronts the
assault of Being once it braves the possibility of nonbeing.  Heidegger states,
“This essent, through questioning, is held out into the possibility of
nonbeing.  Thereby the why takes on a very different power of penetration.”<a

Similarly, he states, “To press inquiry into Being explicitly to the limits of
nothingness, to draw nothingness into the question of Being —  this is the
first and only fruitful step toward a true transcending of nihilism”<a

Dasein’s heroic confrontation with nothingness brings itself to authenticity
and Being to unconcealment.  In contrast, the fearful public sphere conceals
Being and disperses Dasein by refusing to contend with these negations. 
Nihilism occurs when this public focuses on the essent at the expense of Being,
attempting to ignore the shadow of nothingness which underlies each temporal
appearance.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
proper apprehension of Being requires that Dasein struggle to disclose the
proper visual appearance of Being.  Heidegger locates the historical origin of
this struggle in Greek thought and art.  “[The Greeks] were perpetually
compelled to wrest Being from appearance and preserve it against appearance ...
The great age of Greece was a single creative self-assertion amid the confused,
intricate struggle between the powers of Being and appearance.”<a href="#_ftn42"

Heidegger explains that those who inaugurated <i>the</i> great beginning of
philosophy, the Greeks, strove for the appropriate visual disclosure of Being. 
Before the advent of Plato, Greek thinkers did not denigrate manifestation as a
“mere appearance” of transcendental principles.  Instead, they attended to the
essential ambiguity of appearance, to the manner in which it both discloses and
conceals Being.  Being occurs as a process of self-blossoming manifestation in
the momentary appearances which limit it and shape it.  By disclosing itself in
this manner, this process of appearing risks being mistaken for a set of
permanent substances which underlie these appearances.   The Greeks responded
to this ontological situation by disclosing the Being which concealed itself as
appearances and by protecting Being against this concealment.  Heidegger
describes this Greek effort as a power, as the creative self-assertion which
imposes limits and establishes forms.  He continues, “Logos here stands in
closest connection with krinein [<span style='font-family:Symbol'>krinein</span>,]
to separate in the sense of de-cide, in collecting toward the collectedness of
Being.  Selection is the foundation and proof of the pursuit of Being and the
battle against appearance, to set a measure that will determine rank.”<a

this statement Heidegger correlates the artistic production of works with a
determination of the military virtue of rank.  He continues, “To be a man means
to take gathering upon oneself, to undertake a gathering apprehension of the
Being of the essent, the sapient incorporation of appearing in the work, and so
to administer unconcealment, to preserve it against cloaking and concealment.” <a

Dasein gathers Being together into its proper limits by resolutely choosing a
possibility which will manifest the greatness of Dasein and Being.   Creative

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Dasein
seizes upon this creative mode of apprehension by refusing the complacent,
public mode of disclosure.  Explaining that authentic Dasein must decide for
Being, against nothingness, and must struggle with appearance, Heidegger
argues, “But such essential decision must use violence if it is to preserve
against the continuous pressure of involvement in the everyday and
commonplace.  The violence of this decisive departure along the path to the
Being of the essent wrests man out of his home in what happens to be nearest

In this statement, Heidegger seems to equate the everyday world of the public
with nonbeing, or at least with the concealment of Being in its appearance. 
During the process of its appearing, Being discloses aspects which can
potentially be viewed by anyone.  Public interpretations conceal Being by
fixing these momentary aspects as the very essence of Being.  Dasein must
overcome these public distortions by wrenching himself out of this public
complacency, daring to posit Being anew as a creative work.  Not only does this
heroic venture disclose Being in its unconcealment, it manifests Dasein in its
authenticity.  “It is logos as ingathering, as man’s collecting himself toward
fitness that first brings Being-human into its essence, so thrusting it into
homelessness, insofar as the home is dominated by the appearance of the
ordinary, customary, and commonplace.”<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"

argues that man falls away from Being and from his own Dasein when he tires of
this struggle and seeks complacent security.  He describes this refusal of
conflict as man’s most drastic and most violent negation of Being.  “Time and
time again the violent ones must shrink back in fear from this use of force and
yet they are unable to forego it.  Amid this reluctant will to mastery, the
suspicion is bound to flare up at times that perhaps the overpowering will be
most securely and completely dominated if the concealment of Being — the
emerging power, whose essence is logos, the collectedness of the conflicting —
is simply preserved, if in a certain sense every possibility of appearing, of
manifestation, is denied.”<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span

According to this analysis, Dasein’s struggle against the overpowering is
threatened by the possibility that Dasein, exhausted by the fight, might give
up the battle.  Dasein might shrink back in fear, being unable to stand in the
light of Being, unable to withstand the dread it feels confronting the terror
of Being’s negativity.  This shrinking back exists as a potential within all of
Dasein’s self-assertions.  Dasein violently gathers together Being by
poetically breaking away from its familiar surroundings and creating a new,
revolutionary order in the world.  Dasein’s creation of a certain stability
opens up the possibility that it might settle down in that order rather than
maintaining a perpetual struggle to overcome the situation which it has created
for itself.  Instead of maintaining the tension, the potency, and the dread of
his existential situation, man might retreat into cowardly complacency.  
Through this refusal of struggle, man does not renounce violence, but rather
commits the most terrible violence against Being and against himself.  By
avoiding struggle, Dasein shuts itself off from the unconcealment of Being,
refusing to open itself up as the site for Being’s disclosure.  Dasein thereby
prevents itself from asserting its creative power, its possibilities, in the
world, affirming itself as the negation of Dasein, not-Dasein.  Just as
Nietzsche argued that man vivisected its own animal instincts when it was

impotent retreat from the struggle with Being correlates with a perversion of
his understanding.  Heidegger explains, “Man’s Dasein changes accordingly.  The
slow end of this history, the slow end in which we have long been standing, is
the domination of thinking as <i>ratio</i> (in the sense of understanding as
well as reasoning) over the <i>Being</i> of the essent.”<a href="#_ftn50"

When man denies himself the strength to take the great risk of battling with
Being itself, his thinking asserts its dominion over the Being of essents.  In
effect, he transforms from a hero into a petty tyrant, into a demagogue,
lording his rule over a multiplicity which he can easily conquer.  Man does so
by reinterpreting spirit as intelligence.  He thereby asserts his intelligence
through the cleverness<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span

scientific calculation, organizing essents into determinable categories. 
Heidegger argues that this interpretation transforms spirit into a manipulable
tool, causes knowledge to be classified into compartmentalized sciences, and
ultimately converts spirit into a cultural ornament.  Once the spiritual
activity of understanding one’s existence becomes so degraded, people adopt the
attitude that “it suffices to know the essent and to secure our mastery over

Heidegger’s repeated condemnations of security seem to be directed against
modern philosophy, especially against Cartesian epistemology.  In his <u>Meditations
on First Philosophy</u>, Descartes quests for a secure foundation for certain
knowledge.  Contemplating the insecurity of the sensory knowledge of external
appearances, Descartes posits a certain foundation within and as his own
subjectivity.  The modern knower thereby achieves his mastery over the world by
converting Being into a set of objects.  He perceives essents as actual things
rather than as dynamic possibilities which Dasein and Being continuously change
in their struggle.  Rather than affirming his nature as the open site for this
conflict, the Cartesian subject ignores the temporal process of Being,
stabilizing things as quiddities, as abstract and eternal essences.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            According
to Heidegger, this perversion of understanding began with Plato who, unable to
maintain the greatness of the Greek beginning, posited Being as idea (<span

decline when the space for Being’s unconcealment — presumably Dasein as the
site of disclosure — collapses.  For the Greeks, the term idea referred to the
aspect which Being’s appearing discloses to man’s vision.  By interpreting
Being as idea, Dasein separates itself from Being by interpreting itself as an
observer of Being rather than a participant in the struggle with Being.  “Where
the struggle ceases, the essent does not vanish, but the world turns away.  The
essent is no longer asserted (i.e. preserved as such.)  ... The original
emergence and standing of energies, the phainesthai [<span style='font-family:

world-epiphany, becomes a visibility of things that are already made and can be
pointed out.  The eye, the vision, which originally projected the project into

Explicitly associating <u>Being and Time</u>’s references to projection with
his language of power, Heidegger explains that an authentic manifestation of
Being requires Dasein’s constant engagement in its struggle with Being.  When
man stops asserting himself, he perverts his vision and Being’s unconcealment. 
Dasein’s visual disengagement from the world, his objectification of it, indicates
his fundamental impotence.  Man’s impotence asserts itself as a power through
the paralysis of the power of Being.   “Appearing in the first and authentic
sense as bringing-itself-to-stand in togetherness involves space, which it
first conquers.”<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span

the temporal process of Being’s appearing, man looks at frozen, momentary
appearances as if they subsisted permanently by themselves.  Heidegger argues
that man refers appearances back to his own visual perspective rather than
Being once he traps himself in the complacency of familiar, public existence.

The disastrous decline of spirit forces Germany to choose whether it will let
these nihilistic pincers crush it into submission or whether it will confront
these negations, fight for the unconcealment of Being, and affirm the
authenticity of itself.  Heidegger insists that the German nation will either
submit to the “darkening of the world,”<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

disempowerment of the spirit, or will begin a new beginning “more radically,
with all the strangeness, darkness, insecurity that attend a true beginning.”<a

Heidegger explains that America and Russia exert the pressure which presents Germany
with the possibility of submission or triumph.  “In America and Russia [the
deterioration of spirit into intelligence] grew into a boundless etcetera of
indifference and always-the-sameness — so much so that the quantity took on a
quality of its own.  Since then the domination in those countries of a cross
section of the indifferent mass has become something more than a dreary
accident.  It has become an active onslaught that destroys all rank and every
world-creating impulse of the spirit, and calls it a lie.  This is the
onslaught of what we call the demonic (in the sense of destructive evil.)”<a

position:relative;top:0pt'>[59]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  In
this statement, Heidegger encourages an already militaristic Germany to
confront this spiritual threat by literally demonizing its opponents.  Echoing
Nietzsche’s critique of the mob-instinct which animates democracy and
communism, Heidegger applies his critique of das Man to Germany’s military
enemies, America and Russia.  Heidegger takes the global dominance of these
countries as a sign that mass culture and the analytical sciences which it
perpetuates threatens to eradicate the genuine spiritual culture and
philosophical reflection of Germany.  He inscribes this cultural transformation
in a tragic plot.  This massification of man will destroy genuine greatness,
genuine expressions of creative power, preventing Dasein from daring to do
anything exceptional, wrenching it back down to the realm of the commonplace,
the familiar.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger’s
perception of this spiritual decline causes him to commit himself to the
politics of National Socialism.  In saying this however, one must understand
what the political signifies for Heidegger.  Heidegger claimed that he had only
committed himself to a “private National Socialism” which did not necessarily
correlate with the one which actually unfolded itself in German history. 
However, this statement does not imply that Heidegger’s commitments lay at an
individual level rather than a socio-political one.  Many commentators have
wondered how the author of the individualistic philosophy of <u>Being and Time</u>
could have committed himself to the demagoguery of Nazism.  For example, Jurgen
Habermas  reflects upon his reaction to Heidegger’s political commitment,
saying “Heidegger had treated the whole framework of <u>Being and Time</u>
without any obvious change up to 1933.  Then he suddenly gave it a collectivist
turn:  Dasein was no longer this poor Kierkegaardian-Sartrean individual
hanging in the air, in <i>Sorge</i> [Care.]  But now Dasein was the Dasein of
the people, of the <i>Volk</i>.”<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[60]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Even though much of Heidegger’s <u>Being and Time</u> evokes an individualist
reading, Heidegger never <i>identifies</i> Dasein as an individual human being,
but rather as the historical location where Being discloses itself.  In his
speeches of 1930s, Heidegger posits Germany as the corporate Dasein which has
opened itself up most profoundly to the unconcealment of Being.   Urging the
German populace to support Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State by
voting to withdraw Germany from the League of Nations, Heidegger proclaims,
“[The Führer] is giving the people the possibility of making, directly, the
highest free decision of all:  whether the entire people wants its own Dasein
or whether it does <i>not </i>want it.”<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[61]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Similarly, in <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>, Heidegger demonstrates his
hopes for its fascist government by figuring the public arena of the polis as
the site of historical struggle.  He states  “Polis [<span style='font-family:
Symbol'>poliV</span>] means the place, the there, wherein and as which
historical Dasein is.  The polis is the historical place, the there <i>in </i>which,<i>
out of </i>which, and<i> for </i>which history happens ... [This place] is
political, i.e. at the site of history, provided there be (for example) poets <i>alone</i>,
but then really poets, priests <i>alone</i>, but then really priests, rulers <i>alone</i>,
but then really rulers.”<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[62]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
In this statement, Heidegger elevates the political arena to an ontological
level, defining it as the place, the There, where the spiritual-ontological destiny
of Being itself is decided historically.  By taking this decision upon
themselves, the three political leaders, the poet, priest, and ruler,
heroically establish an authentic public space for Being’s unconcealment. 
Heidegger continues, “<i>Be</i>, but this means as violent men to use power, to
become preeminent.”<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[63]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
By putting the word “Be” in italics, this statement ontologically supports the
political model of an authoritarian Führer who rules through violence, forging
the fate of the German nation.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            In
committing himself to this notion of a national Dasein ruled by an
authoritarian Führer, Heidegger maintains his critique of the unthinking mass
sensibility of das Man, the consciousness which dominates bureaucratic
countries such as America and Russia, which manifests itself as positivism and
communism, and which threatens to conquer the globe.  By pledging himself to a
“private National Socialism,” Heidegger seems to indicate his disdain for the
demagogic aspects of Nazism, the ways in which it pandered to the shallow
desires and aspirations of the German public.  Rather than attempting to
satisfy the demands of the masses, Germany’s authentic political leaders must
tear themselves away from the security of their customary lives.  “Pre-eminent
in the historical place, they become at the same time <i>apolis</i> [<span
style='font-family:Symbol'>apoliV</span>,] without city and place, lonely,
strange, and alien, without issue amid the essent as a whole, and at the same
time without statute and limit, without structure and order, because they
themselves <i>as</i> creators must first create all this.”<a href="#_ftn64"

According to Heidegger’s ontological analysis, the authentic, fascist ruler
needs neither law nor public consensus to establish his tyrannical rule.  As an
original creator, he takes upon himself the responsibility and the risk of
establishing a new, revolutionary regime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Just
as Heidegger advocates for an authoritarian ruler, a Führer, the German title
of the <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>, <i>Einführung in die Metaphysik</i>,
implies that he himself will assume the parallel role of the priest who leads
[führung] the German people into (ein) their metaphysical destiny.<a

argues that the German nation as a whole must, through struggle, rise to lead Europe
out of its decline.  By taking a creative view of its tradition, Germany must
unleash the spiritual power of its repeatable historical possibilities.  
Heidegger explains, “Spirit is the mobilization of the powers of the essent as
such and as a whole.  It is indispensable if the peril of world darkening is to
be forestalled and if our nation in the center of the Western world is to take
on its historical mission.”<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span

Heidegger undoubtedly uses the term “mobilization” as a deliberate allusion to
Ernst Jünger’s essay Total Mobilization, a text which heavily influenced his thinking
during the 1930s.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[67]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Like Heidegger, Jünger warns that mass movements of both the left and the right
are putting the German “dream of freedom” under a “pincers’ iron grasp.”<a
href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

position:relative;top:0pt'>[68]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  To
remedy this, Jünger recommends that Germany should mobilize all of its
resources towards war so that it can effect the “mobilization of the German,”
so that each German man can encounter himself as a stronger force, so that he
can realize himself in the midst of the battlefield.<a href="#_ftn69"

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Although
Heidegger consciously evokes the martial spirit of Nietzsche and Jünger, he
tries to distinguish his ontological thinking from the theories of Nazi
propagandists.  Supporting the fascist campaign against intellectualism, he
warns that, by simply opposing it, Nazi ideologues might reproduce a similarly
lifeless body of thought.   He states, “They may not be intellectualists but
they come from the same source.   This spiritual conservatism, stemming partly
from natural inertia and partly from conscious effort, has become the feeding
ground of political reaction.   The misinterpretation of thought and the abuse
to which it leads can be overcome only by an authentic thinking that goes back
to the roots — and <i>by nothing else</i>.”  Heidegger seems to direct this
critique of quasi-intellectualism against philosophers of race such as Alfred
Rosenberg.<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span

“The spirit falsified into intelligence falls to the level of a tool in the
service of others  ... whether it is applied to the organization and regulation
of a nation’s vital resources and race — in any case the spirit as intelligence
becomes the impotent superstructure of something else.” <a href="#_ftn71"

Heidegger contends that, like American positivism and Russian Marxism, Nazi
racism disempowers spirit by misinterpreting it as a technological implement. 
He states at the end of his lecture, “The works that are being peddled about
nowadays as the philosophy of National Socialism have nothing whatever to do
with the inner truth and greatness of this movement (namely the encounter
between global technology and modern man) — have all been written by men
fishing in the troubled waters of “values” and “totalities.””<a href="#_ftn72"

This conclusion of <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u> seems to reflect
Heidegger’s personal conclusion that only a philosophy as radical and
revolutionary as his own could satisfy the spiritual needs of a movement as
radical and revolutionary as Nazism.  </p>

how absolute freedom transforms into absolute terror to Heidegger’s description

after the spirit has been objectified into Utility and before it has been
transformed into morality.  Perhaps one could apply this Hegelian juxtaposition
to situate Heidegger between utilitarian science and Levinas’ ethics. 
Furthermore, one could parallel this discussion with a comparison of how the
Reign of Terror and Nazism consummate the epoch of reason and of modernity. [<u>The

style='font-family:Times'>However, Heidegger states, “for to be a man is to
speak.  man says yes and no only because in his profound essence he is a
speaker, <i>the </i>speaker.  That is his distinction and at the same time his
burden .... Even if we had a thousand eyes and a thousand ears, if our essence
did not include the power of language, all essents would be closed to us, the
essent that we ourselves are no less than the essent that we are not.” (p. 82) 
Although this statement sounds like it depreciates vision in comparison to
speaking, I would argue that Heidegger intends to point towards the
relationship which obtains between language and vision.  Comparing language to
ears makes sense because ears respond to linguistic input, but how does
language relate to the eyes?  Heidegger states, “True hearing has nothing to do
with ear and mouth, but means:  to follow the <i>logos </i>and what it is,
namely the collectedness of the collectedness of the essent itself.” (p. 129)
Here, Heidegger seems to emphasize that hearing  does not orient a subject who
hears to a heard object through the medium of a sensory organ, but rather is a
process where Dasein opens to Being, letting it work through him.  Perhaps
Heidegger’s depreciation of the thousand eyes intends to condemn the same
sensory model of experience.  Perhaps Heidegger is trying to assert that,
whereas we assume our own viewpoint, Being works through us in speech. </span></p>

honor cleverness to a far greater degree:  namely, as a condition of existence
of the first importance.” (<u>On The Genealogy of Morals</u>  39-39)  It should
be noted that this sort of argument was and still is invoked by anti-Semites
who contrast the noble authenticity of their people (e.g. Aryans) to the “scheming

style='font-family:Times'>  With Hitler as the ruler, Heidegger as the priest,
the poet would, of course, have to be Hölderlin.  Throughout his career, but
especially during the war, Heidegger used Hölderlin’s poetry and thought to
meditate on the destiny of the German nation.  He wrote the essay “Wie wenn am
Feiertage...” as a preface to the volume of Hölderlin’s poetry which many
German soldiers read in the trenches.  For a recent discussion of the political
implications of Heidegger’s readings of Hölderlin and Trakl, see Veronique
Foti’s   <u>Heidegger and the Poets:  Poesis, Sophia, Techne</u>. [Princeton,
New Jersey:  Humanities Press International, 1992.]  It would be interesting to
read Plato’s condemnation of poetry against Heidegger’s usage of it.  In <u>The
Republic</u>, Socrates gives two reasons for excluding poets from the
Republic.  In Book 8, he explains, “And therefore, I said, the tragic poets
being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we
do not receive them into our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny. 
In Book 10, Socrates argues that poetry is merely a mimetic representation of
objects which themselves represent the ideas.  He states that poets distance
men from the truth so much that they cause men to have an uneven temperament
rather than to maintain a rational equanimity and to focus on pleasure and pain
rather than on justice.  What is the relationship between these two separate
reasons?  Is Heidegger’s condemnation of mimetic representation correlated with
his commitment to Nazism?  How are these two factors connected to Heidegger’s
reappraisal of affectivity?  One would start asking these questions through a
close reading of Heidegger’s 1936-37 lecture course, <u>Nietzsche:  The Will to
Power as Art</u>, in which he critiques <u>The Republic</u>’s analysis of
mimesis for its separation of the sensuous and supersensuous.  This course also
emphasizes the importance of the will to power expressed in affective states
like <i>Rausch</i> [“rapture.”] One should also look at <i>Platons Lehre von
der Wahrheit</i>.</span></p>

style='font-family:Times'>  In the 1966 interview “Only a God Can Save Us”
Heidegger states, “In 1936, I began the Nietzsche lectures.  Anyone with ears
to hear heard in these lectures a confrontation with National Socialism.”  [<u>The
Heidegger Controversy</u>  p. 101]  This self-defense seems to point towards
Heidegger’s consistent critique, especially in the third course, The Will to
Power as Knowledge, of philosophers who interpret Nietzsche’s thought as a
biologism.  See David Farrell Krell’s <u>Daimon Life: Heidegger and
Life-Philosophy</u>  [Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1992] and
his analysis in the third volume of the Nietzsche lectures for a good
discussion of this confrontation. </span></p>
