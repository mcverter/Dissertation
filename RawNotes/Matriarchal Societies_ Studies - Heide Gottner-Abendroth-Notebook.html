She is custodian of the clan’s property—not with an eye to her own gain, but for the whole clan, for whose well-being she is responsible. She guides distribution of the common wealth, taking care that it is shared out equally, and according to the needs of each, in a give-and-take economy that could well be called a clan internal “gift economy.”7 Her responsibility is based on natural bonds, not on abstraction, since all of the clan members are her sisters and brothers, her daughters and sons, for whom she cares. In the clan house, among her close relatives she is possessed of a natural authority, rather than a power over them, as encountered in patriarchal domination roles, where people’s needs and wants are not considered. Natural authority means, on her part, giving advice and, on their part, voluntary choice about accepting it or not: a relationship that develops out of family respect.

This follows from the circumstances of the society itself: women give men the food they eat, provide the shelter of a roof over their heads, and give them their tribal identity in life as well as in death (through burial in the clan grave). In this way the man figures as a helper and colleague in all the important matters of life, but he is never his own ruler.</h3>

Men, on the other hand, do not own land as their clan heritage, and they may not sell agricultural produce.Women, who are completely self-sufficient, exclusively carry out trade in farm and household products; this is the economic basis of Adat and of the villages. 16</h3>

What is retained in this switching of gender roles is the traditional appearance and spheres of life associated with each sex—the female-male polarity is not discarded. This is because matriarchal cultures are grounded, at each level of society, in the practical and symbolic equilibrium of both of these polar spheres—no matter how differently these are defined from culture to culture. This way of ordering the world cannot be broken by the personal preferences of individuals.48</h3>

In this figure we can recognize the ancient Mexican Earth Goddess and Mother of all Beings, worshipped under so many different names in the region. For the Zapotec she was Nohuichana and associated with the water and fishing. Through the missionary influence of the Spanish invaders, many Mexican earth goddesses came to be identified with the Virgin Mary, and this was also true of Nohuichana.

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 6974</div><div class='noteText'>Rather, these feuds resembled a tournament between men of comparable size and experience, marked by frequent pauses. The goal was not so much killing, as capturing the enemy. If someone was killed, the death was treated as a misfortune, so that actual killings were isolated, regretted incidents, since these dead pulled more dead along with them: every clan was sworn to protect and defend its members, which meant there was a religious duty to avenge murder. But it did not come to the European-style blood vendettas, because these feuds typically ended in Iroquoian-style sports, in which team sports won or lost determined the outcome.34</h3>

Additionally, the young men who set off in a war party had to be supplied by the women with long-lasting provisions of cornmeal; otherwise, they could not carry out these forays. The women apportioned the food not only for the feuds, but also for the trade expeditions, so the final decisions about these things were in women’s hands. By withholding their political and economic assent, women in the village or town could stop a feud from taking place.

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>14.5 Iroquois economy</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 7085</div><div class='noteText'>in Iroquoian society was based on their role in the economy. The Iroquois, like other matriarchal societies, had no private property. All property belonged to the social group; land and house were the property of the clan. However, within the clan women had the sole right to land. The territory controlled by the community was also in women’s hands; men were not entitled to own land. The harvest belonged solely to the women, who shared it out to the rest of the household based on need.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 7088</div><div class='noteText'>This arrangement is enshrined in yet another important right in the Iroquoian Constitution pertaining to women: they are the sole keepers of Mother Earth.

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>14.6 Iroquois medicine societies and mythology</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 7125</div><div class='noteText'>The gifts were of food and furs, quills and ceremonially significant feathers, clothing, and wampum belts, which were valuable as records of important civil affairs and, sometimes, more decorative and commemorative. The supply of food and gift items was in the hands of the Gantowisas, which meant that they had explicit responsibility for rendering and maintaining the Iroquoian gift economy. This was a clear expression of the resonance between the gift giving Earth and gift giving women: just as the mound beds were regarded as the breasts of Mother Earth, the corn her milk, so the gifting of the Gantowisas was compared with breast-feeding.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 7134</div><div class='noteText'>gift giving, which renewed their peaceful relationships. All this meant that the Iroquois economy was based on a network of smaller and larger gift giving circles.60</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 7154</div><div class='noteText'>societies. The Iroquois word “Orenda” signifies the two-part energy in all beings and things: coming together like East and West or North and South to create an over-arching, divine cosmic energy. It was the job of the medicine, or spiritual societies to hold the halves of this Orenda energy in a dynamic balance. For individuals, this meant health as a balance of body and spirit, but it could also mean the political balance of the community—that is, between the genders and between the generations as well as the balance between humans and nature. All the visions, dreams, dances, and ceremonies of a medicine society aimed towards this balance.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 7177</div><div class='noteText'>The Ogiwe Society, or Death Singers, is dedicated to the secrets of death and rebirth. The women focus on the powers of withering, dying, and transforming; their society complements the Towisas Society. Their ritual responsibilities concern death, the realm of the dead, reverence to the ancestors, and rebirth, all of which were originally in</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 7179</div><div class='noteText'>domain of women. Only women may lead funeral ceremonies and guide the dead into the Otherworld. The public Dance-of-death Ceremonies, which are very ancient, are performed by this society from late autumn until early spring. All these rituals take place at night. The Dance-of-death is probably danced on the fire, a spiritual art mastered by Ogiwe women, but the most important event is the Feast of the Dead, held every ten years, to which all the dead are invited. As contact with spirits of the dead is quite dangerous, this society possesses powerful healing rituals designed to cure the “spirit sickness” that can result when a dead person’s unhappy soul comes into the midst of the living. Both these women’s medicine societies reflect the entire cycle of the year, and of human life, as it is understood in matriarchal spirituality.69</h3>
