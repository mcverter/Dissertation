SECTION:  “Respect for the Diversity of Tactics”
*             ii) Intellectual discourse is too often conceived as a fight -- Can my Hegel beat up your Heidegger; can my Russell beat up your Hegel; etc.  
*             iii) The aim being to assert the superiority of my tradition of thinking over yours
*             iv) We are capable as thinkers and actors to accept a diversity of tactics; to explore one’s own avenue of subversion while respecting or at least attending to another avenue.
*             v) one of the best traits of Hegel is his generosity in thinking; his belief that there must be an element of Truth in every thought for it to exist
*             vi) Explore alternatives to Hegel 
*                 (1) Explore Levinas, conversation, inheritance of thought
*                 (2) Maybe also Nagarjuna’s critique of “svabha” self-existent entities
*                 (3) would be cool to get madhyahamika / Nagarjuna in here too  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C5%ABlamadhyamakak%C4%81rik%C4%81
*                     (a) Neither from itself nor from another.  Nor from both. Nor without a cause, Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.[8]
*                     (b) If intrinsic nature (svabhava) does not exist, of what will there be alteration?  If intrinsic nature does exist, of what will there be alteration?
*                     (c) Although (the term) "self" is caused to be known (of, about), and although (a doctrine or teaching of) "no self" is taught.   No "self" or any "nonself" whatsoever has been taught by the Buddhas
*                     (d) This is probably a footnote
*                 (4) The already-Othering of the Same
*                 (5) Maybe somewhere in Derrida too.  
*         b) Passage in Levinas Totality and Infinity about community of inherited conversation
*         c) No political change through emotional violence
*             i) White fragility and white tears -- shaming people for their weakness, vulnerability, neediness
*             ii) Ressentiment Nietzsche (Aragorn, post@) 
*             iii) “Are we fooled by morality” --Levinas
*             iv) Nietzsche Moral thought is violence.  it is actually a will to power
