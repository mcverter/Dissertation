## The Dancers

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

You're in the first paragraph!

We must imagine Levinas and Nietzsche as friends, -- our friends, tricksters all, have been friends of theirs [[0](#0)] -- friends as Blanchot and Levinas were friends, friends as Derrida and Levinas were friends, laughing with one another, drunken, carousing madmen playing in a night of pagan bacchanal, of drunken orgy, of erotic reproduction, genealogy, continuous creation, recreation, play; alongside Baudelaire and Benjamin; alongside Rimbaud; alongside Spinoza and Hume and Bergson and Deleuze; dancing atop the Talmud tabletops after a fabrengen of too much cheap vodka and even cheaper beer; two dancers more iconoclastic than either lonely nomadic Abram or solitary Zarathustra in their whirling, in their smashing of graven images, in their fracturing of the Lurianic Tiqqun, in their shattering the vessels again in the apostasy of Sabbatai Tzvi and the antinomianism of Jacob Frank, celebrating together the heresy of joy, of beautiful pagan multiplicity, of Joseph's multicolored patchwork coat; as inverters subverters perverters and reverters.

Dancing is not war. Even in their contradiction, contra-diction, dictating against each other, as two Saids saying the polar opposte, they never declare each other as enemies, never discriminate between each other as freind and enemy in war and murder; if anything these fighters become frenemies as they wrestle in the Coliseums of Sophistry, rhyding and riding, oiled up and rock solid, each trying to pin the other down in their disagreements; yet they still remain friends throughout; always/already, to even have entered the _agora_ together, they must have always/already recognized each other as worthy opponents, as friends.

Dancing sometimes is like killing and sometimes is like fucking. Party hardy!

Sing, sing this eulogy together:

> Can you cough it up loud and strong?
> .. The immigrants:
> .. They wanna sing all night long



## Metaphor as Polemic

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The tone of the moral voice in Levinas interpretation can be heard already in the tropes used in a recent article on Levinas's usage of of metaphor. The first line of the Abstract of Scott Davidson's "Metaphorical Transcendence" announces "In his published work, Levinas only mentions metaphor for the sake of dismissing its relevance to his ethics of transcendence." (366)

From even before the beginning of the article itself, in its preface and distillation, Davidson considers Levinas to be engaged in a polemic against metaphor. Within the first line, a struggle emerges between our protagonist Levinas and the category of metaphor itself, which Davidson describes as something that Levinas considers "only for the sake of dismissing it." Before we even consider the merits of Davidson's argument, we are already struck by the violence of the language -- the category of metaphor is described as something that is forcibly discarded, tossed into the trash as worthless. Is such aggressive language appropriate for commentaries on the writing of Levinas, a text that opens by questioning whether phisophical thought has too often considered the truth of Being, the being of Truth, in terms of war, of Heraclitean _polemos_ (TI 18)? And should a scholar of Levinas resort to metaphors of deprecation that cast the enemy interlocutor as something cast out, discarded as garbage; especially when one considers how frequently his tropes describe ethical encounters with the Other (and the Self) in terms of misery, as naked and cold, as homeless and hungry, as outcast, dismissed, and discarded?

Levinas's question of whether Western thought and culture is rooted in war echoes the analysis of feminist scholar Nancy Hartsock. Hartsock recounts a genealogy of how much our conceptualization and action still inherit from the heritage of the birth of the Greek _polis_ (city-state) from what she terms the "barracks community." Within this military encampment, human relationships were conceived as being fundamentally antagonistic and competitive, as struggles for power and domination. Hartsock claims that war and the masculine role of the warrior-hero have been central to our conception of politics ever since: for example, as the citizen's dominance on the battlefield of rhetoric of the _agora_, and as the businessman’s dominance on the field of commerce (Hartsock, 1982, pp. 285”“6). To the extent that the ideal of the philosopher is rooted in Heraclitean polemics or in Plato's claim that the ideal military guardians of the _polis_ should be philosophers, hasn't philosophy also inherited the terminology, equally martial and juridical, of argument and struggle? To what extent is philosophy committed to a fantasy of a War for Truth?

In a manner typical of many philosophers and especially many scholars of Levinas, Davidson alludes to the imaginary of the Barracks Community in his article, repeatedly invoking metaphors of combat, invoking the wartime division of dialectic analysis as friend and enemy. For the most part, Davidson's usage of such terminology is relatively benign, so commonplace that one could easily fail to hear the martial echoes of "aligning" metaphor and disclosre (367) or "dividing philosophical treatments of metaphors into two camps." (368) Davidson can only resolve the metaphorics of war through an antinomy of the wartime ally and the wartime enemy by claiming "Levinas’s stance, as a result, is at once aligned with and against metaphor." From this quote another martial metaphorics can be discerned: the positionality of the philosopher is a "stance", a position that has been "staked out" in a field of battle.

Within this theater of war, Levinas occupies a strategic position, on the one hand attacking the "ontology of immanence", and on the other defending himself from "famous challengers" such as Jacques Derrida -- and implicitly, by extention, Nietzsche. Davidson stations himself as the guardian of Levinas and Levinas as the guardian of seriousness against play and metaphor, claiming that one should not read him metaphorically because it would "undercut the ethical seriousness in which Levinasian discourse shrouds itself. Levinas’s ethical project would be reduced to a play of words; it would become a rhetorical strategy, a game that sets out to praise one set of metaphors over other metaphors." (372) Here, Davidson's insight is fascinating: even though he warns against reducing ethics to a rhetorical contest for domination, he still seeks to defend "seriousness" by maintaining its superior position.

Similar to many other scholars of Levinas, Davidson situates Levinas's writing in opposition to Heidegger, arraying the metaphors of Levinas's terminology against those of Heidegger. The abstract asserts "Levinas aligns metaphor with disclosure and the work of ontology, whereas he identifies his ethics with a 'revelation' of the other that is straightforward, direct, and immediate." (367) However, aren't each of these terms already a metaphor -- what are straightforwardness, directness, and immediacy other than metaphors that also refer to the manner in which one stakes out a strategic position and then move towards one's target. In any case, does Levinas really use any of this terminology in such a univocal manner? Each of these metaphors does occur in the text of Levinas, but typically in a inverted, subverter, perverter, or reverted form. For example, Davidson claims, as mentioned above, that the ethical is "shrouded", already a dark subversion of immediacy. Additionally, Levinas's orientation to the metaphorics and concepts of other philosophers is not one of simple friend/enemy opposition, but a one that is multivocal -- at turns inversive, subversive, perversive, or reversive -- often parodies of their language. For example, Levinas transforms the semantics of the Being of Heidegger's generous German "es gibt" (translated literally: "it gives") by translating it, carrying it from one language to another, sromancing it into French, substituting one set of terms for another, as the impersonal posession of an "il y a" (translated literally: "it has there"). Only one of these Levinas's four voices inverts relationships of domination in a way that can be read as polemics. We will return below to this discussion of the how Levinas employs perspectives to orient metaphors in relation to each other and himself vis-a-vis other philosophers, but for now we will simply point out that the operative conjunction between the two terms in Levinas's first title is "and" rather than "or", suggesting something composite and complexly layered rather than any outright conflict.

Most importantly, Davidson fails to appreciate how deeply committed Levinas's analysis are to metaphors, especially where he most apparently denies them. Davidson claims "In Otherwise than Being, [Levinas] goes on to insist that 'the suffering of constriction in one’s skin' describes the ethical encounter in a way that is 'better than metaphors.'" (367) Quite obviously, "constriction in one's skin" is a very vivid metaphor. However, of what exactly? For this we need to read the entire sentence written by Levinas, rather than just picking phrases that add ammunition to our argument. "Or do the being encumbered with oneself and the suffering of constriction in one’s skin, better than metaphors, follow the exact trope of an alteration of essence, which inverts, or would invert, into a recurrence in which the expulsion of self outside of itself is its substitution for the other?" (OTB 110) This entire sentence is already metaphorical or tropological, and the metaphor or trope can already be understood by considering the empirical etymologies of these terms. Davidson recognizes that "meta-phor" etymologically signifies "carrying over" but perhaps imagines only Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders or perhaps Hermes carrying a message. These images of patriarchal heroes are echoed by another, feminine semantics. An etymological dictionary explains the derivation: "metaphor ... from meta "over, across" (see meta-) + pherein 'to carry, bear,' from PIE root \*bher- (1) 'to carry,' also 'to bear children.'" Levinas often uses the language of superlative goodness such as "better" to describe the emergent creation of something new. Our same etymological dictionary explains that "trope", an apparent synonym of "metaphor", dervives from the root meaning "to turn." With this in mind, we can reread the entire sentence to understand how it narrates a story of pregnancy, gestation, childbirth, and new life, thereby implying that metaphor literally is a moment of ethical substition, of the birthing of the Self from its responsibility for the Other and for others, a fact which Davidson himself acknowledges.

BEGIN DRAFT
/====================================/

According to Chungsoo J. Lee, a scholar of Levinas, a true member of the Levinas Talumidim, Levinas always wanted to be a poet. "Levinas’s literary endeavors to write novels and poems began in earnest as early as 1943 and lasted, as far as we can tell, until 1961 when Totality and Infinity was published. Indications are that he abandoned the literary endeavors, once his philosophical project of articulating the ethical consumed his life. " (Chungsoo J. Lee "Metaphor as Levinas’s Method Where “˜the Poetic Said’ meets “˜the Prophetic Said’")

Already the question appears:  How do we introduce Chungsoo J. Lee? Is he a "Levinasian"? Certainly not. He loves Blanchot as well. ê•¸ë
 ì‹ì¸ì´ë‹¤.

What does it mean to affix a collective noun, a label or deisgnation or signification, upon such a unique individual? A collective noun as patronym, indicating one's inheritance from The Father? What does "Levinasian" mean? It is a team. For play or for war? How do they contest against the sons of other derided paternities: "Derridian" "Heideggerean" "Nietzschean"? One invisions the label "Levinasian" written black fire upon white fire, upon a sweatshirt advertising the college they are affiliated with, either as prospective, undergraduate, masters, phd, adjunct, associate, assistant, full, chair, honorary, emeritus. After they wrestle in the Collesium of Discourse, do they shake hands? Do they shake hands beforehand?


But did The Poet ever disappear fully into The Philosopher, the lover of Greek wisdom. Did not Levinas begin a marrano writing, that of a Jew hiding in plain sight, who refers so often to other thoughts and other thinkers through a reverse-epithetical *mbwakela*? Did The Poet not reemege in dialogue with Edmond Jabes: "Il n’ya de trace que dans le desert" (Book of Margins, Edmond Jabes)? 

Already sand ruins the garden of PaRaDiSe.
"Existence seems to him to be both irremediably eternal and doomed to pain: unceasingly,
alas, we shall perhaps have to upturn the stony soil in some unknown land and to push at the
heavy spade with our naked and bleeding foot." (Levinas, Existence and Existents)



/====================================/
CENTRAL TOPIC
/====================================/

Throughout his writing , Levinas shows a great deal of attention to his language. Many translators and commentators have noted this prominent fact and have drawn out the many resonances of his terms, yet we still require more genealogical explorations of his works. Once we do this, we begin to appreciate the parameters of Levinas's text, the semantic and etymological relations among them, and the functional transformation of these relationships. 

Given that Levinas's writing so often resounds "paradoxically" to many commentators, that one can so easily juxtapose two sentences even within the same text that seem to imply the opposite, we must distinguish from the start Levinas's employment of logical relations from the mode in which they are used in what he refers to as "formal logic" (Writing and Difference). First of all, negation already implies positive relationship, in which each term maintains its own specific gravity. Opposites don't cancel each other out.  For this reason, the negation of a negation is neither a tautology nor a direct reflection but rather a warped, inflected image produced by the light refracted by this gravitational excess, as positive as an electromagnetic polarity, unfied with it in a relativistic field theory. Given that apparent negations within Levinas's texts are made possible by a prior positivity, it seems inappropriate to reduce Levinas's work to a set of polemical polarities.  Most particularly, we must wonder whether Levinas would endorse any formulation of his thought as violence, such as Richard Cohen's assertion that Levinas's "battle cry would be 'Against evil, for the good!'" Do these polemics express Levinas's metaphorics?  They are perhaps reminiscent of Hegel's discussion of the struggle-unto-death, which tempts each member of a dialectical pole into the destruction of the other.   Moreover, Cohen's employment of the good/evil distinciton evokes not Levinas but rather Nietzsche's explanation of how the nobleman's distinction between "good" and "bad" degenerated into the man of *ressentiment*'s distinction between "good" and "evil."  Nietzsche's analysis already indicates that the way we create our oppositions are already determined by the way we understand the world. For Levinas, who argues that even before the other person appears as an enemy or an oppressor, he only occupies that status because of the positivity of his otherness. 

For this reason, claiming as does Cohen that "the central claim in Levinas is that the face of the other is manifested in and manifests a moral height” (EHG 183) or to reduce his thought to the maxim "The Other is the Most High" occludes many of the relativistic dynamics within Levinas's wordplay. The phrase "central claim" should already give readers pause, as the idea of centrality seems incongruous with a philosopher who discusses "decentering" or "denucleation" at length. The center of Levinas's text is often hard to pinpoint, and to identify one point as being more central often results in an image distorted by weight of that particular constellation of terms. Terms do become more prominent in Levinas's text but this is a function of frequency of usage, their periodicity of appearance, and resonances with other terms. When one reads a proclamation such as "The Other is Most High", one must immediately understand that the dimension of height is already in relation to the dimensional depth of gravitational weight and that the superlative excess of "most" both animates this dynamic and is also related to the terminology of abasement.

The maxims of Levinas, ethical proclamations such as "The Other is the Most High" and "Ethics is First philosophy", must be understood in terms of the myriad relationships they imply. As explained above the first as somehow superior to the secondary but these apparent opposites are already in a complex relationship of mutual refraction. Beyond this, ordinality does not work according the the rules of mathematical logic : zero does not follow one or one follow two or two follow three in a simple sequence, where each successive term can be deduced by adding an increment to it, but each of these numeric transitions is already a specific ethical relationship. The difference between zero and one is the birth of a subjective first person from nothingness; the difference between one and two is the dyadic relationship with a second person, the difference between two and three is the introduction of the third person into this intimacy and with him the multiplicity of generality.

The apparent signification that Levinas's terminology would obtain in a synchronic system of logic because they are always/already perverted by the historical materiality that betrays the diachronous dimension of the words themselves. A chasm obtains not merely between knowledge and the object of knowledge but also between words and their thematic meaning because the themes and meanings are already weighed down by their concrete gravity. We are born into a dialogical universe of language, a house already furnished by terms that have been used by other speakers and writers, such that each word always/already freighted down within a sedimentary accretion of associations, relations, implications and significations. What speaks through language is not, as Heidegger would have it, the pervasiveness of Being in which man exists, but the dead weight of the living history of other users of language. When I speak or write, my sentences are born into a context where words already have a meaning due to this historical materiality. Within the work of Levinas, this diachronic dimension can be read on at least three axes: (1) within the history of philosophy, (2) over the course of Levinas's publishing history, (3) along the spatial distance that separates the diachronous writing and reading of words within each synchronically-published text. Levinas displays the first type of diachrony by elocuting his argument through the technical vocabulary from past philosophers, either by straightforwardly adopting their terminology such as Plato's "kath auto" or by perverting their meanings through translation, as when he substitutes the generous "there is" of ontology implicit in Heidegger's German *es gibt* by translating it into the impersonal French of an *il y a* and transposes the semantics of giving onto the third-person public realm. When Levinas proclaims "ethics is first philosophy", Levinas invokes dialogues not only with the traditions of *protÄ“ philosophia* in Aristotle and *prima philosophia* in Descartes, but also the terminology of "priority" and the "primordial" within Heidegger.

Over the course of time, Levinas's terminology develops genealogically, with later works reappropriating and thematizing terms which had been given minor significance or mentioned in passing. Richard Cohen explains how Levinas's writings from the 40s both derive concepts from Heidegger and anticipate the thematics of Totality and Infinity by remarking "the earliest published text containing what is perhaps the nascent kernel of Levinas' thought “” hidden within the husks of Heideggerian ontology" This analysis not only commits itself to the most traditional Heideggerean language of the "hidden", but also resorts to the metaphor of the kernel and the husk, an opposition between what the center of life and the dead periphery, the acorn whose skin must dissolve in order to develop itself into the great oak tree. But the units of language are not concepts orbiting around a central abstraction but concrete metaphorics, the sedimentation of generated histories. Each writing and rewriting is a relation to death of a life that immediately becomes a new life. Whether I apprehend words in text or hear them spoken, I understand them as already dead husks woven together with dead husks in an established tapestries of signification. But behind each dead word glimmers the mystery the living speaker or writer whose past vitality produced it; even though each term of a terminology assumes a termination, its representation furnishes a shedded skin that bears witness to a life. With each succeeding generation of language and thought, a new layer of skins is added to this metaphorical sedimentation. I encounter this historical gravity not only when I engage in dialogue with another person who communicates in a general language used by others, but also when I consider the history of my own writing. I encounter even my own words as the end-products of a living effort, and expropriate them like a thief for my present productions. Whether I read writing from myself or from someone else, I encounter them as dead material that I can rearticulate into a new life, only for that expression to immediately die into a set of terms that can be usurped by a new set of writers and commentators, some of whom may be myself.

Even though a given work is published synchronically in a singular work where the terms are stuck in their constellated relationships with each other, the space between each term manifests diachronously under the keyboard of the writer and the visual processing by the reader. These intervals measure their periodic frequency and resonate them in relation to their neighboring terms. Derrida recounts these rhythms “_Totality and Infinity_ proceeds with the infinite insistence of waves on a beach: return and repetition, always, of the same wave against the same shore, in which, however, as each return recapitulates itself, it also infinitely renews and enriches itself.” (WD 312, n7) That is, Levinas’s writing, both across the span of his works and within a single text, can be understood as a process of reiterative rewriting, as rhythmically repeating harmonic motifs. Articulated through these families of metaphorics, such as those of having and doing; those of orality (vomiting, eating, breathing, laughing, speaking); those of familiarity (orphan, widow, witches, sister soul of incest and substitution, fraternity, paternity, maternity, "relationship" in general); those of dimensionality (standing, position, depth, weight, height) -- and with it erection and virility; and so on, each term is rearticulated next to a new neighboring term into a new constellation of many terms, and each of these constellations are articulated within even wider constellations.

Beyond the accretion of sedimentary layers of historical usage that weighs down the position of every term thematized into a system, the gravity of the materiality itself remains always refractory to light. It is unclear how far back we must go to trace the birth of language and whether any origin myth could capture the miracle of its generation. Following the work of Sabina Spielrein, we could imagine a midwife for language in the materiality of maternity, as evidenced by the usage of the bilabial nasal consonant "m" throughout a variety of human languages. Spielrein invites us to notice how the nursing baby, at home enjoying nourishments, its mouth both eating and kissing, respires in a cry of hunger and a call of desire, utters a vocalization, babbling repeatedly *momommomomoomo*. Even with this explanation, materiality itself is still both too dense with mystery and too open to ready for appropriation: we can only ever conceptualize this matter through a form. In this context, it can be useful to trace semantic meanings of words through their formal characteristics. Derrida indicates this question in Levinas by remarking "everything which Levinas designates as ‘formal logic’ is contested in its root. This root would not only be the root of our language, but the root of all western philosophy" (WD 91). Derrida’s hint suggests that the easiest place to begin looking at Levinas’s immanent wordplay would be in his etymological roots. For example, the Indo-European root +STA+ has a long tradition in philosophy, articulated already in the Greek term *hypoSTAsis*, which was transformed into Latin as *subSTAntia*. Whereas Heidegger considers this translation of philosophical terms to be one of the primordial stages in the forgetting of Being (BW 153), Levinas romances this root back into a French through a series of substitutions, reflecting on the "STAnce" of the me-as-self in *hypostasis*, an ethical-phenomenological event which is later rewritten as "subSTItution." Not only are "hypostasis" and "substitution" rooted in the same morpheme "sta", connoting standing, but also the prefixes are translations of the same semantic reference -- "hypo" and "sub" both connote a being underneath. Not only do we have to look at the prefixes but also the morphological qualities as a whole.

Already in his very earliest published works, Levinas displays extraordinary attention to language. In his 1932 article that introduced Heidegger to the francophone world, Levinas explains his decision to translate Heidegger's *Zuhandenheit*, the way the world already offers itself for our manipulation, as *maniabilite*, because he wishes to take "this term" -- this term through which Heidegger expresses a terminal Being-towards-Death -- "in its etymological sense" to show how it is rooted in the idea of the "hand" (19n17) Levinas remorsefully laments that his translations of Heidegger's temporalization is "obliged to resort to barbarisms" (13n5) -- already within the attempt to substitute German words for their French equivalents, one encounters barbarism, units of non-language, the vocalizations of outsiders, that perhaps echo the babbling of a baby or the grunt of an animal, but not yet a human being initiated into the *logos* of language. Levinas explicitly thematizes this importance of linguistic morphemes in his short 1949 essay in Jean Wahl's "A Short History of Existentialism", noting that what Heidegger’s “being-in-the-world,”“being-for-death,” and “being-with-Others” add to our philosophical knowledge “is that these prepositions “in”, “for”, and “˜with’ are in the root of the verb “˜to be’ (as “˜ex’ is in the root of the verb “˜to exist’)”  (Wahl 50). E&E "whether the ex is the principle root of the verb to exist."   Therefore, we should assume that Levinas is always aware of roots, prefixes, and suffixes; of the nominal, verbal, prepositional, adjectival, and adverbial parts of speech; of the active, middle, and passive voices; of the nominative, vocative, dative, genitive, ablative, accusative and even locative cases. Whether conscious or unconscious, voluntary or involuntary, this attention to morphology and etymology whether conscious or unconscious, is evident throughout Levinas's text, even before he begins to thematize language explicitly.

In his 1932 article, Levinas presents Heidegger's ontology as the radical, groundbreaking solution the central problem of modern philosophy, particularly neo-Kantianism, by demonstrating that it does not pose its questions correctly.  However, Levinas then reappropriates much of the terminology he uses in his exposition of this deprecated problematic to critique ontology after 1932, as the Heidegger committed his rebellious thinking to the rise of Hitler, and continues to employ these metaphorics prominently throughout his writing.  According to this earlier analysis, the error in idealism can be understood by interrogating its model of knowledge, in that it posits a yawning chasm between the knowing subject and the known object.  Levinas begins his critique by declaring, "The concept of the subject, understood as a substance having a specific position in the entire domain of being, presents us with difficulties of two kinds." (MHO, 12)  This statement presents us with two motifs that will resonate throughout his later works: (1) the *separate position* of subjectivity and by refraction, of the other person and the public sphere of others (2) the motif of *substance* is used in a myriad of ways.  The root "stance" often stands in for the motif of separated postitionality.  The prefix "sub" is often adjoined to movements that indicate the subversive aspect of subjectivity, most significantly when it is is rejoined to the etymological root of "stance", +STA+ to stand, in the term "substitution."  In his later work, the metaphoric of substance takes on a grammatical gravity as he thematizes the relationship between the substantive and verbal, *Le Dit* and *Le Dire*. Levinas already recognizes this linguistic relations between metaphor and morphology in his 1932 article, asking whether, after we admit the essential temporality of existence, "can that [idealist] subject be called a substance and can it have being except in a purely nominal sense?"  Whether Levinas does this deliberately or simply out of linguistic habit, Levinas introduces the recurrent metaphoric of *birth* into this exposition, "The problem of correspondence between thing and thought presupposes a free activity of thought and its isolation in relation to the object. It is precisely this presupposition which renders their harmony and even their contact problematic. 'How does the subject take leave of itself to attain the object?' is what the problem of knowledge, in the last analysis, boils down to. Its true source is thus the concept of 'subject' as elaborated by modern philosophy. The cogito presided over the subject's birth."  Already there is an ambiguity in this last line: does Levinas mean only the "birth" the subject as a concept or does it already anticipate the Levinas's later conception of separated subjectivity as an exceptional genesis, what he already refers to as an "original" aspect (MHO 12)? As is already evident in Levinas's analysis, the problematic which most concerns him is that of the ecstatic, "the very paradox of existence and of time" (MHO 22), the question of how the subject can transcend itself and how this transcendence occurs through temporality.

Often times one of Levinas's thematics will taken on a myriad of linguistic forms, transmuting from a verbality to a nominative to a suffix to a prefix, each of which accrues additional layers of semantic sedimentation as it becomes layered together with other motifs from correlated thematic families. One such example are the thematics that emerge as Levinas discovers a _having_ and a _doing_ behind _being_, the French verb "avoir" and "faire" behind "etre".  These importance of what already can be detected in the Levinas's conception of facticity in his 1932 article when he explicates Heidegger's capacity for the problematic of facticity which is so and so.  Heidegger transforms he German word *Fakt* into the term *Faktizitat* as a way of drawing attention to the way one ordinarily speaks about "the fact that" our everyday existence is a certain definite way.  In Being and Time, Heidegger argues that thes apparently inert facts are produced by a temporal dynamic in which the possibilities of the past have been projected as the current moment we find ourselves thrown into.  Levinas articlates Heidegger's analysis by writing "the fact that Dasein is riveted to its possibilities, that its "right-there" is imposed upon it." "We do not stand before the fact--we are this fact." In this exposition, Levinas correlates two motifs with facticity that accrue layers of meaning as he piles material upon them in his later work: (1) "being-riveted" and "being-imposed" in contrast to (2) a "standing before" in a stance of separation.  In Heidegger's ontology, we are in a sense trapped in our deepest being, unable to extract ourselves. In his 1934 essay "Quelques rÃ©flexions sur la philosophie de l'hitlÃ©risme" written for a Catholic journal shorty after Pope Pius had signed *concordats* with the Nazi regime, Levinas expresses this idea of "the fact", "le fait" in French, a  as the "fait accomplit": "The fait accompli, swept along by a fleeing present, forever evades man's control, but weighs heavily on his destiny. True freedom, the true beginning would require a true present, which, always at the peak of a destiny, forever recommences that destiny."  Here introduces several motifs alongside the the terminology of facts:  the weight of the facts of fate, and the idea of re-starting, of beginning anew.  Within this article, Levinas details remarks that Jewish response to this brutality of facts is through expression of radical powerlessness as "remorse", a word that will take on additional significations as Levinas develops his metaphorics of eating and other modes of orality.  In a 1935 issue of *Paix et Droit*, the journal of the *Alliance Israelite Universelle*, Levinas reflects upon the gravity of being rivited fate into a fatality, the possibility of death under Hitler: "The pathetic destiny of being Jewish becomes a fatality. One can no longer flee it. The Jew is ineluctably riveted to his Judaism. ..., Hitlerism discovers all the gravity of the fact of being Jewish"

In his 1935 article "De L'evasion" published in *Recherches Philosophiques*, Levinas rearticulates his previous metaphorics of stance and position, birth, nominal facts (*le fait*) and verbal doing (*faire*), and being riveted by gravity.  In his introduction to this essay, Jacques Rolland proposes that the task incumbent upon readers of Levinas is to "read in an early text the inscription of a future writing -- if only *en creux* (in hollow) -- of a book 'to come'" (OE 3, translation modified).  Whether Rolland himself intends his metaphor of the hollow to remind us of the womb, it seems clear that Levinas's writing proceeds "genealogically", a metaphor which John Llewlyn's reminded us can be taken in a variety of senses: (1) metaphorics of the family (2) the generation of these and other figures as ethical-phenomenological events, (3) situaton of his work as an event within an inheritance of philosophy including of Nietzsche and of the concept of generality, (4) the way his writing develops from one publication to another. (ELGE: 1)  How should we characterize the historical development of Levinas's texts?  THe metaphorics from the agricultural domain, such as the husks that conceal the kernel or the acorn that anticipates the tree, seem already committed to the concepts of potentiality and possibility in such a way that, a logic of production which Levinas compares to the operation of a machine in which "one can just as well say that the result is the final cause, or the effect, of the first movement." (TI 167)  Instead, Levinas's discussion of an "anterioir posteriority" can the way that the heritae of the genoalogical past can be appropriated by the rebirth of a present moment.  "The cause of being is thought or known by its effect as though it were posteÂ­rior to its effect. We speak lightly of the possibility of this “as though,” which is taken to indicate an illusion. But this illusion is not unfounded; it constitutes a positive event. The posteriority of the anterior””an inÂ­version logically absurd””is produced, one would say, only by memory or by thought. ... Every anteriority of the given is reducible to the instantaneity of thought and, simultaneous with it, arises in the present. "  The sequential model of history as a series of cause-and-effects in inverted in the event of the event of anterior posterioiry, in which the present momemnt assumes the past through retrospection. However the past generates the present, the generation of the present is also a separate moment unto itself, which generates its own tradition to account for its origination. When considering the trajectory of Levinas's work, we must therefore realize both that the each past work materializes a metaphorical and conceptual constellation that can furnishes raw material for new creation and also that each new creation creates a genealogy for itself retrospectively reassembling the past into a synchronic represeantation, from the perspective of its own position, in the moment of its creation.  He declares that traditional philosphy revolted against the ontological primacy of Being because 

In contrast to his 1932 philosohpical article whcih dramatically endorsed the well-deserved spell-binding popularity of Heidegger's disciplined genius, the urgency of getting out of the ontological element expressed by his 1935 article "De L'evasion" echoes the tone of "Reflectoins on the PHilosophy of Hitlerism" which implored its readers to affirm the humanity of man over the Germanic assertion of a will-to-power that exerts a force that remains attached to the one who exerts it and subordinates those subject to it, that universalizes through war and conquest.  The introductory sentence Its introductory section frames this "revolt" against the against the ontological conception of the facts, referring to it in the first sentence as the "brutal fact of being that assaults [human] freedom" and warning in the last paragraph about a the dangers of a "certain civilization, firmly established in the *fait accompli* of being and incapable of getting out of it."  Levinas draws on the literary notion of the escape the from literary world for the way that it the individual no longer belongs to himself but is swept up by the universal order, rivited by the elementary truth that there is being (*il y a l'etre*), in all its brutality and gravity.  Rather than committing to this ontological "fact of being", a genitive phrase that indicates both the fact that there being dominates and that being is manifested as facts, Levinas echoes his previous metaphorics of the idealist subject "standing before the facts" in his analysis of "the fact of self-positing" which also resembles the escape from oneself.  The event of self-positing, felt most nakedly in states like shame and nauseau, reveals that the "me", the first-person, is riveted not to the universal  of being, but to the third person of the "self", the "fact that the I [moi] is oneself[soi-mÃªme]"  The "me" who is the subject of experience is also experienced as the reflection of a *mÃªme* in the thing of a *soi* posited in the world, the "identity of the I", the entity of self-sameness, a naked materiality, "almost in the very fact of having a body, of being-there." By using the phrase "being-there", Levinas obviously means to parody Heidegger's effort to replace human subjectivity with *Dasein*, "being-there" in German. Levinas thus indicates that the location where humans exist is not determined by facts revealed the destiny of Being but rather by the establishment of the position of a nakedly material self. In affirming me as a self who maintains my own position unto myself, my self imposes "a kind of dead weight", both gravity and death, as an enchainment to my self.  

In addition to reappropriating the metaphorics attributed previously to Heidegger's facticity and idealist subjectivity in his analysis of the self-positing of the me as self, Levinas's analysis of escape both echoes Heidegger and will resound in his future metaphorics.  Levinas takes from Heidegger his redesicovery of *becoming* as "our first model of being", but his articulation of temporality as a unity of ecstasis, which Heidegger derives from the Greek *EKSTASTIS*, meaning literally outside (EK) standiing (STASIS)   "Temporality is not, prior to this, an entity which first emerges from itself; its essence is a process of temporalizing in the unity of the ecstases."  In contrast, Levinas's discussions of various modes of escape describe precisely the way I can take leave of my self, of how emergence from self takes place.  Levinas expresses this becoming from out of oneself through the prefixes "ex" and "sur", calling the need to get out of oneself a "need for excendence" which is manifested also in pleasure as "a constant surpassing of oneself." This trajectory of this evasion is charted through his usage of the prefix "re", as needs are "reborn", expressed by a "refusal", the "refusal to remain there", in the "there" where the facts are, the *Da* of Heidegger's *Dasein*, the *y* of the French *il y a* as in  *il y a de l'etre* there is being" (OE); to remain in bondage to the facts of being-there and by the "revolt" for human freedom, the same "revolt" that was announced in the first line as the philisiphical "revolt ... against the idea of being."  Although Levinas employs the metaphors of creation, rebirth, and infancy within this article, written from the despair of naked powerlessness to escape the very present possiblity of brutality, the only affirmation Levinas articluates is the being "revolted from the inside", as the embodied mailaise of nauseau that precedes vomiting, an mode of purging from oneself through one's orality. 

Levinas's post-war publications demostrate both a continuity and a discontinuity with his prievious works, extending and transforming the metaphorics he had started to develop in writings such as "De L'Evasion", deepening the terminology he was starting to develop in them.  In particular, he distances himself from Heidegger's ontology by reappropriating the tropes from the idealist tradition that Heidegger had deprecated as "inauthentic."  In his first published work, titled "Existence and Existents" in English but perhaps more faithfully translated as "From Existnce to the Existent", he explains that much of the work evolved from studies he had begun before the war and continued during his captivity in a Nazi labor camp.  Within his prison notebooks, Levinas praises socialism for focusing on the root problematic of ownersip and possession.  Alongside the verbality of the verb of existence "to be", Levinas introduces the importance of having and doing. Starting in Existents and Extents explicitly thematizes the phrase "il y a", exitence even without  describing it as an impersonal field of forces, an undifferentiated sphere of existence which compels participation.  Each word within the phrase "il y a" seems significant.  Although "il y a" is best translated into English as "there is", a literal translation of each word would be rendered as "it has there".  Within the book, he draws attention to the "il", to the impersonality of the phrase, by comparing it to similar constructions such as "it is raining" (*il pleut*) or "it is warm" (*il fait chaud*).  As mentioned above, the word there (*y*), can be understood as a parody of Heidegger's notion that human being as "Dasein", the "here" (*Da*) where being (*Sein*) unfolds as the site of disclosure , demomonstrating that anonymous being occurs as a diffuse "there" which is nowhere and everywhere.  Lastly, the word "has" (*a*) indicates that the dynamic within anonymous and undifferentiated existence is not being but having; that being-in-general is a nameless sphere of being-possessed, not of possibiity. 

The existent person emerges from this impersonal existence in a dynamic of having and locating through an event that he calls "hyposasis".  From this impersonal existence emerges the existent through an event of having a "here" for itself: "Consciousness 'has' a base, it 'has' a place. ... consciousness is here."  This having is a doing, "the work of identity".  Levinas calls this event *hypostasis*, literally "standing beneath", both reappropriating a theological synonym for "substance" and implicitly critiquing Heidegger's model of human existence as "estastic", literally "standing out of".  Levinas empahsizes the importance of this moment of hypostasis is produced "through a stance taken at a site", an event that situates a person in a particular place and a particular moment of time, the present instant. This event is also a linguistic transformation, the establishment of a substantive, a noun. Within the verbality of exitence, a subject positions himself within a stance as the substantial first-person subject of the verb "to be" within the field of anonymity. By doing so the self can effect a distance between himself and the rest of existence, thereby overcoming the anonymity of participation and allowing him to establish his mastery over the verbal flow of being.  Starting from the beginning of one's position, On can start from oness own position in being as  and can exert a virile power over it by referring it back to himself.

Levinas describes this process as a movement of "inversion", as the appropriation of the external world such that it seems to be coming from the internality of consciousness.  However, even this domination is not total: consciousness can only internalize the world in their formal aspects, but this sense of self can get lost in the materiality of sensation produced by aesthetic experience or in extreme psychological states such as insomnia.  The process of hyostasis is not only an inversive one but also a reflective one.   As before, Levinas explains that, in positing oneself as a subject, one is doubled up as in the self-sameness of identity as a thing.  He explains that "My being doubles with a havÂ­ing; I am encumbered by myself."  This mastery that is produced by establishing a stance within being occurs as a materiality, the gravity of the self that one has and to wihch to which one is riveted.  One not only exists but is occupied by the concrete fact of being oneself and the physical burden of having a body.  

Within these articles, Levinas develops the trope of rebirth that seemed only embryonic in his earlier work.  By thematizing life rather than death as the basis for the temporality of becoming, he obviously intends to parody the notion of esctatic existence of Being-Towards-Death, an idea, he had previously explianed, that allowed Heidegger to detach the idea of an action's potentiality from a goal which complete and nullify it, thereby ensuring that "power may necessarily constitute being." The self-positing of the instant hypostasis constitutes a birth for the first-subjectivity, a birth which is experienced as a *sui generis* event in which I can begin from myself.  The birthing of self in hyostasis is produced within the becoming of creaion and recreation, a process of birth death and rebirth.  He seems to suggest that reversion to the negation of the *il y a* functions as the death that punctuates the end of each instant of birth, a separation that makes possible a rebirth in a new instant. His description of death foreshadows the possibility of birth by describing the suffering that foreshadows death as a reduction to an "infantile" state.  His citations from Shakespeare's MacBeth also seem to demonstrate this relationships: once MacBeth realizes the MacDuff can murder him because he was "not of woman born," he declares that this knowledge "hath cowed my better part of man"; the fear of death not only robs Macbeth of his virility but metaphorically transforms him into a cow, something animal and feminine and possibly maternal. As Levinas transitions from his analysis of death to his description of rebirth, he describes the concept of "feminity", a difference of gender that disrupts the unity of being itself, opening up the erotic relationship that remains refractory to the power, posession and knowledge of virile subjectivity.  Here it is important to make two notes about this concept of femininty in preparation for our analysis before.  First, Levinas's description of the erotic relationship as something that fundamentally can't be reabsorbed by consciousness echoes his description of the aesthetic relationship that leads the subject into ecstasy from his inability to assimilate bare materiality into the formal structures of thought.  Secondly, Levinas describes "feminity" as a "mode of being" or as a type of alterity that is distinct both from the alterity of death and the alterity of another subjectivity, but doesn't directly ascribe this attribute to female persons.  However, the erotic relationship with the feminine does result in relationship betweeen persons, "paternity", the birth of a future subjectivity that recommences the subjectivity of the present yet is independent from it.  

Along with making birth rather than death the dynamic fundamental to temporality, Levinas similarly demonstrates that that positivity is more fundamental than negation.  Although he describes the *il y a* as a negation of any particular being, it is not an absolute absence but still the positivity of bare undifferentiated existence.  Besides this, he articulates negation several times as something produced by the positivity of the social relationship.  For example, he explains that the positivity of desire and eros, is expressed in and through negativity.  When one expresses one's friendship or love for another perosn, one also expresses that this expression is somehow inadequate to express this connection, thereby motivating the desire to further express one's friendship or love.  Within the social relationship, the negative impossibility of total communion motivates positivity of connection.  Not only friendship but the positive otherness of any relationship is what gives rise to the negativity within it.   "He is what I am not: he is the weak one whereas I am the strong one; he is the poor one, 'the widow and the orphan.'"  The manifestation of the other as someone with opposing qualities presupposes his positive manifestation in the first place.  The metaphors used in this quote seem to echo Levinas's previous analysis of hypostasis as an event which allows allows the subject to exert power over the world, and seems to anticipate his future descriptions of the Other as essentially destitute.  However, Levinas further indicates within the text that this orientation between self and other is a dynamic one that is subject to various inversions.  He continues his description of positive negation by noting that the other can also appear as the "enemy and the powerful one," indicating that even relations of animosity are founded upon a positivie relationship.  Even more interesting, Levinas explains that the structures of paternity and fraternity are necessary that "I be myself the poor one, the weak and pitiful"


Levinas fleshes out these metaphorics in his first major work Totality and Infinity.  Within the text of this work, Levinas provides us with a key that allows us some insight into the play of his metaphors.  Whereas many commentators claim that Levinas is somehow opposed to vision, a careful reading helps us to understand that Levinas’s work is profoundly perspectival.  The idea of perspecitivism is often associated with Neitzsche and so we should consider first how it works in his writing.  Nietzsche denies that there is such a thing as a neutral point of view that one can take upon in one’s speculation or that there is an inert thing-in-itself that one can approach through one’s thinking and seeing.  Instead, one is always limited in one’s comprehension of the world by the perspective in which one finds oneself implanted, and this perspective is an expression of the viewer’s wll-to-power.  Levinas’s understanding of perspectivism can already be understood by appreciating the most popular metaphor that LEvinas uses to narrate the ethical experience the “le visage de l’autre.” In translating the word “visage” as “face”, Alphonsoe Lingis unfortunately loses the sense of wordplay intended by Levinas.  The fact that the Other appears as a visage means that it is something that appears as something with the power of the self’s vision, it’s capacity to incorporate the world into its consciousness through the power of sight.  The self does so through an intentionality of a vis-à-vis that grasps the world through a perspective that refers the world back to himself.  When the self encounters the world through this intentionality, it can grasp the world according to this vis-à-vis and reduce it to a content with in his own mind.  When confronted by the visage of the other person, howevever, the subject is confronted with the fact that the other also maintains this same power to reduce the world to his consciousness with the same sovereign power which turns my own imperial understanding into the world into a dialogical relationship with them.   Levinas uses an “face” to refer to the “face de l’element”, which Lingis chooses to translate as “side” but this means that the face itself is encountered as a thing embedded in the materiality of reality as part of the substance of the world.  The face a face occurs when something from out of the world reveals that it too has the power to see back at the viewer and thus confronts him with his responsibility towards it, the work of the thematization of appropriation of the world in one’s own mentality turns into a conversation with someone else 


Levinas expresses this idea of the perspectivism repeatedly throughtout the book. Ethics is an optics, an intentionality, starting from one’s onw stance in being.  The ethical encounter only occurs starting from a separated place that  is oneself reaching out to the other.  One is already complete within one world, with one’s own comfratble interiorty and with the world as one own in a complete individual.  It is from this separated stance as a point on a graph that one reaches out and interacts with the otherperson  peers out to the only begins from a separated place where the place that the relationship place too.   Most importantly, he states “The differences between the Other and me … are due to the I-Other conjuncture, to the inevitable orientation of being ‘starting from oneself’ towards ‘the Other.’  The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work” (TI 215)   The perspective is what makes the relationship of the self towards the other is what makes possible the relationship as ethical.  The fact that he occupies his own sace and has his own interiorty appear as a difference and a revelation to me from my perspective. From the perspective of my own stance, his interiority appears as my alterity.  Levinas explores this relationship in terms of Einstein’s relativity.  Each term within the binary relationship maintains its own gravity, the weight of its own material density. According to Einstein, a bending of light occurs around objects with mass. Levinas repeatedly alludes to this as "the curvature of intersubjective space" (Totality and Infinity, 291)  Although it is possible to create a  mapping of all of the elements of space from an outside perspective but to do so would be to posit it in a public sphere where it is belongs to everyone but from my point of view it is very different  I see the other person through the curvature of intersubjective space. In using the metaphor the idea of the Einstein’s relativity of curvature.  The  idea of curvature is that mass curves the space time continuum around it, where mass is a term like matter which people don’t entirely the materiality of the object.  Warps our perspective in that direction. 

THe clue to understanding Levinas's work in Totality and Infinty and beyond is understanding the shift in perspectives that occur in the interaction between myself and the other.   Throughout Totality and Infinity, the same terms or modifications of the same terms reoccur throughout the text.  Each section presents us with a slightly altered version of the same event from a new orientation such that each of the operative semantic metaphors are reconfigured to describe the particular event that occurs.   The work investigated thus far has demonstrated a back and forth movement between various moments a transformation of each moment into its opposite.  The dynamic of birth illustrated through the metaphorics of height and weight. Hypostasis establishes sovereign self-identical subjectivity by standing its substance within the spatial stance of a location and the temporal stance of the instant, but this same motion then transforms into the the materiality of the self which weighs one down to that identity.  Place and moment are determined by the tension between the upwards pull of standing and the downwards pull of gravity.   The two apparently opposite movements, the movement of their oppositon describe together the singular event and thus in this sense are not opposites but complementary to each other.  A singular event is being described through 180 degree in perspective.  A self-identical subject both has the power to assert itsef and the burden of having to be its self to assert.  If one lives by one's reputation one both has that power to use that reputaiton to win influence but also has to always protect that reputation.  

but already human egoism leaves pure nature by virtue

depth as of the element, of the future, of the element of materiality 

But in fact the depth of the
thing can have no other meaning than that of its matter, and the revela­
tion of matter is essentially superficial.

THe work that we have covered thus far demonstrates the dynamic of a reflexive process, of the duality of each event, a dynamic that is unfolded between the polarity of a two axial directions.  As Levinas fleshes out his thinking regarding the other, he also starts to develop a better idea of the phenomenon of the Other and the dynamic of the interaction between the self and the other, he develops more clearly the idea, hints of which already seemed suggested in his previous work, this twofold dynamic is better undertood as a fourfold perspectival turning. THe word that Lvinas uses to convey the dual nature of everythin also becomes expressed in and through the idea of "equivocation" and the the prefix "ambi" in Totality and Infinity and then "ambphi" in Otherwise than Being.  The "ambivalence of nourishement" which both fills the same and withdraws form him, the ambivalence equivocation of  "which affirms its independence in the happy dependence of need."  the ambiguity of production, the ambiguity of the body and of love, concepts which will be investigated    We will illustrate this through the first model of subjectivity as the height of granted him by his virile position as subject master of his world, we take this as (1) The first of these is inversion, in which I from my lowliness look upwards towards the Other in his height.  The other-as-upwards appears in manifold guises in Levinas.  He presents this motif most manifestly when he describes the visage of the other as revealing himself "in the dimension of height."  All of the dynamics of the superlative such as his refernces to the the "superiority" or the Other, or to the motif of "transcendence", the motif that seemingly animates the distinction between the polarity announced in the title betweem totality and infinity.  The same movements can be noticed whenever Levinas uses prefixes such as "ex-" and "sur-" not only when Levinas talks about the way that the Other "exceeds" or "surpasses" the same or an "absolute surplus".  More subtlely, Levinas indicates a similar dynamic when he discusses the way in which the subject can view the past of history of "survivor", a person who lives over, here coordinatning motif of height not with the dynamics of the same and the other but instead with the metaphorics of continuous creation, of birth death and rebirth. The dynamics of the Other's height are articulated variously in Levinas's work, as the understanding of the self as exercising a virile power of mastery is ascribed to the Other. The  Other thus appears as one who can issue us a ethical command and who can appear as a master. This mastery has a myriad of aspects.  Most obviously the other as master is articulated as a schoolmaster, a teacher who comes to teach the very lesson that his existence is exterior to our own consciousness. This same motif of  mastery is inscribed into the dynamics of continuous creation with the other the one who appears as the "transcendence of the antagonist" who threatens me with death "as a tyranny", putting an end to my life in the moment and inversely as the one who utters the command "thou shalt not kill"
(2)  The second turning, subversion, occurs as the Other looks down at us.   This dynamic is most evident through the process of the formation of the subject, which is already a word that means being thrown under .  The sfelf is produced in and through its relationship relative to a surrouding environment produced by the elemental materiality of the other and others. The other's connection with matter which is the sphere of lowness Levinas's term "hypostasis" explored in the 40s already indicates this dynamic of standing-underneath as does the terminology of "substituion" employed most prominently in Otherwise than Being. Within Totality and Infinity, this language is used most prominently in Levinas's discussion of the emergence of the subject from the when the self  finds itself in a position of lowness relative to the environment in "a wave that engulfs and submerges." This explanation will be more clear as we understand better how materiality emerges in the process of the life cycle.   (3) Perversion occurs when I look down at the Other from my height.  This occurs when I view the other in the same state of being overwhelmed by its materiality, in misery or destitution, in nakedness of the fact, the other in subjected to the materiality of his existence, poor and naked and hungry.  From my height I percieve the material lowness of the other's material condition as an "appeal to my powers",  speaking to me as a sovereing subject who has the capacity to give to him.  (4) Reversion is when the Other looks up at the Other from his lowness.  This refers to another moment of the subject formation.  It refers back to the dynamic of the typical idea of the sovereign subjectivity, but the world is not simply constructed by mute objects but by the Other and the dead works of the other which constitute materiality, so that the self-assertion of virile subject is already cast as the "imperialism of the same" seizing the world as my own and taking it for myself as my own possession is understood as the "imperialism of the same".  The relationships in this perspective are most frequently announced with the refix "re".  The creation of the subject in the moment at the location is not just a birth but a rebirth, already constituted by a prior past of an Other who is the self as well as other others.  The takes the world as if it were representations, presentations related to the self .  "Their alterity is thereby reabsorbed into my own identity as a thinker or a possessor."  Ia longing for return a remembering of the past in the construction of memeory It is the very reversion of this alter­ation.  This reversion of the alterity of the world to self-identifica­tion must be taken seriously.  Within the text of Totality and Infinity, much of these dynamics of the apriority of the Other are there but they are not entirely clear.  The great innovation of Otherwise than Being is to enrich these metaphorics that are already within Totality and Infintiy and clarifying the presence of the Other.  

mention the "widow" and the "orphan"

These turning occur within the the drama of creation and recreation.  Levinas has self-conciosunsly been using the motif birth throughtout his work, first mentioning it even in his work in the 30s perhaps unconsciously but then explicitly referes to it in the 40s with reference to Descartes, Malebranche and Bergson.  In Totatliyt and Infinity, he explores this idea throughout, exploring the process of becoming through a narration of genesis, an engendering of generations. Levinas refers throughout this work to the motifs of birth and death and each section of the work, with the exception of the the introductory section on "Metaphysics and Transcendence" and the "Conclusoins" at the end, illustrates an event in the story of this process.  THe interiority of the subject is founded upon the importance of the life and the death of the subject outside of the porcess of universal history, where the process of life is described as the events that constitute the interior life of interioiry and its interactions with the exteriority of the other framed by the interval of "dead time" that separate each of these instants.  THe subject is produced in what Levinas refers repeatedly as a "latent birth".  It is something that has been born but has this conditions of its birth have been forgotten such that the self considers itself to be the master and soveriegn in existence and can retrospectively consider its own past in an at of remembrace and representation.  Birthing occurs within the context of what Levinas a sphere which Levinas calls "la nourissement", the transnutation of the same, taking the material element of the same and converting it into the substance of its own interioirty.   Lingis translates this word as "nourishment" but in French translates equally as "nursing".  The other whcih appears as the element that the one consitutes as one's own subjstance is the materiality of maternity, the mother's milk that feeds the child and satifsies its life.  The alterity of the other's "visage" is implicit in his description of the element as the *le face*, the side of the element turned to oenself  This birth is produced as an upwards stance, an erection of a human body raised upwards committed in the direciton of height but the  fact of the body where freedom discovers itself
murderous in its very exercise
But this dependency on the elemental materiality is felt in a body naked and indigent and needy.  Gives a new explanation of this same phenomenon by descriving the dwelling.  The dwelling can be taken  
"Enjoyment is the very production of a being that is born, that breaks the
tranquil eternity of its seminal or uterine existence to enclose itself in a
person, who in living from the world lives at home with itself"  The dwelling both reiterates the previous analysis of birth and constitutes a new event in the development of maturation.  THe house provides a space that the self can become itself and thus position itself a location where it can stand up in in order to position itself as subject and recognize the rest of the world in a reduction as its its represetantaion.  THis sheltering requires a femnine face to welcome it.  THe intercession of the feminine can be taken in two senses: first of all, it hearkens back to the idea of the womb as that which sustains the foetus throughout its development but also an event of marriage both a childhood home in which one is nurtured and also the house that one takes when one is event of marriage, as the spanish "se casar" is literally to marry.  It is the event of "familiarity" a sense in which there is a development of a family and relationships between family.  Once the one is married or has a house to be raised within it, I can then engage in labor or possession, that is one can go out into the world and get a job and create things that relate to me as property . 

THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO OTB
 When we discuss the property we then get into the relationship of having that we saw before in the works of the 40s.  The dynamic of the labor is one of taking from the element and creating it as a set of sustainable things that I can have as my own possession.  THe efforts of the possession and having are articulated as the process of incorporation, of making oneself a body.  He explores this through the metaphor of eating.  One eats the element and through the eating incorporates the substance of the world as one's own body.  This eating is not a simple pacific relationship with the element though.  it is a nourishment but also the conversion of the other into the same is already a type of violence.   He indicates this subtlely in saying that need is a hunger in which one is "capable of killing for a crust of bread", Possession masters the future of the element by suspending it, making it lose its independent being, posits it as the durable substance over which the self can exercise an ownership and a mastery.  
the corporeal being of man— nakedness and indig­
ence, exposed to the anonymous exteriority of heat and cold but recollect­
ing in the interiority of being at home with oneself, and hence labor
and possession. THe home opens one to an economic realm in whihc one encounters the world as things but these are things that are anonyomous and dtached from the erson who created them.  Theus the thing which presents itself is already a dead thing, the product of dead labor. The person who created them is absented form them.  They testify to their createion and their creator but only as traces of their existence, congealed as parts of the thing that creted them, like the skin shed by a snake testifies to the life of the snake. The product I use is the result of the labor of millions of people but when it comes to me as I perceive it as a use-value as something that is already oriented towards my own consumption and satisfaction withut necessarily being aware of the people whose effeorts and labor and suffering, whose lifeforce and whose death were instrumental in its creation.  The metaphorics of death, already introduced from the beginning and foreshowed since the description of birht, come out most seriously in the discussion on commerce.  What is the subject of commerce.  It is the goods that we exchange. They testify to death and to the intemporality.  We understand them as already for us as survivors, which is already a wordplay off of in french as one who lives (vivre) on top of, whose height of self-sovereign subjectivity allwows them to grasp the world as materiality as its own.  THe world appears as a neutral set of things and properties for one, and in this place it is used the very same terms that Levinas uses for the *il y a* or the sphere of generality is the same as the It is the negativity of the personality in which things appear as not attached to anyone and thus avialable in principle to anybody.   THe emergence of this anonymous sphere of generalized commodities is what allows for the establishment of both myself and the other as separated entities and allows us to maintian a distance from the world in general. It is a negtation of the independence of the world.   yet this is also a product of their death, Death is not a fact of nature or the adventure of an isolated individual but already presuppose a relationship of sociality. Levinas explores the end of life by using the metaphorics of murder and suicide.  
I can wish to kill only an existent absolutely inde­
pendent, which exceeds my powers infinitely, and therefore does not op­
pose them but paralyzes the very power of power. The Other is the sole
being I can wish to kill.  Precisely after this is when Levinas announces the doctrine that one often thinks of as the summary of his thought "Thou shalt not kill"  is already an ambivalent statement, and we have to apprehend that the word "not" here is used in a technical sense in which negation is not complete denial or non-existence but already the affirmation of a positive event.   the other reamins beyond my murder because his reactions are alays unforeseeable and because there is always a future beyond my present moment that is singaled in the present moment but within the present moment itself there is always the activity of murder itself, one is "capable of killing for a crust of bread". Violence can aim only at a face. The content of one's enjoyment is refering to the fact that one is alwasy murdering in everday consumption.  From the other comes a counter mobement of murder  something that paralyses me just in the same way that I suspend the anonymity of the elemental materiality.  Labor, in which it is exerted, is visibly
inserted in the things, but the will forthwith absents itself from them,
since works take on the anonymity of merchandise, an anonymity into
which, as a wage-earner, the worker himself may disappear.
T he other can dispossess me of my work, take it
or buy it, and thus direct my very behavior; I am exposed to instiga­
tion.   the heritage of
dead wills.

The others confront me in the face of the Other meaning that when I see someone I see him as this materiality.  His identity is constituted asa  thing which referes not just to himself but to the generality of idenitty itself which refers to the social world in which identity is creation which is a product of others.  My identity as a "Jew" is not mine alone but already a reference to the entire religion of other jews.  not completely unique to them.  I see them as someone else.  WE ask who as what.  Reduction of someone of an identity. 
"T o be sure, most of the time the who is a what. The answer presents itself as a quiddity; it refers to a system of relations. "  I encounter this other with a "welcome" thus I become the feminine presence that makes possible the manitestation of the other.  and also I become the product of his teaching which effectuates a birthing of me, an incessesant reception of teaching, of his masteery that is the preconditon for my owne birth .  THe mortality of the self is not simply the death althogether but already the "not yet" of the future, in this means that saying that one has a future in which one can reaspond to the other.  One is subjected to murder just as one is thorugh to enjoyment, the body and its materiality  This status of the will is the body

M urder, at the origin of death, reveals a

threatens as a tyranny, as though proceeding from a foreign will

The death of the self occurs as a birth as mentioned before in the future, threatens from up ahead in an uknowable and ungraspable future.  The erotic relaitonship is that which one goes through in the transition to birth.  The death occurs as "le petit mort", in the eroitc relationship.  THe erotic relationship is the most intense expression of the eroticism that leads to rebirth is the expression outfright of the expereince of ambivalence and the dual nature of everything.  In here there is a new character introducd into the mixed "Love as a relation with the O ther can be reduced to this fundamental
immanence, be divested of all transcendence, seek but a connatural being,
a sister soul, present itself as incest."  A sister soul is produced.  The political fraternity as facing each other in subject.  The sister sould is reflection of the feminine alterity already present in the home and in the uterine dependencey.  And it is the recitation of all the motifs that we have seen thus far combined at their most paradoxical reversals.  More interesting still it betrays the underlying problematic of the reversal, in that the eroticism is not just encouter with the feminine sister soul but the process in which I myself am effeminated, becoming maternal and productive myself  .   an intensification of metaphors such as "ultramateriality".

 It tells a story of life stage development, from birth through mature home ownership, through old age, through sex and death, to rebirth.  Levinas employs the terminology of birth repeatedly to describe a variety of interconnected phenomenological events such as the “latent birth” of the subject (OTB 139), the “birth of love” in Eros (TI 277), and the “birth of thought, consciousness, justice, and philosophy … of a meaning” through the third party (OTB 128).  In the life-stage narrative of Totality and Infinity, the event of birth is explored through the opening section on enjoyment, “the very production of a being that is born, that breaks the tranquil eternity of its seminal or uterine existence to enclose itself in a person” (TI 147).[16]  The motifs Levinas employs in this original section are connected to other metaphorical networks throughout his work.  In addition to being a member of the biblical triad of destitution along with the stranger and the widow (TI 77), the “orphan” describes a particular aspect of this production of being, “an orphan by birth” (OTB 105).  This orphan event occurs because the child is born separated, after the erotic death of the mother and the father, “having absolved oneself from relations” (TI 195), separated from all relatives, constantly menaced by neediness.  One reversal of this concept--this conception--of the orphan is the concept of the work, which Levinas describes as “always in a certain sense an abortive action” (TI 228, my italics), a doubling of birth and death.

As mentioned above, this continuous GENesis must be understood as a creative enGENdering, and thus gender informs all phenomenological matters.  As with the family, gender is essential for overcoming a unifying totality.  Levinas asserts, “The difference between the sexes is a formal structure, but one that carves up reality in another sense and conditions the very possibility of reality as multiple, against the unity of being proclaimed by Parmenides” (TO 44).  For Levinas, gender is essential for breaking with “the neuter (the sole gender formal logic knows)” (TI 256), and with the neutral, Heideggerean Being that Blanchot criticizes (TI 298).  Unlike German and English which do have neuter cases, the French language gives all proper nouns a masculine or feminine gender.  For example, “le sujet” is masculine in French, just as human subjectivity and political citizenship have traditionally been figured as masculine by male philosophers.

In addition to these morphological considerations, we must attend to the semantic connections between various etymological networks. For example, words rooted in “STA” (e.g. stand), must be correlated with other etymological networks connoting position and proximity, as well as those connoting height and depth. The very word “origin” comes from <em>oriri,</em> to rise: for Levinas, man has “overcome” the “destitution” of his “animal needs” (<em>TI</em> 116”“17) to become <em>homo erectus,</em> already erect and masterful and virile.

BEING AND HAVING
BEING AND DOING
To clarify the connection we have caught sight of between being and action when we found a "one has to be" at the bottom of the "one has to do," and when the beginning of an action seemed to contain the fundamental structure of existence doubling up into being and having and succumbing under the burden of its having, we have to go further in the analysis of fatigue.

hypostasis: having being doing
19 hypostasis having and being
If the present is thus constituted by the taking charge of the present, if the time-lag of fatigue creates the interval in which the event of the present can occur, and if this event is equivalent to the upsurge of an existent for which to be means to take up being, the existence of an existent is by essence an activity. An existent must be in act, even when it is inactive.

it is the act of positing oneself on ground, it is rest inasmuch as rest is not a pure negation but this very tension of a position, the bringing about of a here. 

The fundamental activity of rest, foundation, conditioning, thus appears to be the
very relationship with being, the upsurge of an existent into existence, a hypostasis. This
entire essay intends only to draw out the implications of this fundamental situation.

FACT WORLD GIVEN -- who gives?
And the fact of being given is the world.



In this book, Levinas formally thematizes the phrase "il y a" which he will refer to throughout his later works as an understood concept. It is important to view this as a step in his understanding of translation of Heidegger. In the Martin Heidegger and Ontology tranaslation was viewed as a self-conscious trying to preserve the etymological and ontological roots of Heidegger's work, but also apologizing for the barbarism -- the density of language, that prevented perfect substitution or recognized the unintelligibility of the translation, incomprehensibility within the heart of language itself. However, the translation of "es gibt" as "il y a" seems a more radical posture, a deliberate parody of Heidegger, an ironic refashionng, both completely faithful but also a perversion. , Judaism contains within it a “heretic hermeneutic [that] can be part of tradition while simultaneously rebelling against it” (201). Levinas himself speaks of this in later texts. "There is - impersonally - like it is raining or it is night? None of the generosity which the German term (es giht) is said to contain revealed itself between 1933 and 1945.


The translation can already be identified to see its parodic function. Both the French "il y a" and "es gibt" are everyday phrases that commonly are translated as "there is". Translated literally they have a different connotation of the meaning. German "es gibt" as "it gives" connotation of giving that the idea that the given of our situation is something that occurs within the context of our relationship to Being, that we are given the Being, the possiblitites which we are delivered unto are things that define our very being. Levinas will expand upon the metaphorics of giving in his later work to show that it is in the political realm of alienated labor and expropriated possessions that is characteristic of the political or the third.
Already in EE, Levinas confronts the being as not a generosity but a generality and a genus, a question of birth.  
Literaly french is an "it has there". The thematics of having are and the placement of an there an "y". Positionality and the having are defined in reference to the "it", one is bound to it already and the place of it . No independent stance outside of it. Already its possession and domination.  


 Levinas transforms the semantics of the Being of Heidegger's generous German "es gibt" (translated literally: "it gives") by translating it, carrying it from one language to another, sromancing it into French, substituting one set of terms for another, as the impersonal posession of an "il y a" (translated literally: "it has there").
Not just the supplanting of the giving with an impersonal having but also the dynamics of doing and of facts.  
 with the pure fact that there is Being, the nakedness of this bare
fact.


positionality and hte having. The maintenance of a position in the being. It has there. How is the htere maintianed in the "it has there" of the "il y a". How does it escape the being had as a there within being
Levinas introduces thhe idea of hypostasis. A personal place and space . Here Levinas starts with the idea of "stance" of maintaining a position in being. THe stance of the instant analyze the notion of the present and of position, in which a
being, a subject, an existent, arises in impersonal Being, though a hypostasis. Note here that the metaphorics of "arising" are here definitive of the subject. also described as an "upsurge" This activity of
inactivity is not a paradox; it is the act of positing oneself on ground, it is rest inasmuch
as rest is not a pure negation but this very tension of a position, the bringing about of a
here. The fundamental activity of rest, foundation, conditioning, thus appears to be the
very relationship with being, the upsurge of an existent into existence, a hypostasis.
It is positionality which makes possible the relationship of the self to the given, to the generosity of the world. and to give themself  



. Desire as a relationship with the world involves both a distance between me and the desirable, and consequently a time ahead of me, and also a possession of the desirable which is prior to the desire. This position of the desirable, before and after the desire, is the fact that it is given. And the fact of being given is the world.


topic: subversive/perversive/inversive/reversive reading
========================================================
the materiality of language itself already protests to be hheard.  
our subversive and radical reading will attempt to reveal the immanent roots, the poetic dimension within Levinas’s hyperbolic, transcendental prose.[7] Such a reading will show that, although Levinas deliberately uses filial tropes throughout his work, this would only constitute a “problem” if it were read in a hermeneutically “straight” manner. Beneath the apparent hetero-normative veneer of Levinas’s prose lurk traces of queerness. The ethical relationship is directed not simply from masculine Self to feminine Other, but is everywhere perverted.
Rather than focusing exclusively on the obvious rhetorical gestures Levinas makes, a radical reading must look carefully at the immanent play of tropes within his work. Levinas’s writing can only be understood through a close investigation of the interconnections and transformation between clusters of metaphors. Derrida slyly indicates this problem when he explains that “everything which Levinas designates as’formal logic’ is contested in its root. This root would not only be the root of our language, but the root of all western philosophy” (<em>WD</em> 91).

======================================
negation
39 opposition
y. Consciousness, in its opposition to the unconscious, is not constituted by the
opposition, but by this proximity, this communication with its contrary:

Hegel Phenomenology of Spirit 187.   The presentation of itself, however, as the pure abstrae-tion of self-consciousness consists in showing itself as the pure negation of its objective mode, or in showing that it is not attached to any specific existence, not to the individuality common to existence as such, that it is not attached to life. This presentation is a twofold action : action on the part of the other, and action on its own part. In so far as it is the action of the other, each seeks the death of the other. But in doing so, the second kind of action, action on its own part, is also involved ; for the former involves the staking of its own life. Thus the relation of the two self-conscious individuals is such that they prove themselves and each other through a life-and-death struggle. They must engage in this struggle, for they must raise their certainty of being for themselves to truth, both in the case of the other and in their own case. And it is only through staking one’s life that freedom is won; only thus is it proved that for selfconsciousness, its essential being is not [just] being, not the immediate form in which it appears, not its submergence in the expanse of life, but rather that there is nothing present in it which could not be regarded as a vanishing moment, that it is only pure beingfor-self The individual who has not risked his life may well be recognized as a person, but he has not attained to the truth of this recognition as an independent selfconsciousness. Similarly, just as each stakes his own life, so each must seek the other’s death, for it values the other no more than itself; its essential being is present to it in the form of an “˜other’, it is outside of itself and must rid itself of its self-externality. The other is an immediate consciousness entangled in a variety of relationships, and it must regard its otherness as a pure being-for-self or as an absolute negation.


Let us trace here the basics of reflection and negation .  
Not being towards death but a being-towards-life

y. Consciousness, in its opposition to the unconscious, is not constituted by the
opposition, but by this proximity, this communication with its contrary:


positivity behind negativity
To shake hands with a friend is to express one's friendship for him, but it is to
convey that friendship as something inexpressible, and indeed as something unfulfilled, a
permanent desire. The very positivity of love lies in its negativity. The burning bush that feeds the
flames is not consumed.


Without properly articulating what the terms "good" and "evil" mean in Levinas's writing, Cohen expresses this contrast with astonishing violence, arguing that Levinas's "battle cry would be'Against evil, for the good!'" (<em>EEP</em> 104) Such a polemical cry could not possibly come from Levinas, but rather from Nietzsche's man of <em>ressentiment.</em>

Hegel 187


The basic axioms of logic are:
(1) Negation: A != NOT-A
(2) Reflection: A := NOT-(NOT-A)

Levinas draws attention to the fact that each term already exists in a relationship -- "related" as "families" to each other as "fraternal" concepts. Each term within the binary relationship maintains its own gravity, the weight of its own material density. According to Einstein, a bending of light occurs around objects with mass. Levinas repeatedly alludes to this as "the curvature of intersubjective space" (Totality and Infinity, 291)

Thus the axioms of Levinas's logic are
(1) Positivity: A != PLUS-A
(2) Refraction/Non-Reflection: A != PLUS-(PLUS-A)

topic: perspectivism
====================
What animates Levinas’s corpus is that each new analysis gives us a new perspective on this singular situation. I would in fact argue that the notion of “perspectivism” is as important for understanding Levinas’s work as it is for Nietzsche’s.[10] Although the dialogical relation of speech surmounts the theoretical stance of vision, Levinas still retains the notion of perspective, explaining that “ethics itself is an optics” (<em>TI</em> 23). He does not abandon visuality, but instead warps it, perverts it.[11] “The differences between the Other and me are due to the I-Other conjuncture, to the inevitable <em>orientation</em> of being’starting from oneself’ towards’the Other.’ The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work” (<em>TI</em> 215).[12]

It does not purely and simply exist. Its movement of existence which might
be pure and straightforward is bent and caught up in itself, showing that the verb to be is
a reflexive verb: it is not just that one is, one is oneself [on s'est].


Once we understand the way that Levinas’s perspectives bend, we can begin to reflect upon the metaphorical networks that illuminate his work. Most frequently, Levinas indicates the double-sidedness of a phenomenological event by reversing a perspective. For example, to claim only that the Other is situated in an elevated state as the “Most High” is to miss the full dynamic mobilization of this metaphor. The “height” of the other is the hyperbolic correlate and the perspectival reversal of the “the upsurge of the self (<em>le surgisment de soi</em>) One becomes a subject of being [by] an exaltation, an’above being’â
 (<em>TI</em> 119, <em>TeI</em> 123). Keeping in mind that the French root “<em>sur</em>“ means “over,” we can then understand why Levinas insists that we experience history as a “SURvivor” (<em>TI</em> 57), why infinity “SURpasses itself” (<em>TI</em> 103), and why fecund temporality is a “reSURrection” (<em>TI</em> 56). Through a different perspectival reversal, this height of separation can also be expressed as “an abyss within enjoyment itself” (<em>TI</em> 141), which becomes articulated as my “hypostasis” (<em>TO</em> 54”“55) and the Other’s “destitution” (<em>TI</em> 78).

genesis

The instant in which existence is both born and dies is followed by an
instant in which existence is born, which inherits its legacy.

The theory of continuous creation in Descartes and Malebranche refers, on the
phenomenal level, to the incapacity of an instant to join up itself with the following
instant

. Each instant is a beginning, a birth.

it remains that of itself an instant is a relationship, a conquest,
although this relationship does not refer to any future or past, nor to any being or event
situated in that past or future. An instant qua beginning and birth is a relationship sui
generis, a relationship with and initiation into Being.


But the notion of the struggle for existence is not enough to grasp the relationship of an
existent with its existence as deeply as we would like. When taken at the level of the time
of the economic order, as it ordinarily is envisaged, it appears as a struggle for a future, as
the care that a being takes for its endurance and conservation. It is the struggle of an
already existent being for the prolongation of its existence. It is not a continual birth,
understood as a distinct operation by which an existent takes over its existence, apart
from what it may do to conserve it. To see the truth of this operation, let us ignore all
attitudes toward existence which arise from reflection, attitudes by which an already
constituted existence turns back over itself. The attitudes involved in meditation on the
"meaning of life," pessimism or optimism, suicide or love of life, however deeply they
may be bound up with the operation by which a being is born into existence, take place
over and beyond that birth.


peculiar relationship one has
with existence “” birth as a relationship “” must not be confused with a judgment.




There is a sense in which <em>Totality and Infinity</em> may be read as if were the first Book of Moses, Genesis or ×‘Ö¼
, [15] the story of the engendering of generations. It tells a story of life stage development, from birth through mature home ownership, through old age, through sex and death, to rebirth. Levinas employs the terminology of birth repeatedly to describe a variety of interconnected phenomenological events such as the “latent birth” of the subject (<em>OTB</em> 139), the “birth of love” in Eros (<em>TI</em> 277), and the “birth of thought, consciousness, justice, and philosophy of a meaning” through the third party (<em>OTB</em> 128).

In the life-stage narrative of <em>Totality and Infinity</em>, the event of birth is explored through the opening section on enjoyment, “the very production of a being that is born, that breaks the tranquil eternity of its seminal or uterine existence to enclose itself in a person” (<em>TI</em> 147).[16] The motifs Levinas employs in this original section are connected to other metaphorical networks throughout his work. In addition to being a member of the biblical triad of destitution along with the stranger and the widow (<em>TI</em> 77), the “orphan” describes a particular aspect of this production of being, “an orphan by birth” (<em>OTB</em> 105). This orphan event occurs because the child is born separated, after the erotic death of the mother and the father, “having absolved oneself from relations” (<em>TI</em> 195), separated from all relatives, constantly menaced by neediness. One reversal of this concept--this conception--of the orphan is the concept of the work, which Levinas describes as “always in a certain sense an <em>abortive</em> action” (<em>TI</em> 228, my italics), a doubling of birth and death.

As mentioned above, this continuous GENesis must be understood as a creative enGENdering, and thus gender informs all phenomenological matters. As with the family, gender is essential for overcoming a unifying totality. Levinas asserts, “The difference between the sexes is a formal structure, but one that carves up reality in another sense and conditions the very possibility of reality as multiple, against the unity of being proclaimed by Parmenides” (<em>TO</em> 44). For Levinas, gender is essential for breaking with “the neuter (the sole gender formal logic knows)” (<em>TI</em> 256), and with the neutral, Heideggerean Being that Blanchot criticizes (<em>TI</em> 298). Unlike German and English which do have neuter cases, the French language gives all proper nouns a masculine or feminine gender. For example, “<em>le sujet</em>“ is masculine in French, just as human subjectivity and political citizenship have traditionally been figured as masculine by male philosophers.


Since the inauguration of modern French feminism in Simone DeBeauvoir’s <em>The Second Sex,</em> Emmanuel Levinas has been criticized for the way his thought employs gendered, familial tropes. In response, this paper argues that, although this does constitute a very real and urgent <em>problematic</em> in Levinas’s thought, it only becomes a <em>problem</em> when his writing is read in a hermeneutically “straight” manner. Beneath the apparent hetero-normative veneer of Levinas’s prose lurk traces of queerness. By closely tracing the motifs that Levinas correlates with gender, this paper will illustrate how, at each instant in the ethical relationship, the Self is always transforming between masculine- and feminine-gendered performances for a feminine- or masculine-gendered Other. Rather than embodying a conservative and essentialist view of sexuality, Levinas articulates an existential performative perversity.[See my paper Levinas Peverter)Levinas-Perverter]

Now that we have a preliminary understanding of Levinas’s particular usage of tropes, we can better investigate why he seems so attached to what Derrida calls “the family schema” (<em>PF</em> viii). Already a doubling reversal is expressed through this trope: the “familiar” already hyperbolically inverts the Other’s existence as an alien, as “not resting on any prior kinship” (<em>TI</em> 34). For Levinas, the notion of “family” connotes the way an individuated, separated multiplicity of entities are already related to each other, through social temporalities and moral obligations that preexist the political order. Contrasting his analysis with a philosophical tradition stretching from Plato to Hegel, he asserts “the family does not only result from a rational arrangement of animality; it does not simply mark a step towards the anonymous universality of the State. It identifies itself outside of the State, even if the State reserves a framework for it” (<em>TI</em> 306).

Filiality does not emerge simply as a social construction, but rather constitutes a responsibility for other human beings independently of unifying structures such as Hegelian Spirit or Heideggerean Being. Writing from within the phenomenological tradition, Levinas most pointedly questions the reductive universalization of Husserl’s <em>genus</em> (<em>TI</em> 194”“96), a term derived from the Indo-European GEN, signifying “birth.”[13] For Levinas, the generative family demonstrates that, rather than merely issuing from an origin, existence is a continuous creation: “the discontinuity of Cartesian time, which requires a continuous creation, indicates the very dispersion and plurality of created being” (<em>TI</em> 58).[14]

Now that we have begun to understand what the theme of gender signifies for Levinas, we can begin to consider the meaning of the Feminine. Perversely, I am going to attempt to give this Feminine a proper name, a biblical name. It is not one of the feminine names Levinas gives in “Judaism and the Feminine” such as Miriam or Tamar or Leah (<em>DF</em> 31), but it is perhaps the most frequently used name in the bible. Before I produce this woman before you, let me begin by suggesting that, in his early work, Levinas states that “all philosophy is perhaps a meditation on Shakespeare” (<em>TO</em> 72). In contrast to the tragic Greek heroes who confront death as part of their fate and destiny in a Heideggerean Being-towards-Death, Levinas discusses man’s confrontation with death through the character of Macbeth. Macbeth not only wishes that the world would die along with him, “he wishes that the nothingness of death be a void as total as that which would have reigned had the world <em>never been created</em>“ (<em>TI</em> 231, my italics). Two important things must be said about this dramatic person who opposes origination. First of all, he is warned by the witches--the Moirae, the Fates--that his death will come at the hands of an Other who is “not of woman born,” his friend MacDuff. Second, in order to understand who Macbeth himself is, we must understand that “Mac” is a common Gaelic prefix for “son of.” “
MacBeth” is quite an unusual name because generally these names are patronymic, such as “Johnson” for the son of John or “MacDonald” for the son of Donald, but in this case it would appear that this familiar character is the son of a woman named “Beth.”

There are multiple reasons why it is useful to express the Feminine as being named “Beth.” In Hebrew, “Beth” signifies not only a proper name, but also the second letter of the alphabet, ×‘Ö¼. It can function as a locative prefix indicating “inside,” perhaps even “interiority.” Although ×‘Ö¼ is the second letter of the alphabet, it is the first letter of creation, the first letter in the first word of the first parshah of the first book of Torah: <strong>×‘Ö¼
</strong>×¨Öµ
, “In the beginning.” Already in this very word, the root ×¨Ö¹
--which can be translated as “head” or “first” or even “á
-- is preceded by the secondary letter ×‘Ö¼. “
Beth” in Hebrew signifies not only the letter ×‘Ö¼, but also the word ×‘Ö¼
, which translates as “house,” even as “dwelling.” For this reason, “Beth” is the most frequently used feminine name in the Bible, as a locative signifier in place names such as “Bethel” and “Beth Israel.” Again, the first word of Torah, <strong>×‘Ö¼
</strong>×¨Öµ
<strong>Ö´</strong><strong>×™×ª</strong>, houses the primary ×¨Ö¹
 within the ×‘Ö¼
.

In addition to these various linguistic meanings, ×‘Ö¼ also has a mathematical signification: Because Hebrew uses letters to represent numbers, ×‘Ö¼ also signifies the number 2. One of the motifs that most pervasively underlies the Levinas’s work is the question of number. Like many philosophers before him, Levinas confronts a perennial mathematical problem: when we think of a certain quantity of things, we generally conceive of a singularity rather than a multiplicity. That is, when we contemplate “twenty dogs,” we typically consider this as a single group of twenty rather than thinking the twenty-ness of the twenty itself. Levinas expresses this problem through meditations on plurality and multiplicity “The plural is given to a number. Unity alone is ontologically privileged. Multiple is, but in synthesis is no more” (<em>TI</em> 274).

At the risk of implicating Emmanuel Levinas in paganism or kabbalah, let me state that there is something almost Pythagorean in his thought, in the sense that numbers are not used merely for counting, but themselves describe certain configurations of Being. A thorough investigation will require additional study, but we can begin to account for his numbers here.

Levinas thinks the “negative” in tension with the skeptical negations of Descartes (<em>TI</em> 92”“93), the dialectical negation of Hegel’s <em>Aufhebung</em> (<em>TI</em> 305), and the negation of <em>Dasein</em>“˜s death (<em>TI</em> 56). He invokes the terrible quality of the negative as the <em>il y a</em>, that which exists after the negation of all particular, positive entities (<em>TI</em> 190, cf. <em>EE</em> 57”“64). On the other hand, I establish my own positive, separated selfhood by negating alterity through labor and integrating it back into the Same (<em>TI</em> 40”“41). Against this murderous violence that “proceeds from unlimited negation” (<em>TI</em> 225), the Other can “sovereignly say no” (<em>TI</em> 199). Negation occurs not only in this masculine confrontation, but also through the feminine “less than nothing” (<em>TI</em> 258) encountered in Eros which has “reference --be it negative--to the social” (<em>TI</em> 262).

Closely related to but distinct from the negative is the zero. Before the positive singularity of selfhood, zero occurs as anarchy (<em>OTB</em> 99), the zero point (<em>TI</em> 159), the null site (<em>OTB</em> 10), creation <em>ex nihilo</em> (<em>TI</em> 104)<em>,</em> freedom originally null (<em>TI</em> 224)<em>.</em> More generally, zero describes a boundary surrounding positive existence as the elemental menace of nowhere (<em>TI</em> 141), the void of illumination (<em>TI</em> 189), the nothingness of the future (<em>TI</em> 146), and the “no man’s land.”[17] Relationships through the zero occur as the erotic caress “seizing upon nothing” (<em>TI</em> 257), the ethical “exteriority coming from nothingness” (<em>TI</em> 293), substituting oneself in a “null place” (<em>OTB</em> 116), and fraternity as “a complicity for nothing” (<em>OTB</em> 150).

Now that we have begun to work through the negative and the zero, we can think through the positive, in which we can already hear spatial “position,” cognitive “positing,” and philosophical “positivism.” The social and political are produced as a “multiplicity” or “plurality” (<em>TI</em> 220”“2), which is related to but distinct from the “third party” who calls for justice (<em>TI</em> 157). Alterity itself can be considered as the greatest positive of all, “infinity” (<em>TI</em> 41).

Arithmetical transformations can be illustrated most clearly through the number one. One is invoked as zero, as the neutralizing, nullifying singularities of the “unity of the system” (<em>TI</em> 150) and “universalization” (<em>TI</em> 247). One occurs as singular masculine subjectivity in the “solitude” of “man” (<em>TI</em> 119), as well as in the “happiness [that] comes for the first time” (<em>TI</em> 114), and the apologetic “speech in the first person” (<em>TI</em> 242). Doubling into one occurs in the “dual solitude” (<em>TI</em> 265) of Eros. Dialogically, it manifests in the ethical relation to the Other because the neighbor is “the first one on the scene” (<em>OTB</em> 11), whose “first teaching” of ethical height (<em>TI</em> 171) expresses “the first word’you shall not commit murder’â
 (<em>TI</em> 199). Because the Other is “from the first the brother of all men” (<em>OTB</em> 158), a “community” (<em>TI</em> 214) can arise in which “the unity of plurality is peace” (<em>TI</em> 306).

It is necessary to meditate on this entire network encompassed by the motif of “one” before evaluating Levinas’s assertion that morality is “first philosophy” (<em>TI</em> 304) or to address the problem that he “privileges” masculinity.

Just as there is a certain masculinity associated with the single, femininity is typically manifested as double. Levinas most explicitly refers to the duality of gender in his Judaic writings. “Did not God give the name’Adam’ to man and woman joined together as if the two were one, as if the unity of the person were able to triumph over the dangers lying in wait for it only by virtue of a duality inscribed in its essence” (<em>DF</em> 33). Levinas distinguishes yet relates this biblical story of gender division from the tale of sexual mitosis and nostalgia that Aristophanes recounts in the <em>Symposium</em>, which he instead uses to illustrate the “incestuous” character of Eros (<em>TI</em> 254). Beyond this, 2, by being the first plural after the singular 1, first opens up plurality as such. Thus, Levinas asserts that the vital impulse “presupposes the intervals of sexuality and a specific dualism in its articulation. Sexuality is in us neither knowledge nor power, but the very plurality of our existence” (<em>TI</em> 276).

This theme of doubleness applies not only to gender but to absolutely every movement in Levinas’s thought--the very notion of alterity implies secondariness.[18] Levinas’s entire analysis is built upon changes in direction, so duality enters any time he uses the Latin root <em>verter</em>, to turn,[19] in terms such as “reversion” and “inversion.” This structure of doubling is already within all terms prefixed by “equi,” “
ambi,” “
amphi,” or “dia,” such as “equivocation,” “
ambiguity,” “
amphibology,” “
ambiguity,” and “diachrony.” The double indicates the dynamic tension of the “non-assemblable duality” (<em>OTB</em> 69), and of the diachronic interval “between two times” (<em>TI</em> 58). Doubleness articulates the orientation between every trope, such as the relation between masculine Height and its hyperbolic correlate, feminine Depth. This dynamic reversal occurs not just between the genders in sexuality, but also as the homosocial “man to man,” the ethical “face to face” (<em>TI</em> 79”“81). Through enjoyment and recursion, this doubling is produced even in the relationship between the ego and the self, the <em>moi</em> and the <em>soi</em> (<em>TO</em> 56), the nominative “I”
 and the accusative “me” (<em>OTB</em> 112).

Now that we have a better understanding of the binary character of gender and the importance of duality throughout Levinas’s work, we can begin to think more carefully about the problem of the “Feminine” in Levinas. Not only does Levinas explicitly discuss the feminine and masculine aspects of the Other, a careful reading of his texts indicates that these structures of masculinity and femininity are also present within the Self. This is most evident in his description of the Home, whose condition is the Woman.[20] The principal role of the feminine dwelling is to provide the site for reversion, the base of welcoming (<em>accueil</em>) for recollection (<em>recueillement</em>) (<em>TI</em> 155; <em>TeI 165</em>), of acceptance for receptivity. Levinas describes this phenomenological production, saying “this refers us to its essential interiority, and to the inhabitant that inhabits it before every inhabitant, the welcoming <em>par excellence,</em> welcome in itself “” the feminine being” (<em>TI</em> 157). If Levinas here characterizes feminine alterity by the “welcome” it offers, then we can only conclude that <em>I</em> am figured as a woman only a few pages later. “I welcome the Other who presents <em>himself</em> in my home by opening my home to <em>him</em>“ (<em>TI</em> 171, my italics). In fact, my identification as a welcoming woman is the very basis of Levinasian ethics: “metaphysics, transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same, of the other by me, is concretely produced as the calling into question of the same by the other, that is, as ethics that accomplishes the critical essence of knowledge” (<em>TI</em> 43).

Even more than his linking of womanhood with domesticity, Levinas’s description of the erotic feminine Beloved in “The Phenomenology of Eros” has incurred condemnation from feminist critics for its usage of stereotypical motifs. It is easiest to conceptualize this section if we remember that the French slang for orgasm is “<em>la petite mort,</em>“ the little death. When we read <em>Totality and Infinity</em>“˜s central narrative as being about continuous creation and recreation, we see that the story has brought the subject from childhood enjoyment (147”“51), to matrimony (154”“56), to adult labor and mastery (158”“62), and then to an awareness of temporal mortality (226”“36). After this, the storyline of the “Phenomenology of Eros” transits through the arc of death and rebirth, from “dying without murder” (258), to sexual “voluptuosity as a pure experience” (260), to the womblike “community of sentient and sensed” (265), and then to the “engendering of the child” (266). Within this narrative, Levinas employs several characterizations of the feminine Beloved (<em>aimee</em>) that have given rise to considerable controversy, especially his description of “the beloved return[ing] to the stage of infancy ... [like] a young animal” (<em>TI</em> 263, see Walsh 80”“82 for a critique). In response, one should first point out that the motifs Levinas employs in this section also relate to the wider metaphorical networks that constitute his thought: the “frailty” of the Beloved relates to the dynamics of “destitution;” her “foreignness to the world” relates to the “alterity” of the Other; her secrecy and profanation, hiddenness and monstrousness relate to the question of expression and appearance; her “nudity” relates to the tropes of embodiment and exposure; her “ultramateriality” relates to “matter” and the “body;” her “virginity” and “violability” relate to the problematics of “violence” and “murder.” As mentioned above, the motif of “infancy” partakes in the network of terms connoting birth, which Levinas describes in the phenomenology of separated enjoyment. In this section, Levinas also introduces an almost-Bergsonian notion of “animal need liberated from vegetable dependence.”[21]

This explication does not necessarily blunt the feminist critique of his thought, but it complicates the issue considerably. Simone De Beauvoir is precisely correct: Levinas <em>does</em> “privilege” the masculine. For him, tropes signifying one-ness and first-ness refer to the masculine, and tropes signifying duality and two-ness refer to the feminine. However, it is unclear whether we should necessarily reach from these facts the conservative conclusion that primacy is “better” than secondariness or that masculinity is “better” than femininity.

In <em>Gender Trouble,</em> Judith Butler takes this problem of gender even further by questioning the very binary division of sexuality. “Power appeared to operate in the production of that very binary frame for thinking about gender that binary relation between’men’ and’women’â
 (xxviii). Those attempting to overcome binary gender divisions will find that, in many ways, gender is the binarism of binarisms for Levinas, that it could perhaps be considered the paradigm for all other binarisms. I would argue, however, that sexuality is already so overdetermined for Levinas that it already anticipates or includes within it the movements of deconstruction and dialectic, and thus a deconstructive or dialectical critique must proceed carefully.[22]

Levinas explains repeatedly that the dualism of gender is related to but not reducible to the biological division between the sexes. Thus, we could perhaps use his thought to open up the categories of “masculinity” and “femininity” for various biological genders; to oppose, along with Judith “Jack” Halberstam, the fact that “masculinity has been reserved for people with male bodies and has been actively denied to people with female bodies” (269). Ultimately, for Levinas, no matter the biological or ontological gender, both the Self and the Other always embody both feminine and masculine traits in a state of metaphysical ambisexuality.

The most immediate language that Levinas reappropriates is from the authors who he is already engaged in discussion with. The places to enter Levinas is probably Husserl but start with Heidegger, for whom Levinas was the first person to introduce into French to Sartre and others in his 1932 essay Martin Heidegger et l'ontologie. In this essay Levinas is not thematizign language as such but an engagement with Heidegger is invitably a meditation on the resonances of languages and a curiousity about linguistic roots. Levinas demonstrates several vectors of this linguistic curiousity. 


This essay also sees the introduction of numerous motifs that will recur in various guises throughout his work. Certain motifs which echo more persistently in later texts, such as those of birth and the stranger, may be acquired from Bergson or Jewish liturgy or simply the common inheritance of everyday language. The thematics of Zuhandenheit will be denied in the descriptions of enjoyment, the language of the hand will recur in his description of labor and possessions, as well as the dynamics of giving, the hand that takes breath even culminating in the hand that takes the bread from one's own mouth to give it to the other "the form of a hand that gives even the bread taken from its own mouth."

Rolland: "du moi asoi-meme" reads literally, "of the me to oneself." A few lines farther, Levinas adds, "It is therefore our intimacy, that is, our presence to ourselves [notre presence a nous-memes]." In the first instance, it is not my presence to my-self [moi-meme] that is in question, the soi- of soi-meme is not posited as our identity or our ego or our moi.

Therefore, one might say,
nausea reveals to us the presence of being in all its impotence,
which constitutes this presence as such. It is the impotence of
pure being, in all its nakedness. Therefore, ultimately, nausea
also appears as a fact of consciousness that is "exceptional."

- Existence and Existents

In Existence and Existents, his first published article after the war, he expresses a continuity and a discontinuity.
These studies begun before the war were continued and written down for the most part in
captivity. The stalag is evoked here not as a guarantee of profundity nor as a claim to indulgence,
but as an explanation for the absence of any consideration of those philosophical works
published, with so much impact, between 1940 and 1945.
After the war, Levinas returned to the philosophical community afer having his been imprisoned in a labor cmp and having lost family and friends in the death camps of the holocaust. Levinas declares his need to leave the environment of Heidegger's thought.  
If at the beginning our reflections are in large measure inspired by the philosophy of Martin
Heidegger, where we find the concept of ontology and of the relationship which man sustains
with Being, they are also governed by a profound need to leave the climate of that philosophy,
and by the conviction that we cannot leave it for a philosophy that would be pre-Heideggerian





Now life figures as the prototype of the relationship between an existent and existence.
Hitherto a being was taken to have been given existence by divine decree, or to have it by
virtue of its very essence; its existence thus was taken to belong to it in a natural and
quasi-imperceptible fashion. The new and fundamental idea is that this belongingness is
the very struggle for life.
But the notion of the struggle for existence is not enough to grasp the relationship of an
existent with its existence as deeply as we would like

Bataille
An entire philosophy, neglected only for pragmatic reasons, has as
its aim the establishing of values that would permit individuals to raise them-
selves above human class conditions.

Therefore it was necessary not only
to create new values, but more precisely values able to fill the void left by God:
hence a series of antireligious and ethereal values.

The same double tendency is found in contemporary surrealism, which main-
tains, of course, the predominance of higher ethereal values (clearly expressed
by the addition of the prefix sur, the trap into which Nietzsche had already fallen
with superman)

Time and the Other

It

is thus the being in me, the fact that I exist, my existing, that
constitutes the absolutely intransitive element, something
without intentionality or relationship.

. “¢The Latin word substantia, from which
the English term is derived, is a literal translation of the Greek word hypos-
tasis ("standing under").

Jemeinigkeit10 precisely expresses the fact
that existing is always possessed by someone

The term "word" is surely upsetting because it is pejorative

It already falls under the category
Ã²f the substantive.

More exactly, the appearance of an existent is the very conÂ­
stitution of a mastery, of a freedom in an existing that by itÂ­
self would remain fundamentally anonymous. In order for
there to be an existent in this anonymous existing, it is necÂ­
essary that a departure from self and a return to self””that
is, that the very work of identity””become possible.

the present is a way of accom-
plishing30 the "starting out from itself"

One cannot come from oneself otherwise than by reÂ­
ceiving nothing from the past.

The hyposÂ­
tasis of the present, however, is only one moment of hyposÂ­
tasis; time can indicate another relationship between
existing and the existent. T

It results from the work
of hypostasis. Solitude is the very unity of the existent, the
fact that there is something in existing starting from which
existence occurs. Th

manifest in the fact that it is necessary to be occupied with
oneself.

My being doubles with a havÂ­
ing; I am encumbered by myself.

The first freedom resultant from the fact that in
anonymous existing an existent arises, includes as its price
the very finality of the I riveted to itself.

matter is the misfortune [malheur] of hypostasis.
Materiality and solitude go together.

From this comes the accent of greatness that stirs in a
humanism springing from the economic problem; from
this comes the very power that the demands of the working
class possess to be elevated into a humanism.

Economic struggle is alÂ­
ready on an equal footing with the struggle for salvation
because it is founded in the very dialectic of hypostasis
through which the first freedom is constituted.

both things happen at once.

we want both to recognize material life and its triumph over
the anonymity of existing, and the tragic finality to which it
is bound by its very freedom

powerful.

cohen: To grasp alterity outside even negativity, and thus in a truly positive "sense," is perhaps the essence of Levinas' entire effort. See, in particular, the section entitled "TranscenÂ­dence is Not Negativity" in Totality and Infinity, pp. 40-42; and the Preface,

T he alterity, the radical heterogeneity nf the other, is possible only if
the other is other with respect to a term whose essence is to remain at the
point of departure, to serve as entry into the relation, to be the same not
relatively but absolutely. A term can remain absolutely at the point of
departure of relationship only as I.
T o be I is, over and beyond any individuation that can be derived from
a system of references, to have identity as one’s content. T he I is not a
being that always remains the same, but is the being whose existing
consists in identifying itself, in recovering its identity throughout all that

asymmetry: the radical impossibility of seeing oneself from the outside

experience, the impossibility of forgetting the intersubjective experience
that leads to that social experience and endows it with meaning (as, to

Totalization is accomÂ­
plished only in history””in the history of the historiographers, that is,
among the survivors. I t rests on the affirmation and the conviction
that the chronological order of the history of the historians outlines the
plot of being in itself, analogous to nature.

for the totalization of history to not be the ultimate schema of
being, it is necessary that death which for the survivor is an end be not
only this end; it is necessary that there be in dying another direction than
that which leads to the end as to a point of impact in the duration of
survivors.

In the totality of the historiographer the death of the other is an end,
the point at which the separated being is cast into the totality,
and at which, consequently, dying can be passed through and past, the point from which the separated being will continue by virtue of the heritage his existence had amassed.
But the psychism extracts an existence resistant
to a fate that would consist in becoming “nothing but past” ;
death is consequently not reduciÂ­ble to the end of a being. W hat “still remains” is totally different from
the future that one welcomes, that one projects forth and in a certain
measure draws from oneself. where a triumph over death can have

- VIOLENCE late 13c., "physical force used to inflict injury or damage," from Anglo-French and Old French violence (13c.), from Latin violentia "vehemence, impetuosity," from violentus "vehement, forcible," probably related to violare (see violation). Weakened sense of "improper treatment" is attested from 1590s.
  VIOLATION: c. 1400, from Old French violacion and directly from Latin violationem (nominative violatio) "an injury, irreverence, profanation," from past participle stem of violare "to treat with violence, outrage, dishonor," perhaps an irregular derivative of vis "strength, force, power, energy," from PIE root *weie- "to go after, pursue with vigor or desire" (see gain (v.)).
  *WEIE- : This is from PIE root *weie- "to go after, strive after, pursue vigorously, desire," with noun derivatives indicating "force, power" (related to *wi-ro- "man;" see virile). Cognates include Sanskrit padavi- "track, path, trail," veti- "follows, strives, leads, drives;" Avestan vateiti "follows, hunts;" Greek hiemai "move oneself forward, strive, desire;" Lithuanian vyti "to chase, pursue;" Old Norse veiÃ°r "chase, hunting, fishing;" Old English OE waÃ° "a chase, hunt."

Unlike traditional Judaism, which provides a set of detailed guidelines called "halakha" that are scrupulously followed by observant Jews and regulate many aspects of life,[4] Frank claimed that "all laws and teachings will fall"[5] and ““ following antinomianism ““ asserted that the most important obligation of every person was the transgression of every boundary.[6]

> And yet this extreme fragility lies also at the limit of an existence “without ceremonies,” “
without circumlocutions,” a “non-signifying” and raw density, an exorbitant ultramateriality. These superlatives, better than metaphors, denote a sort of paroxysm of materiality. Ultramateriality does not designate a simple absence of the human in the piles of rocks and sands of a lunar landscape, nor the materiality that outdoes itself, gaping under its rent forms, in ruins and wounds; it designates the exhibitionist nudity of an exorbitant presence coming as though from farther than the frankness of the face, already profaning and wholly profaned, as if it had forced the interdiction of a secret. The essentially hidden throws itself toward the light, without becoming signiÂ­fication. Not nothingness””but what is not yet. This unreality at the . . l’AimÂ£ qui est AimÂ£e. “ threshold of the real does not offer itself as a possible to be grasped; the dandestinity does not describe a gnoseological accident that occurs to a being. “Being not yet” is not a this or a that; dandestinity exhausts the essence of this non-essence. In the effrontery of its production this clan- destinity avows a nocturnal life not equivalent to a diurnal life simply deprived of light; it is not equivalent to the simple inwardness of a solitary and inward life which would seek expression in order to overÂ­come its repression. It refers to the modesty it has profaned without overcoming. The secret appears without appearing, not because it would appear half-way, or with reservations, or in confusion. The simultaneity of the clandestine and the exposed precisely defines profanation. It appears in equivocation. But it is profanation that permits equivocation “”essentially erotic””and not the reverse. Modesty, insurmountable in love, constitutes its pathos. Immodesty, always dared in the presentation of wanton nudity, is not something added to an antecedent neutral perception, such as that of the doctor who examines the nudity of the patient. The mode in which erotic nudity is produced (is presented and is) delineates the original phenomena of immodesty and profanation. The moral perspectives they open are situated already in the singular dimension opened by this exorbitant exhibitionism, which is a producÂ­tion of being. Let us in passing note that this depth in the subterranean dimension of the tender prevents it from being identified with the graceful, which it nevertheless resembles. The simultaneity or the equivocation of this fragility and this weight of non-signifyingness [non-significance], heavier than the weight of the formless real, we shall term femininity. The movement of the lover before this frailty of femininity, neither pure compassion nor impassiveness, indulges in compassion,\* is absorbed in the complacence of the caress. The caress, like contact, is sensibility. But the caress transcends the sensible. It is not that it would feel beyond the felt, further than the senses, that it would seize upon a sublime food while maintaining, within its relation with this ultimate felt, an intention of hunger that goes unto the food promised, and given to, and deepening this hunger, as though the caress would be fed by its own hunger. The caress consists in seizing upon nothing, in soliciting what ceaselessly escapes its form toward a future never future enough, in soliciting what slips away as though it . . te complatt dans la compassion . . .” were not yet. It searches, it forages. It is not an intentionality of disclosure but of search: a movement unto the invisible. In a certain sense it expresses love, but suffers from an inability to tell it. It is hungry for this very expression, in an unremitting increase of hunger. It thus goes further than to its term, it aims beyond an existent however future, which, precisely as an existent, knocks already at the gates of being. The desire that animates it is reborn in its satisfaction, fed somehow by what is not yet, bringing us back to the virginity, forever inviolate, of the feminine. It is not that the caress would seek to dominate a hostile freedom, to make of it its object or extort from it a consent. Beyond the consent or the resistance of a freedom the caress seeks what is not yet, a “less than nothing,” closed and dormant beyond the future, consequently dormant quite otherwise than the possible, which would be open to anticipation. The profanation which insinuates itself in caressing responds adequately to the originality of this dimenÂ­sion of absence””an absence other than the void of an abstract nothingÂ­ness, an absence referring to being, but referring to it in its own way, as though the “absences” of the future were not all future on the same level and uniformedly. Anticipation grasps possibles; what the caress seeks is not situated in a perspective and in the light of the graspable. The carnal, the tender par excellence correlative of the caress, the beloved, is to be identified neither with the body-thing of the physiologist, nor with the lived body [corps propre] of the “I can,” nor with the body- expression, attendance at its own manifestation, or face. In the caress, a relation yet, in one aspect, sensible, the body already denudes itself of its very form, offering itself as erotic nudity. In the carnal given to tenderness, the body quits the status of an existent.

Levinas uses philosophical terms to indicate a certain genealogy of metaphorics, histories of tropological concepts, often emanating from the name of the writer who first described them. For example, the slogan "ethics is first philosophy" immediately evokes the memory of Aristotle's prote philosophe and Descartes' prima philospohia. Similarly, whenever Levinas uses the term "Totality" as a literal metonym for "Hegel", a direct address with illocutionary force, and uses the metaphoric to interrogate an entire metaphorical-conceptual structure implicit throughout the history of Western philosophy since its Greek beginning. Levinas widens the scope of Hegel's term too widely in this effort to encompass a broad metaphorics within the text of philosophy, the the point that his polemic against Hegel becomes demonstrably unfair.

EPITHETs adjectivals as names.  
the adjectival, epithet An epithet (from Greek: á¼Ï
 epitheton, neuter of á¼Ï
 epithetos, "attributed, added")[1] is a byname, or a descriptive term (word or phrase), accompanying or occurring in place of a name and having entered common usage. It has various shades of meaning when applied to seemingly real or fictitious people, divinities, objects, and binomial nomenclature. It can also be a descriptive title: for example, Pallas Athena, Alfred the Great, Suleiman the Magnificent or WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw I the Elbow-high.

"descriptive name for a person or thing," 1570s, from Middle French Ã©pithÃ¨te or directly from Latin epitheton (source also of Spanish epÃ­teto, Portuguese epitheto, Italian epiteto), from Greek epitheton "an epithet; something added," noun use of adjective (neuter of epithetos) "attributed, added, assumed," from epitithenai "to add on," from epi "in addition" (see epi-) + tithenai "to put, to place," from reduplicated form of PIE root \*dhe- "to set, put." Related: Epithetic; epithetical.

names, calling someone a name, why disguise a name, name as an insult, in mexico it is common to call someone "Chaparro" (shorty) or "Moreno" (dark-skinned)? Identificaiton under a proper name or as a category is already a violence because of the way it calls them out in speech, summarizes their lived experince under a singular designation. thus, in congo to register their opposition to Seso and other leaders, Franco Lumba sang in mbwakela. mbwakela (Soki nalobi bokokanga ngai ndoki), It’s a phrase, a couple of sentences, even a whole song where you say something insulting or critical without its being easily understood, the coded language of resistance, a secret discourse that goes on under the noses of tyrants and oppressors, such as when _soukous_ pioneer Franco Luambo Makiadi sang about "Le Tailleur" [https://youtu.be/mI2_rvPFO_M](https://youtu.be/mI2_rvPFO_M)[[31](#31)], understanding his critique of Mobutu Sese Seko.[[32](#32)] Also this is why we call people names, as insults. Consider not "Moreno" but "le negre" of the colonialist fantastic in Rimbaud's "Mauvais Sang"[[33](#33)], "nigger" in beatniks like Norman Mailer and poets like Patti Smith, and all of the different possible meanings in all of the different voices coming from all of the different bodies.

Lubangi Muaniania refers to “mbwakela” and “throwing one or two sentences (of mbwakela).” Mbwakela is central to understanding Congolese culture.

Mbwakela thus originally refers to a culture of metaphors, indirect communication, and is
embedded within conflict between people with a power difference. The one with less power is
provoking or challenging someone with more power, though does so in a subtle, deniable
fashion. One of the most important elements of what we could call a “˜classic mbwakela’ is
exactly its convolutedness and indirectness.

as mbwakela is usually articulated from a “˜powerless position

It is argued that Franco actually learned the art of mbwakela from his mother, who was a
ndumba (an unmarried woman) in LÃ©opoldville. Still today, violence and conflict are easily
associated with women.

The online mbwakela mediates social and political forms of distance, as expressed in the
indirectness of the genre, embodied in migrants’ living bodies and emphasised by the digitality
of the mbwakela’s circulation. It is exactly this affordance of distance preservation that pushed
Combattants to produce online mbwakela. In this way, the material shows the ambiguity of the
spatial work of media in the generation of conflict. Instead of compressing space by virtually
connecting distant spaces, online media can also emphasise and allow people to take advantage
of distance and dislocation by emphasising these.


m. Franco was also the master of allegorical lyrics; his use of Mbwakela ““ the art of criticising without being easily understood ““ was a mainstay in his oeuvre. In 1966, he released Luvumbu Ndoki, a threnody for the victims of Mobutu’s public executions, which had been carried out in that same year. This was a clear rebuke against the ruling regime and, resultantly, throughout his career, certain songs of his were censored.

Levinas calls out to Nietzsche through various metaphorics throughout his texts. Most importantly, Nietzsche's question "Are we lied to by morality" is posed at the preface, the pre-face, the pre-original of Totality and Infinity, where Nietzsche's question of whether we are "duped by morality" [[4](#4)], merely the masquerade of a Will to Power, followed by Heraclitus's threat that being is _polemos_ and thus all philosophy is war [[5](#5)], followed by protests against Hegel's totality and Aristotelian plastic [[6](#6)], followed by the cries to justice of Marx and Nietzsche [[7](#7)]. Levinas calls out Nietzsche by name in several places, referring to him as the astonishing continuous rebirth of subjectivity, its Eternal Return, in Otherwise than Being, obviously referring in the "laughter that refuses language" (as well as the playful writing of Derrida) [[8](#8)] but also in the laughter of the madman and the witches of Macbeth [[9](#9)], the old chiless barren old spinsters who control the future, that a powerful man shall not harmed by "none of woman born"[10](#10), from _mac_: son in Scottish and _beth_: house in Hebrew [[11](#11)]. One can also hear Nietzsche hidden in plain sight whenever Levinas refers to "masks" under the problematics of appearance -- also Fanon in black and white. One of the way that Levinas engages most clearly with Nietzsche is through his usage and explicit discussions of "metaphor", a carrying over or a bearing outwards.


Before we take up the matter, the materiality, of metaphor, we must first discuss the matter of poetic speech in general. Poetry has a long and storied history within the text of philosophy. But did not Thales discover the materiality of water as a metaphor, before Aristotle subsumbed this as the first _arche_[[15](#15)]? Or the dynamic of _polemos_ is the first metaphor for the first philosopher Heraclitus? But then Plato the playwright will punish us for our poetry, expelling us, excising us from the _polis_, casting us out into exodus from the Republic!

EDIT THIS SECTION ON D RPH
RPH is an important part of this, the relationship between materiality and ideality. Same basic idea of it thorughout his works and even the exact same metaphorics, so it is useful to trace out their intersection of materiality and ideality. Levinas uses the same verbiage and essentially the same concepts
(1) Jewish/Chrisian: materiality afflicts the body as a physical suffering and as remorse
(2) Western/Christian and Western idealism -- body is separable from the mind
(3) Marxist -- bodily suffering politics to liberate spirit
(4) Fascist -- enrootedness in the body is authentic.
Never says that materiality is bad and idealism is good, and in fact proposes the Jewish conception of reconciling body and spirit,through remorse as a good one, remorse a metaphorics of eating thorughout his work and will use explicitly in Otherwise than Being

The moral anger against the violence of the holocaust. Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism. However, Levinas also warns about the pagan hypnotism of poetry, a pagan enrootedness in language, language as a materiality. and evidenced in Heidegger's intense attention to the poetry of language, including the etymological terminology, and the Language as the House of Being, and then ultimately turning to the nationalist poetic of Holderlin and Trakl into a poetic, pagan. But Levinas is anything but a typical philosopher and it is unclear to assimilate him exactly to Plato, but maybe so. Also the condemnation of Heidegger, the poetic ecstasy that lead to Nazism In Reflections on Philosophy of Hitlerism, this enchantment of the poetical vortices that are the enticement to pagan Violence.

Despite Levinas's concerns about the violence of pagan poetic violence, we can still trace a constant dialogue with Nietzsche, this genealogy, this story, this history, this maternity, this gynecology, through his discussion and usage of metaphor

Writing and Difference
This moment is the emergence of the thought of Being itself, the very movement of metaphoricity. For this emergence still, and always, occurs beneath an other metaphor. As Hegel says somewhere, empiricism always forgets, at very least, that it employs the words to be. Empiricism is thinking by metaphor without thinking the metaphor as such.

## Metaphor as Polemic

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The tone of the moral voice in Levinas interpretation can be heard already in the tropes used in a recent article on Levinas's usage of of metaphor. The first line of the Abstract of Scott Davidson's "Metaphorical Transcendence" announces "In his published work, Levinas only mentions metaphor for the sake of dismissing its relevance to his ethics of transcendence." (366)

From even before the beginning of the article itself, in its preface and distillation, Davidson considers Levinas to be engaged in a polemic against metaphor. Within the first line, a struggle emerges between our protagonist Levinas and the category of metaphor itself, which Davidson describes as something that Levinas considers "only for the sake of dismissing it." Before we even consider the merits of Davidson's argument, we are already struck by the violence of the language -- the category of metaphor is described as something that is forcibly discarded, tossed into the trash as worthless. Is such aggressive language appropriate for commentaries on the writing of Levinas, a text that opens by questioning whether phisophical thought has too often considered the truth of Being, the being of Truth, in terms of war, of Heraclitean _polemos_ (TI 18)? And should a scholar of Levinas resort to metaphors of deprecation that cast the enemy interlocutor as something cast out, discarded as garbage; especially when one considers how frequently his tropes describe ethical encounters with the Other (and the Self) in terms of misery, as naked and cold, as homeless and hungry, as outcast, dismissed, and discarded?

Levinas's question of whether Western thought and culture is rooted in war echoes the analysis of feminist scholar Nancy Hartsock. Hartsock recounts a genealogy of how much our conceptualization and action still inherit from the heritage of the birth of the Greek _polis_ (city-state) from what she terms the "barracks community." Within this military encampment, human relationships were conceived as being fundamentally antagonistic and competitive, as struggles for power and domination. Hartsock claims that war and the masculine role of the warrior-hero have been central to our conception of politics ever since: for example, as the citizen's dominance on the battlefield of rhetoric of the _agora_, and as the businessman’s dominance on the field of commerce (Hartsock, 1982, pp. 285”“6). To the extent that the ideal of the philosopher is rooted in Heraclitean polemics or in Plato's claim that the ideal military guardians of the _polis_ should be philosophers, hasn't philosophy also inherited the terminology, equally martial and juridical, of argument and struggle? To what extent is philosophy committed to a fantasy of a War for Truth?

In a manner typical of many philosophers and especially many scholars of Levinas, Davidson alludes to the imaginary of the Barracks Community in his article, repeatedly invoking metaphors of combat, invoking the wartime division of dialectic analysis as friend and enemy. For the most part, Davidson's usage of such terminology is relatively benign, so commonplace that one could easily fail to hear the martial echoes of "aligning" metaphor and disclosre (367) or "dividing philosophical treatments of metaphors into two camps." (368) Davidson can only resolve the metaphorics of war through an antinomy of the wartime ally and the wartime enemy by claiming "Levinas’s stance, as a result, is at once aligned with and against metaphor." From this quote another martial metaphorics can be discerned: the positionality of the philosopher is a "stance", a position that has been "staked out" in a field of battle.

Within this theater of war, Levinas occupies a strategic position, on the one hand attacking the "ontology of immanence", and on the other defending himself from "famous challengers" such as Jacques Derrida -- and implicitly, by extention, Nietzsche. Davidson stations himself as the guardian of Levinas and Levinas as the guardian of seriousness against play and metaphor, claiming that one should not read him metaphorically because it would "undercut the ethical seriousness in which Levinasian discourse shrouds itself. Levinas’s ethical project would be reduced to a play of words; it would become a rhetorical strategy, a game that sets out to praise one set of metaphors over other metaphors." (372) Here, Davidson's insight is fascinating: even though he warns against reducing ethics to a rhetorical contest for domination, he still seeks to defend "seriousness" by maintaining its superior position.

Similar to many other scholars of Levinas, Davidson situates Levinas's writing in opposition to Heidegger, arraying the metaphors of Levinas's terminology against those of Heidegger. The abstract asserts "Levinas aligns metaphor with disclosure and the work of ontology, whereas he identifies his ethics with a 'revelation' of the other that is straightforward, direct, and immediate." (367) However, aren't each of these terms already a metaphor -- what are straightforwardness, directness, and immediacy other than metaphors that also refer to the manner in which one stakes out a strategic position and then move towards one's target. In any case, does Levinas really use any of this terminology in such a univocal manner? Each of these metaphors does occur in the text of Levinas, but typically in a inverted, subverter, perverter, or reverted form. For example, Davidson claims, as mentioned above, that the ethical is "shrouded", already a dark subversion of immediacy. Additionally, Levinas's orientation to the metaphorics and concepts of other philosophers is not one of simple friend/enemy opposition, but a one that is multivocal -- at turns inversive, subversive, perversive, or reversive -- often parodies of their language. For example, Levinas transforms the semantics of the Being of Heidegger's generous German "es gibt" (translated literally: "it gives") by translating it, carrying it from one language to another, sromancing it into French, substituting one set of terms for another, as the impersonal posession of an "il y a" (translated literally: "it has there"). Only one of these Levinas's four voices inverts relationships of domination in a way that can be read as polemics. We will return below to this discussion of the how Levinas employs perspectives to orient metaphors in relation to each other and himself vis-a-vis other philosophers, but for now we will simply point out that the operative conjunction between the two terms in Levinas's first title is "and" rather than "or", suggesting something composite and complexly layered rather than any outright conflict.

Most importantly, Davidson fails to appreciate how deeply committed Levinas's analysis are to metaphors, especially where he most apparently denies them. Davidson claims "In Otherwise than Being, [Levinas] goes on to insist that 'the suffering of constriction in one’s skin' describes the ethical encounter in a way that is 'better than metaphors.'" (367) Quite obviously, "constriction in one's skin" is a very vivid metaphor. However, of what exactly? For this we need to read the entire sentence written by Levinas, rather than just picking phrases that add ammunition to our argument. "Or do the being encumbered with oneself and the suffering of constriction in one’s skin, better than metaphors, follow the exact trope of an alteration of essence, which inverts, or would invert, into a recurrence in which the expulsion of self outside of itself is its substitution for the other?" (OTB 110) This entire sentence is already metaphorical or tropological, and the metaphor or trope can already be understood by considering the empirical etymologies of these terms. Davidson recognizes that "meta-phor" etymologically signifies "carrying over" but perhaps imagines only Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders or perhaps Hermes carrying a message. These images of patriarchal heroes are echoed by another, feminine semantics. An etymological dictionary explains the derivation: "metaphor ... from meta "over, across" (see meta-) + pherein 'to carry, bear,' from PIE root \*bher- (1) 'to carry,' also 'to bear children.'" Levinas often uses the language of superlative goodness such as "better" to describe the emergent creation of something new. Our same etymological dictionary explains that "trope", an apparent synonym of "metaphor", dervives from the root meaning "to turn." With this in mind, we can reread the entire sentence to understand how it narrates a story of pregnancy, gestation, childbirth, and new life, thereby implying that metaphor literally is a moment of ethical substition, of the birthing of the Self from its responsibility for the Other and for others, a fact which Davidson himself acknowledges.

We shall instead turn to Sandor Goodhart's marvelous discussion of the fourfold Jewish hermeneutic. Goodhart explains that Jewish hermeneutics uses fourfold: the first duality between the literal facts _peshat_, the symbolic or contextual doctrine _remez_; and a second duality between the moral or ethical rhetoric of the _derash_, and the mystical or secret prophetic _sod_. There are many ways of understanding these terms, but a common one is the separation of the literal level (_peshat_) from the symbolic or contextual level (_remez_),and the further separation of these two from the moral or ethical level (_derash_), and from the mystical or secret level (_sod_), the literal opposed to a threefold allegorical of symbolic, moral, and esoteric.

"_Derash_ is the third level of interpretative understanding. The word "midrash" derives from it, as numerous commentators point out, adding on the preposition mi- to the word _derash_. It refers to inquiry, an inquiring into or, conversely, a drawing out of or extracting from text that is perhaps somewhat obscure. _Derash_ institutes a comparison or outlines implications so that a *remez*ed _peshat_, so to speak, may be more effectively understood, and knowledge about it may be acquired. Fishbane notes that _derash_ also refers to the formal, compositional, stylistic casts in which a text works, for example, its tropological structure.32 Since it sometimes involves narrative or aggadic materials, as opposed to halachic materials that specify the code in which some words are to be understood, it is sometimes designated as "aggadic midrash." It is also sometimes identified with the homiletic, with the moral and/or ethical obligations imposed upon us as a result of a text, the ways in which the story relates to the real lives we lead. In contrast to _remez_ (which is always to some extent hidden), _derash_ takes place on the surface (like _peshat_) rather than within a context and expresses the function of a meaningful sentence outside the expected context, in relation to a moral agent perhaps, or in relation to an evident rhetorical structure. _Derash_ answers the questions: To what may this meaningful statement be compared? What are its implications, morally or ethically, for me personally or for us as a group? What need I do as a result of it? How shall I understand its implications from a comparable context or for us as a group?"[[28](#28)]

The reason why this reading-by-metaphor is important is because it allows us to subvert, pervert and invert the orthodox interpretations of Levinas. Orthodox readings of Levinas such as that of Richard Cohen tend to read Levinas as a series of dogmatic platitudes such as "Ethics is first philosophy" and "Thou shalt not kill!", failing to closely read the full context in which these appear. Within Totality and Infinity at least three things are happening: (1) Levinas tells us from the outset that his philosophy is radically perspectival, that the entire analysis derives from considering the orientation of the Self with respect to the Other. (2) Each section within the text is essentially a repetition of the same analysis from a different perspective. This can be tracked by noticing that the same constellations of metaphors are repeated over and over again, with subtle variations to indicate the perspectival shift. (3) The book recounts a biblical narrative of Genesis, of continuous creation, starting from birth to marriage to old age to death to rebirth. The maxim "Thou Shalt Not Kill" occurs after a description of the phenomenology of murder, and is intended to clarify that, although from one perspective murder is materially possible, it is metaphysically impossible because something about the murdered person still persists. From another perspective, not only is murder materially possible, it is existentially commonplace. The phenomenology of "murder" is a perspectivally-shifted description on the event of death, an event that occurs within every moment of existence, as the death of each moment. Thus, for Levinas, materiality itself is the the corpse of dead matter, similar to Marx's conception of capital as "dead labor"; those who consume materiality are referred to as "survivors' and so forth.

Perspectivism
HEGEL: (c) But the truth of this certainty is really a double reflection, the duplication of self-consciousness.
NIETZCHE: Only a perspective seeing, seeings are determined by Will-to-Power, elan vital, conatus essendi
"ethics is an optics"
"This curvature of the intersubjective space inflects distance into elevation; it does not falsify being, but makes its truth first possible."
"The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work.""

Now that we have proposed an immanent hermeneutical strategy, we are bold enough to ask the broader interpretive question: what are Levinas’s books about? What storyline runs through his work? When we pay close attention to the etymological and the semantic networks immanent to his sentences, we notice that the same motifs crop up again and again under new transformations.[9] Derrida gives us an insight into how metaphors develop through Levinas’s work: “Totality and Infinity “¦ proceeds with the infinite insistence of waves on a beach: return and repetition, always, of the same wave against the same shore, in which, however, as each return recapitulates itself, it also infinitely renews and enriches itself” (WD 312, n7). That is, Levinas’s writing, both across the span of his works and within a single text, can be understood as a process of reiterative rewriting. Despite the fact that Totality and Infinity is broken up into a certain number of sections, chapters and subsections; and that Otherwise than Being was published 12 years after Totality and Infinity; and that Levinas’s religious work must be distinguished from his philosophical writings, I would argue that Levinas discusses one and only one thing again and again: I confront you; or, put dialogically, I converse with the Other; you say some thing to me and I listen, and then I say some thing to you and you listen.

What animates Levinas’s corpus is that each new analysis gives us a new perspective on this singular situation. I would in fact argue that the notion of “perspectivism” is as important for understanding Levinas’s work as it is for Nietzsche’s.[10] Although the dialogical relation of speech surmounts the theoretical stance of vision, Levinas still retains the notion of perspective, explaining that “ethics itself is an optics” (TI 23). He does not abandon visuality, but instead warps it, perverts it.[11] “The differences between the Other and me “¦ are due to the I-Other conjuncture, to the inevitable orientation of being “˜starting from oneself’ towards “˜the Other.’ The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work” (TI 215).[12]

Once we understand the way that Levinas’s perspectives bend, we can begin to reflect upon the metaphorical networks that illuminate his work. Most frequently, Levinas indicates the double-sidedness of a phenomenological event by reversing a perspective. For example, to claim only that the Other is situated in an elevated state as the “Most High” is to miss the full dynamic mobilization of this metaphor. The “height” of the other is the hyperbolic correlate and the perspectival reversal of the “the upsurge of the self (le surgisment de soi) “¦ One becomes a subject of being “¦ [by] an exaltation, an “˜above being’â
 (TI 119, TeI 123). Keeping in mind that the French root “sur” means “over,” we can then understand why Levinas insists that we experience history as a “SURvivor” (TI 57), why infinity “SURpasses itself” (TI 103), and why fecund temporality is a “reSURrection” (TI 56). Through a different perspectival reversal, this height of separation can also be expressed as “an abyss within enjoyment itself” (TI 141), which becomes articulated as my “hypostasis” (TO 54-55) and the Other’s “destitution” (TI 78).

The second principle is that although these four levels are distinguishable “” the scriptural from the symbolic from the ethical from the prophetic “” they are not, in fact, strictly speaking, separable. One refers inevitably to the other. You cannot consider one independently of the context of the other three.

## Tropologies

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Rather than focusing on the obvious rhetorical gestures Levinas makes, a radical reading must look carefully at the immanent play of tropes within his work. Levinas’s writing can only be understood through a close investigation of the interconnections and transformation between clusters of metaphors. Derrida slyly indicates this problem when he explains that “everything which Levinas designates as “˜formal logic’ is contested in its root. This root would not only be the root of our language, but the root of all western philosophy” (WD 91).

Derrida’s hint suggests that the easiest place to begin looking at Levinas’s immanent wordplay would be in his etymological roots. For example, the Indo-European root “STA” has a long tradition in philosophy. Greek thought articulates it as “hypoSTAsis,” which is transformed into Latin as “subSTAntia.” In “The Origin of the Work of Art,” Heidegger considers this translation of philosophical terms to be one of the primordial stages in the forgetting of Being (BW 153). He redeploys this root using terms common to the German philosophical tradition such as “VerSTAnd” (understand), “GegenSTAnd” (represent) and “VorSTEllung” (notion), and he coins new terms such as “GeSTEll” (enframing) (BW 301). Almost parodying Heidegger, Levinas retranslates this German lexicon back into a Latin tongue, “romancing” the words back into a Romance language.[8] Not only does Levinas reclaim the term “hypostasis,” he transmutes this root into terms such as “deSTItution,” “
subSTItution,” and “inSTItution.”

Derrida warns against the temptations of etymological thinking (MP 210), so I would not make the strong claim that Levinas puts his faith in the French language the same way Heidegger considers German to be the “House of Being” (BW 193). Whatever the ultimate ontological status of language, it seems clear that Levinas carefully picks each word in his texts with attention to its etymological and morphological resonances. In the 1940s, Levinas displays this extraordinary attention to linguistic detail by noting that what Heidegger’s “being-in-the-world,” “
being-for-death,” and “being-with-Others” add to our philosophical knowledge “is that these prepositions ““ “
inâ
, 
for
, and “˜with’ are in the root of the verb “˜to be’ (as “˜ex’ is in the root of the verb “˜to exist’)”
 (Wahl 50). Thus, we should assume that Levinas is always aware of roots, prefixes, and suffixes; of the nominal, verbal, prepositional, adjectival, and adverbial parts of speech; of the active, middle, and passive voices; of the nominative, vocative, dative, genitive, ablative, accusative and even locative cases.

In addition to these morphological considerations, we must attend to the semantic connections between various etymological networks. For example, words rooted in “STA” (e.g. stand), must be correlated with other etymological networks connoting position and proximity, as well as those connoting height and depth. The very word “origin” comes from oriri, to rise: for Levinas, man has “overcome” the “destitution” of his “animal needs” (TI 116-17) to become homo erectus, already erect and masterful and virile.

Now that we have proposed an immanent hermeneutical strategy, we are bold enough to ask the broader interpretive question: what are Levinas’s books about? What storyline runs through his work? When we pay close attention to the etymological and the semantic networks immanent to his sentences, we notice that the same motifs crop up again and again under new transformations.[9] Derrida gives us an insight into how metaphors develop through Levinas’s work: “Totality and Infinity “¦ proceeds with the infinite insistence of waves on a beach: return and repetition, always, of the same wave against the same shore, in which, however, as each return recapitulates itself, it also infinitely renews and enriches itself” (WD 312, n7).

## Water Water The Fourfold Verter

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Hegel Fourfold: 9. Self-consciousness is faced by another self-consciousness; it has come out of itself. This has a twofold significance: first, it has lost itself, for it finds itself as an other being; secondly, in doing so it has superseded the other, for it does not see the other as an essential being, but in the other sees its own self. 180. It must supersede this otherness of itself. This is the supersession of the first ambiguity, and is therefore itself a second ambiguity. First, it must proceed to supersede the other independent being in order thereby to become certain of itself as the essential being; secondly, in so doing it proceeds to supersede its own self, for this other is itself.

Fourfold Hermeneutic
can look like a dual tension, the saying of the Other as opposed to the representation in the said of metaphor, as Davidson as others would have it.
One can see the same fourfold structure within the economy of metaphor within Levinas's. We can construct this as the literal as opposed to terminology that acts as the inverters, subverters, perverters of the literal, or we can recognize that the literal is already a reverter, and thus we have four verters. threefold inversion, subversion, and perversion; or we can recognize that the literal is already a reversion, so we have four -verters

One of the most common motifs Levinas employs is that of the superlative, utilizing phrases such as "more" and "better" and nouns like "excess" to describe various relationships. Perhaps the most simple place to understand this is through the description of height. To be is already to stand. _stÄ-_, Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to stand, set down, make or be firm," The root of the word to stand to exist to be _homo erectus_, to be virile and strong and masculine. Thus the model of self-assertive subjectivity can be understood as a standing up for oneself, a simple reflexivity.

What animates Levinas’s corpus is that each new analysis gives us a new perspective on this singular situation. I would in fact argue that the notion of “perspectivism” is as important for understanding Levinas’s work as it is for Nietzsche’s.[10] Although the dialogical relation of speech surmounts the theoretical stance of vision, Levinas still retains the notion of perspective, explaining that “ethics itself is an optics” (TI 23). He does not abandon visuality, but instead warps it, perverts it.[11] “The differences between the Other and me “¦ are due to the I-Other conjuncture, to the inevitable orientation of being “˜starting from oneself’ towards “˜the Other.’ The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work” (TI 215).[12]

## Radical Empiricism

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Look at etymological roots

After Derrida's close reading of the metaphors Levinas uses in his first book, Levinas's second major work Otherwise Than Being displays a new level of self-awareness towards his use of language. Throughout the text, Levinas repeatedly meditates on linguistic parts of speech and seems to be dropping hints about "radical empiricism", the empiricism of word roots, which seemingly winks back to Derrida's discussion of "etymological empiricism". In this text, Levinas largely abandons the almost biblical storytelling of creation and resurrection but the narrative is always implicit in everything he writes and the same metaphorics reoccur under new transformations -- as mentioned above "hypostasis" reoccurs as "substitution". Additionally, Levinas explicitly refers to both metaphors and tropes in this work and uses each in a metaphorical or tropological manner.

The semantics of these metaphors are mapped directly to etymological wordplay. For example the Indo-European etymological root "STA", to stand or set in place, has played a fundamental role in philosophy, rooting fundamental concepts such as "substance" and "existence" as well as "VorSTEllung" and specialized Hedgerows terminology such as "GeSTEll". Levinas employs these etymological roots in a deliberate manner, describing the Self in its material concreteness as a "hypostasis" but shifting towards "destitution" when describing the Other's materiality (NB: After inspecting the original, I see that "destitution" is the translator's rendering of "miser", so I will have to rework this example); in his later work Levinas refers to this same moment as a "substitution". It would be worthwhile to index within the work of Levinas (1) The etymological roots; (2) The morphological transformation of these roots; (3) The correspondence between semantic groupings (egg: metaphors of the family) and etymological roots; (4) the coordination of various constellations of terms. Most obviously Levinas arrays terms "amphibological" in the sense that each term is paired with its opposite, such that the Other is described both in terms of its Height and its Destitution. Beyond this, terms seem to be coordinated in specific ways that should be indexed. (5) I am currently developing a software project to map some of these interrelations. I could actually ugse some help with the envisioning of it. (https://github.com/mcverter/EthicalPataphysicsOfAnarchism/tree/master/RadicalEmpiricism)

 Ontologism in its broadest meaning remained the fundamental dogma of all thought. Despite all its subtlety, it remained prisoner of an elementary and simple principle, according to which one could think and feel only that which exists or is supposed to exist. A principle more imperious than that of non-contradiction, since here nothingness itself-to the degree that thinking encounters it-gets clothed with existence, and so we must without restriction state, against Parmenides, that non-being is.

  Thus, we should assume that Levinas is always aware of roots, prefixes, and suffixes; of the nominal, verbal, prepositional, adjectival, and adverbial parts of speech; of the active, middle, and passive voices; of the nominative, vocative, dative, genitive, ablative, accusative and even locative cases.

Look at Blanchot on the "ex" in exodus. Blanchot indicates the current post-World War 2 problematics for European hegemony antisemitism and anticonolonialism by discussing two of the leading thinkiers of the topic, Albert Memmi and Jean-Paul Satre . Blanchot's observation of the "ex" occurs after this statement, of "exist", "exodus", "exile", "experience", "exigency", "extending", "extreme", "excluded", "exercise", "exterior"
"To speak, in a word, is to seek the source of meaning in the prefix that the words exile, exodus, existence, exteriority, and estrangement are committed to unfolding in various modes of experience; a prefix that for us designates distance and separation as the origin of all “positive value.”" [[41](#41)](128)

Exception 'pataphysical
Alfred Jarry explains that "'Pataphysics will be, above all, the science of the particular, despite the common opinion that the only science is that of the general. 'Pataphysics will examine the laws governing exceptions, and will explain the universe supplementary to this one.” The problematic of particularity versus generality has a long history in philosophy that I do not know offhand. Certainly we can correlate it to Hume's discussion of the inferring a general rule, that the sun always rises, from having observed it in the past; perhaps also Hegel has something interesting to say about Absolute Particularity. In any case, the language of "exceptionality" is important for Levinas. Levinas uses the preface "ex" throughout his work, to describe a mode of escaping the realm of generality, the domination of Being. In Time and the Other, he describes the self's transformation through time as a process of "excendence" and throughout his later work uses terms like "exception" to refer to the revelation of both the other and the self. The important idea here is that both Self and Other are absolutely unique presences in the fabric of reality, exceptions to the generality of the world. I would like to expand on the idea of the 'pataphysical exception through a meditation on a few other affiliated concepts. I would claim that the aesthetics of wabi-sabi both have a Levinasian resonance and illustrate the idea of exceptionality. Wabi-sabi is the Japanese artistic practice of emphasizing the beauty of the accidental or the broken, for example by sealing a shattered bowl with melted gold, thus emphasizing the beauty of the breakage. This aspect of the accidental, this appreciation of the breakages, echoes with Levinas's own usage of the term "trauma" to illustrate the constitution of identity. This appreciation for breakage also resonates with several important spiritual concepts. First of all, the Buddhist doctrine that _samsara_ is _nirvana_ means exactly this, that the disparate flux of illusion is already the object of enlightenment. Secondly I would like to claim that the Sabbatai Sevi's act of Jewish apostasy is exactly his defiance of the Lurianic doctrine of Tiqqun Olam, the repair of the world, an insistence that the world in its fragmentary state is already sanctified. The analysis of the 'pataphysical helps us to understand that how our ordinary and everyday experiences of imperfection are already ethical. Levinas's entire corpus aims not for holism or perfection but instead a richer understanding of the ethical

## Metaphor as Childbirth

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Analytic / Neurolinguistic Basis My discussion of metaphor in general will draw on three primary sources: Derrida's White Mythology: Metaphor in the Text of Philosophy, Lakoff and Johnson's "Metaphors we Live By", and one of the essays by Elisabeth Camp. This work will ground in general what a metaphorical analysis is and why it is a legitimate subject for philosophical and political inquiry.

Davidson gets this
" According to its Greek etymology, metaphor literally signifies a “carrying over.” And indeed, on the traditional understanding, metaphor is considered to carry a term beyond its original, literal meaning and toward a new, figurative sense (as when we say, for instance, that an idea is over your head). " "In ethical substitution, the self becomes a metaphor in the true sense; the self stands in for another person and substitutes for the other. In short, one becomes the other."

As is well known, metaphor already means etymologically meta-phor, a carrying over. Atlas bearing on his shoulders, a Hermes Thoth stealing away in the
But it's not carrying. It's giving birth. Not Atlas but his mom.

"his would constitute the generative or productive dimension of metaphor. " "And indeed, on the traditional understanding, metaphor is considered to carry a term beyond its original, literal meaning and toward a new, figurative sense "  
 Davidson mentions this but does not notice "instead it brings about the possibility for thought to go beyond what it can think. By leading thought beyond itself, metaphor opens onto what is absolutely other. " Metaphor of birth, midwifery etc
accidentally mentions generative or productive but does not recognize birth
carry to term, baby , child birth, also death, also a word meaning of the said.

The "borrowing from Derrida" is a similar act of midwifery. "Plus de metaphor" indicates the carrying over, that the "plus" is the person of the other, birthed out of the metaphor.

recurrence of thinking -- eg remorse in RPH, rethinking of metaphorics of eating

For example he states "Or do the being encumbered with oneself and the suffering of constriction in one’s skin, BETTER than METAPHORS, follow the exact TROPE of an alteration of essence, which inverts, or would invert, into a recurrence in which the expulsion of self outside of itself is its substitution." Whatever else is going on in this statement -- quite a lot, actually -- it should be noted that even here Levinas is engaging in etymological wordplay, with "metaphor" indicating "carrying over" and thus signalling the phenomenology of "giving birth" and "trope" indicating turning and thus signaling a newly created Other/Self.

New Self is Nietzsche

Birth we encounter Nietzsche, Deleuze, Bergson, Spinoza. Immanence, flux, empiricism. Conatus essendi -- a breath (esse), inspiration. Bergson creative evolution, newness. vital dynamism of elan vital.

The history of philosophy, during some flashes, has known this subjectivity that, as in an extreme youth, breaks with essence. From Plato’s One without being to Husserl’s pure Ego, transcendent in immanence, it has known the metaphysical extraction from being, even if, betrayed by the said, as by the effect of an oracle, the exception restored to the essence and to fate immediately fell back into the rules and led only to worlds behind the scenes. The Nietzschean man above all was such a moment. For Husserl’s transcendental reduction will a putting between parentheses suffice a type of writing, of committing oneself with the world, which sticks like ink to the hands that push it off? One should have to go all the way to the nihilism of Nietzsche’s poetic writing, reversing irreversible time in vortices, to the laughter which refuses language.

Levinas's first translator Alphonso Lingis is of course the first example of such a trickster, of such a great lover of performance and of jokes, of ethical masquerades. Every single Levinas scholar I have ever met has embodied such a performance, a self-parody of their serious self, some like Brian Bergen-Aurand regaling us with jokes, and some like Sol Neely calling out as Trickster.

Derrida refers to this martial language, questioning the very _polemic_ nature of Levinas's criticism of Hegel, accusing him of complicity, "Levinas is very close to Hegel, much closer than he admits, and at the very moment when he is apparently opposed to Hegel in the most radical fashion", calling it "a complicity””between Hegelianism and classical anti-Hegelianism". The war against Hegel never works, because the friend/enemy distinciton is always sublated, thus the opposiiton never gets resolved.

Jacques Derrida "Violence and Metaphysics", 144-6. In _Writing and Difference_ (New York: Routledge, 2005).

> It will be said that Levinas stands opposed to precisely this kind of philosophical discourse. But in this combat, he already has given up the best weapon: disdain of discourse. In effect, when confronted by the classical difficulties of language we are referring to, Levinas cannot provide himself with the classical resources against them. At arms with the problems which were equally the problems of negative theology and of Bergsonism, he does not give himself the right to speak, as they did, in a language resigned to its own failure. Negative theology was spoken in a speech that knew itself failed and finite, inferior to logos as God’s understanding. Above all, negative theology never undertook a Discourse with God in the face to face, and breath to breath, of two free speeches; and this despite the humility and the haughtiness of breaking off, or undertaking, the exchange. Analogously, Bergson had the right to announce the intuition of duration, and to denounce intellectual spatialization, within a language given over to space. It was not a question of saving, but of destroying discourse within “metaphysics,” the science which allegedly does without symbols” (Bergson). Antagonistic metaphors were multiplied systematically in this autodestruction of language which advocated silent metaphysical intuition. Language being defined as a historical residue, there was no contradiction in utilizing it, for better or for worse, in order to denounce its own betrayal, and then to abandon it to its own insufficiency as rhetorical refuse, speech lost to metaphysics. Like negative theology, a philosophy of intuitive communion gave itself the right (correctly or incorrectly, another problem) to travel through philosophical discourse as through a foreign medium. But what happens when this right is no longer given, when the possibility of metaphysics is the possibility of speech? When metaphysical responsibility is responsibility for language, because “thought consists of speaking” (TI), and metaphysics is a language with God? How to think the other, if the other can be spoken only as exteriority and through exteriority, that is, nonalterity? And if the speech which must inaugurate and maintain absolute separation is by its essence rooted in space, which cannot conceive separation and absolute alterity? If, as Levinas says, only discourse (and not intuitive contact) is righteous, and if, moreover, all discourse essentially retains within it space and the Same””does this not mean that discourse is originally violent? And that the philosophical logos, the only one in which peace may be declared, is inhabited by war? The distinction between discourse and violence42 always will be an inaccessible horizon. Nonviolence would be the telos, and not the essence of discourse. Perhaps it will be said that something like discourse has its essence in its telos, and the presence of its present in its future. This certainly is so, but on the condition that its future and its telos be nondiscourse: peace as a certain silence, a certain beyond of speech, a certain possibility, a certain silent horizon of speech. And telos has always had the form of presence, be it a future presence. There is war only after the opening of discourse, and war dies out only at the end of discourse. Peace, like silence, is the strange vocation of a language called outside itself by itself. But since finite silence is also the medium of violence, language can only indefinitely tend toward justice by acknowledging and practicing the violence within it. Violence against violence. Economy of violence. An economy irreducible to what Levinas envisions in the word. If light is the element of violence, one must combat light with a certain other light, in order to avoid the worst violence, the violence of the night which precedes or represses discourse. This vigilance is a violence chosen as the least violence by a philosophy which takes history, that is, finitude, seriously; a philosophy aware of itself as historical in each of its aspects (in a sense which tolerates neither finite totality, nor positive infinity), and aware of itself, as Levinas says in another sense, as economy. But again, an economy which in being history, can be at home neither in the finite totality which Levinas calls the Same nor in the positive presence of the Infinite. Speech is doubtless the first defeat of violence, but paradoxically, violence did not exist before the possibility of speech. The philosopher (man) must speak and write within this war of light, a war in which he always already knows himself to be engaged; a war which he knows is inescapable, except by denying discourse, that is, by risking the worst violence. This is why this avowal of the war within discourse, an avowal which is not yet peace, signifies the opposite of bellicosity; the bellicosity””and who has shown this better than Hegel?””whose best accomplice within history is irenics. Within history which the philosopher cannot escape, because it is not history in the sense given to it by Levinas (totality), but is the history of the departures from totality, history as the very movement of transcendence, of the excess over the totality without which no totality would appear as such. History is not the totality transcended by eschatology, metaphysics, or speech. It is transcendence itself. If speech is a movement of metaphysical transcendence, it is history, and not beyond history. It is difficult to think the origin of history in a perfectly finite totality (the Same), as well as, moreover, in a perfectly positive infinity. If, in this sense, the movement of metaphysical transcendence is history, it is still violent, for””and this is the legitimate truism from which Levinas always draws inspiration””history is violence. Metaphysics is economy: violence against violence, light against light: philosophy (in general). About which it can be said, by transposing Claudel’s intention, that everything in it “is painted on light as if with condensed light, like the air which becomes frost.” This becoming is war. This polemic is language itself. Its inscription.

Blanchot's observation of the "ex" occurs after this statement, of "exist", "exodus", "exile", "experience", "exigency", "extending", "extreme", "excluded", "exercise", "exterior"

Blanchot, 125-7

> When in his turn Pasternak asks “What does being Jewish signify? Why does it exist?” I believe that among all the responses there is one in three parts that we cannot avoid choosing, and it is this: it exists so the idea of exodus and the idea of exile can exist as a legitimate movement; it exists, through exile and through the initiative that is exodus, so that the experience of strangeness may affirm itself close at hand as an irreducible relation; it exists so that, by the authority of this experience, we might learn to speak.
> Reflection and history enlighten us on the first point with a painful evidency. If Judaism is destined to take on meaning for us, it is indeed by showing that, at whatever time, one must be ready to set out, because to go out (to step outside) is the exigency from which one cannot escape if one wants to maintain the possibility of a just relation. The exigency of uprooting; the affirmation of nomadic truth. In this Judaism stands in contrast to paganism (all paganism). To be pagan is to be fixed, to plant oneself in the earth, as it were, to establish oneself through a pact with the permanence that authorizes sojourn and is certified by certainty in the land. Nomadism answers to a relation that possession cannot satisfy. Each time Jewish man makes a sign to us across history it is by the summons of a movement. Happily established in Sumerian civilization, Abraham at a certain point breaks with that civilization and renounces dwelling there. Later, the Jewish people become a people through the exodus. And where does this night of exodus, renewed from year to year, each time lead them? To a place that is not a place and where it is not possible to reside. The desert makes of the slaves of Egypt a people, but a people without a land and bound by a word. Later, the exodus becomes the exile that is accompanied by all the trials of a hunted existence, establishing in each heart anxiety, insecurity, affliction, and hope. But this exile, heavy as it is, is not only recognized as being an incomprehensible malediction. There is a truth of exile and there is a vocation of exile; and if being Jewish is being destined to dispersion-just as it is a call to a sojourn without place, just as it ruins every fixed relation of force with one individual, one group, or one state””it is because dispersion, faced with the exigency of the whole, also clears the way for a different exigency and finally forbids the temptation of Unity-Identity.
> Andre Neher recalls these stages of Jewish presence (the presence of a nonpresence) in one of his books. First of all, of course, the Jew has the right to the name Jew (I know none more worthy of being claimed); but one must not forget that before being Jewish the Jew was an Israelite, that before being an Israelite he was a Hebrew (today becoming an Israeli), and that to be Jewish is thus to bear without bending the weight and the fullness of all these names. Here I will rapidly take up again Andre Neher’s remarks.2 The Jewish man is the Hebrew when he is the man of origins. The origin is a decision; this is the decision of Abraham, separating himself from what is, and affirming himself as a foreigner in order to answer to a foreign truth. The Hebrew passes from one world (the established Sumerian world) to something that is “not yet a world” and is nonetheless this world here below; a ferryman, the Hebrew Abraham invites us not only to pass from one shore to the other, but also to carry ourselves to wherever there is a passage to be made, maintaining this between-two-shores that is the truth of passage. It must be added that if this memorial of the origin that comes to us from so venerable a past is certainly enveloped in mystery, it has nothing of the mythical about it. Abraham is fully a man; a man who sets off and who, by this first departure, founds the human right to beginning, the only true creation. A beginning that is entrusted and passed on to each of us but that, in extending itself, loses its simplicity. The Hebrew himself will not remain Hebrew. The relation with the Unknown one can know only by way of distance, through migration and march, becomes, with the filing out of Jabbok and in the night of Penuel, enigmatic contact: the struggle about which one knows nothing since what is at stake is the truth of the night, that which is not to be retained when day breaks. Jacob runs headlong into the inaccessible outside whose partner he becomes, struggling not to overcome it, but to receive it in the very night of the word that he firmly stands up to until the moment when it comes to him as benediction. Thus marked, the Hebrew, becoming Israel, becomes the one who is not like the others; election is an alteration. The one who is subject to the brusque interpolation of the Foreign, the one who is responsible for the ambiguous choice that sets him apart, is at the mercy of this strangeness that he risks making into a power, a privilege, a kingdom, and a State. Israel’s solitude””a sacerdotal, a ritual, and also a social solitude””comes not only from the passions of the men who live adjacent to it, but also from this particular relation with itself that placed this extreme, infinite distance, the presence that is other, in its proximity. Thus is born the Jew. The Jew is the man of origins; he who relates to the origin not by dwelling but by distancing himself from it, thus saying that the truth of the beginning is in separation. Israelite, he is in the Kingdom. Jew, he is in Exile, and is as though destined to make of exile a kingdom. Andre Neher says: “How can one be in Exile and inthe Kingdom, at the same time vagabond and established? It is precisely this contradiction that makes the Jewish man a Jew.” (A contradiction that Neher is perhaps too inclined to translate into dialectical terms, whereas it signifies a contrariety for which dialectics is unable to account.)
> Let us insist now upon a single point. The words exodus, exile””as well as those heard by Abraham, “Leave your country, your kinsmen, your father’s house”-bear a meaning that is not negative. If one must set out on the road and wander, is it because, being excluded from the truth, we are condemned to the exclusion that prohibits all dwelling? Or would not this errancy rather signify a new relation with “truth”? Doesn’t this nomadic movement (wherein is inscribed the idea of division and separation) affirm itself not as the eternal privation of a sojourn, but rather as an authentic manner of residing, of a residence that does not bind us to the determination of place or to settling close to a reality forever and already founded, sure, and permanent? As though the sedentary state were necessarily the aim of every action! As though truth itself were necessarily sedentary!

> Does not lucidity, the mind’s openness upon the true, consist in catching sight of the permanent possibility of war? The state of war suspends morality; it divests the eternal institutions and obligations of their eternity and rescinds ad interim the unconditional imperatives. In advance its shadow falls over the actions of men. War is not only one of the ordeals “” the greatest “” of which morality lives; it renders morality derisory. The art of foreseeing war and of winning it by every means “” politics “” is henceforth enjoined as the very exercise of reason. Politics is opposed to morality, as philosophy to naivete. We do not need obscure fragments of Heraclitus to prove that being reveals itself as war to philosophical thought, that war does not only affect it as the most patent fact, but as the very patency, or the truth, of the real. In war reality rends the words and images that dissimulate it, to obtrude in its nudity and in its harshness. Harsh reality ( this sounds like a pleonasm!), harsh object-lesson, at the very moment of its figuration when the drapings of illusion burn war is produced as the pure experience of pure being. The ontological event that takes form in this black light is a casting into movement of beings hitherto anchored in their identity, a mobilization of absolutes, by an objective order from which there is no escape. The trial by force is the test of the real. But violence does not consist so much in injuring and annihilating persons as in interrupting their continuity, making them play roles in which they no longer recognize themselves, making them betray not only commitments but their own substance, making them carry out actions that will destroy every possibility for action. Not only modern war but every war employs arms that turn against those who wield them. It establishes an order from which no one can keep his distance; nothing henceforth is exterior. War does not manifest exteriority and the other as other; it destroys the identity of the same.

Hegel's "totality", Aristotle plastic form and matter, Nietzsche's poetic "plastic":

> The visage of being that shows itself in war is fixed in the concept of totality, which dominates Western philosophy. Individuals are reduced to being bearers of forces that command them unbeknown to themselves. The meaning of individuals (invisible outside of this totality) is derived from the totality. The unicity of each present is incessantly sacrificed to a future appealed to to bring forth its objective meaning. For the ultimate meaning alone counts; the last act alone changes beings into themselves. They are what they will appear to be in the already plastic forms of the epic.

Nietzsche's "mocking gaze", Marx's alienation:

> The moral consciousness can sustain the mocking gaze of the political man only if the certitude of peace dominates the evidence of war. Such a certitude is not obtained by a simple play of antitheses. The peace of empires issued from war rests on war. It does not restore to the alienated beings their lost identity. For that a primordial and original relation with being is needed.

> The history of philosophy, during some flashes, has known this subjectivity that, as in an extreme youth, breaks with essence. From Plato’s One without being to Husserl’s pure Ego, transcendent in immanence, it has known the metaphysical extraction from being, even if, betrayed by the said, as by the effect of an oracle, the exception restored to the essence and to fate immediately fell back into the rules and led only to worlds behind the scenes. The Nietzschean man above all was such a moment. For Husserl’s transcendental reduction will a putting between parentheses suffice - a type of writing (Derrida), of committing oneself with the world, which sticks like ink to the hands that push it off? One should have to go all the way to the nihilism of Nietzsche’s poetic writing, reversing irreversible time in vortices, to the laughter which refuses language" Otherwise than Being.

The inverse of language is like a laughter that seeks to destroy language, a laughter infinitely reverberated where mystification interlocks in mystification without ever resting on a real speech, without ever commencing. The spectacle of the silent world of facts is bewitched: every phenomenon masks, mystifies ad infinitum, making actuality impossible. It is the situation created by those derisive beings communicating across a labyrinth of innuendos which Shakespeare and Goethe have appear in their scenes of sorcerers where speech is antilanguage and where to respond
would be to cover oneself with riditule.

> Thales, the founder of this school of philosophy, says the permanent entity is water (which is why he also propounded that the earth floats on water). Presumably he derived this assumption from seeing that the nutriment of everything is moist, and that heat itself is generated from moisture and depends upon it for its existence (and that from which a thing is generated is always its first principle). He derived his assumption from this; and also from the fact that the seeds of everything have a moist nature, whereas water is the first principle of the nature of moist things.
