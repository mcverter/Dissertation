# Chapter Four: Oikonomos


Against the logic of the neuter
and
Engendering in Totality and Infinity


The intended focus of this chapter is "political economy", reread in a feminist, Levinasian, anarchist manner. The paragraphs are perhaps a bit too wide-ranging so I am making the focus explicit in this sentence.

We commence with our previous chapter's invitation to consider Levinas's metaphorics as a way to think through the alternatives to patriarchy. In this chapter, we start by tracing out the dimensions of what Levinas variously describes as "maternity", from his first book in which he describes the home as the sphere of welcome and nurturance to his second book in which he specifies the essential orientation of the ethical self as a "maternity". I will try to do several things in this first section: first of all I will be speaking directly to Levinas scholarship, attempting to unravel numerous longstanding issues, including what is the relationship between his first book and his second book, and how to deal with the apparently sexist implications of Levinas's apparent reification of the feminine. Merely unraveling how Levinas transforms the metaphorics of maternity between the two books will be very important for Levinas scholarship -- most analyses never cover this ground because the topic is too politically dangerous and because tracing his conceptuality is generally difficult. Secondly, walking through Levinas's analysis is important because he does an excellent job of mapping the conceptual terrain, of connecting "the feminine" with coordinate concepts such as the problematic of consumption and of domesticity. Whether or not these conceptual linkages is socially constructed -- and most writing on Levinas has focused on this type of thing, criticising him for allegedly claiming that domesticity is essentially femininie -- these concepts have been coordinated within philosophy and within culture so they are worth analysing. Only through such a reading can we hope subvert, invert, and pervert the conceptual architecture of patriarchy.

Our interrogation of patriarchal conceptualization begins at the source of philosophy itself, in the Greek text, looking at the distinction between two forms of sociality, the _polis_ and the _oikos_. Nancy Hartsock sent me the prospectus for her proposed book on "The Barracks Community" before she passed away in which she traces an itinerary that encompasses Homer, Aeschylus, Plato, Aristotle, and Aristophanes. Perhaps I will attempt to retrace the steps she describes in her outline -- her papers are archived at Brown University in Providence so I will at least contact the collection there.

In previous work, I have independently looked through Aristotle's Politics to investigate his notion of the _oikos_ or household. Aristotle offers two definitions of the _oikos_ in this text: (1) the field where the patriarch establishes his private sphere of domination over children, women and animals and (2) the place in which human needs are fulfilled. Why does Aristotle think that human needs require domination and how does his intuition inform Western thought and culture, especially the way we structure the political in relation to the social?

I have written a lot about the importance of “consumption” in Levinas ever since my 1995 undergraduate thesis on the metaphorics of vision and power, concluding that maybe I should have reflected instead on eating and consumption. I explored the further in earnest in my master's thesis "Self and Property", which traced the conceptions of selfhood and property ownership alongside ideas about production and consumption in Locke, Hegel, and Levinas. In general, all of the modes of orality are interesting in Levinas's text, including eating, speaking, laughing, breathing, and vomiting. The metaphorics of eating are omnipresent in Levinas's work, from his explicit discussion of eating as the action of incorporation that constitutes the self as a bodily materiality to his later exemplification of the ethical as taking the bread out of one's own mouth to deliver it to the other. I have written in depth about Levinas's metaphorics of "breathing", exploring the way that we are all constituted by the oxygen that we share with each other. Levinas's references to laughter are often winks at Nietzsche or similiar moments of ecstasy (eg the witches of Macbeth) so might not be appropriate here, and I may bring in vomiting later in the tenth chapter on revolution. In any case, the key takeaway here is that selfhood and otherness is constituted by what they consume not by what they produce. Both self and other do indeed labor and produce works, but these works are immediately alienated from the producer and delivered over to the realm of public generality where they can serve as fuel for human consumption. One can try to deduce the living person from the dead husk of materiality and indeed social justice often requires that we do exactly this work.

The focus on comsumption will allow us to insist on the priority of human needs as a political goal. This is a theme that is often discussed by anarchocommunists such as Kropoktin, and I believe I have discussed this in other work. Deva Woodly also brought up this topic as an important theme in Black Feminism so I hope to follow up on whatever suggestions she might have. The thematic of "need" also has an interesting history within the work of philsophy. Throughout the history of philsophy, 'need' has been a deprecated category, a lack either to be overcome or to be resisted. Since the 60s, "desire" has become an important idea in radical thought, especially in a politically important writer like Deleuze who employs the term "desiring machine" in the sense of a non-human, even anti-human, drive, melding Nietzsche's conception of a Will-to-Power with the dynamism of early empiricism. However, these thematics of "desire" are typically offered as an active, masculine impetus in constrast to the deprecated category of need. I believe that Nussbaum and Sen have an interesting analysis of the importance of need, which I have never looked at and know only by reputaiton.

The thematics of home also offer a lot of grounds for exploratoin. I have written papers for Simon Critchley and Nancy Frazer on these topics but am unfortunately lost these papers. The paper for Frazer was on Nancy Folbre's "The Invisible Heart", a book which discusses the importance of feminine reproductive labor and how it should be made central to our analysis of political economy. Frazer loved this paper and I think it even influenced her department's hiring decision. My paper for Simon was on Heidegger's usage of the language of "Heimat" and was probably about the creepy nationalism, implicit nationalism, and incipient eco-fascism inherent in his meditations on the home and one's enrootedness in the ground of being. I can perhaps try to recreate this work to bring out the risks of investing too much in these ideas, but I don't care that much about writing an anti-Heidegger screed, which is the terrain of to much Levinas literature. I have also written a few conference papers about the idea of "home" in the black feminist writings of bell hooks, and I know that Deva Woodly brought this up in her talk so I can ask her about it. I know that there is also a lineage of reflection within Italian feminism regarding domestic labor, starting with James and Dalla Costa. Silvia Federici's "Caliban and the Witch" might also be interesting here.

There are various ways that we can bring Marx into the discussion here too. I have already done so in the discussion above. The entire discussion of consumption and production openly touches upon Marx. That is, the products of labor are always/already alienated from the producer and one is always consuming the dead discarded husks of the living labor of the past. I am indeed emphasizing consumption over production but that does not necessarily negate Marx's work, and in fact I am deliberately emphasizing the linkage between death and production (this association is not frequently discussed in Levinas studies) in order to refer back to the way that Marx discusses "dead capital" in comparison to "living labor" and how he describes capitalism itself as a form of "living labor". Within Totality and Infinity, Levinas includes a section on Commerce and discusses money as a universal and impersonal medium, which definitely sounds like a reference to Marx's analysis of the General Value Form. I can also discourse on how not only Marx's ideas of productive labor and capital relate to Levinas but, in a general way, how finance capital relate to Levinas (I have not read the volumes of Capital on this suject). Levinas repeatedly discusses how the one's existence in the present is always shadowed by a "concern for the morrow" and we have illuminated that one's relation to existence is fundamentally a material and embodied one, so we can appreciate the concepts of investment and risk in these terms, as an attempt to ensure the endurance of one's substatiantiality, of one's sustenance through future, and we can compare the finance capital mode of relating to the future with other possible ways of orienting oneself.
