Marie kondo ruined my life:  
*                     (g) Does it spark joy? As a way of ridding yourself of the past
*                     (h) I had forsaken academia because I no longer believed it
*                     (i) Every acadmic I have known, from graduate student to department chair is consumed with anxious careerism.  Academia exists to uphold a certain class structure. It always has – the Confucians at least admitted as such: education was a prerequisite to government office.  Our university system, created out of the monastery system, further warped by neoliberal capitalism, has always servced to preserve and promote a certain caste, whether the professional-managerial class or the investment capitalist class
*                     (j) “do I love this” – threw away old work, forsook my past
*                     (k) I am no longer doing philosophjy so I threw out many papers I had worked long and hard on
*                     (l) Now I find myself tryng to reconstruct that work
*                     (m) The other who was me in 2016 believed that they could discard an even further past, and now me in the present, the future of that past, am forlorn.
