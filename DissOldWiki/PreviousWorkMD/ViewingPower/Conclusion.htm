        >� The trajectory from Descartes to Levinas charts a profound
        transformation in man�s consumer relationship to a developing commodity
        economy.� Descartes writes at a period which marks the beginning not
        only of modern thought, but also of bourgeois capitalism.� Descartes�
        description of himself figures him as almost the paradigmatic bourgeois
        consumer.� Descartes sits down at his desk, calm and clear-headed,
        relaxing in the complacency of his home, to write his
        <u>Meditations on First Philosophy</u>.� From this space of comfort,
        Descartes looks out at a threatening world filled with possible
        uncertainty and insecurity.� In response, he attempts to preserve this
        security by domesticating exteriority.� Descartes masters the external
        world by positing it as a set of objects which offer themselves to him
        for his contemplation.� He does not figure his consciousness as a
        <i>tabula rasa</i>, reacting to new, unexpected sense-data.� Rather,
        Descartes sets a table for himself with morsels which offer themselves
        for his consumption and domination.

        ����������� Nietzsche�s and Heidegger�s works express their distrust and
        disdain of this consumerist position.�� Both of them warn that
        Descartes� spectatorial paradigm constitutes a cowardly retreat from
        life and its contingencies.�� Heidegger explains that mass culture
        submerges and loses Dasein by transforming its authentic possibilities
        into exchangeable and consumable commodities.� Nietzsche contends that
        society effeminizes the individual, making him unable to assert his
        sovereign will-to-power.� Both of them overcome their anxiety over
        modern economic circumstances by developing an anxiety over an
        underlying abyss.� They assert that, by confronting the limits of one�s
        own existence, one can find one�s will to take risks, no matter what
        outcome fate may destine.� In response to the flaccidity and passivity
        of modern selfhood, Nietzsche and Heidegger affirm the importance of
        creative, heroic individuals, of tragic artists and poetic builders.� By
        doing so, both of them try to oppose the dominant consumerist
        subjectivity with a productive subjectivity.� Nietzsche�s argues that
        the self should assert its will to power by producing new perspectives
        and creating new poetic visions.� By developing a concept of possibility
        which can not be reduced to actuality, Heidegger establishes a process
        of perpetual production which can not be reduced simply to the
        commodities it produces.� Furthermore, Heidegger�s Dasein confronts its
        world as entity which it can manipulate to promote its own possibilities
        like the solitary capitalist entrepreneur who exploits reality in the
        name of free enterprise.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""

        ����������� Before discussing how Levinas� works relate to consumer
        capitalism, I would like to meditate on what his work describes.�
        Although Levinas is an ethical thinker, we must be precise about what
        this term means for him.� Levinas is not a thinker of morals or
        virtues.�� He does not � at least, not explicitly � prescribe any
        specific behaviors or attitudes.� Furthermore, he does not furnish us
        with the equivalent of a Kantian imperatives; he does not give us ground
        rules for moral laws.� Instead, I would argue that Levinas� project in
        <u>Totality and Infinity</u> is quite similar to Heidegger�s project of
        constructing a ontological phenomenology in <u>Being and Time</u>.�
        Although the terminology often seems cryptic and the sentences often
        become dizzying, Levinas intends to describe the exact structures of our
        everyday empirical existence.�
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 24pt;">
        &nbsp;
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 24pt;">
        ����������� Levinas� philosophy attempts to radically reorient my
        conception of my life.� Rather than letting me think of myself as an
        independent, autonomous entity, Levinas wrenches the center of my life
        outside of myself.� Levinas teaches me just how radically I, at every
        moment of my life, am radically exposed to the wills of other people.�
        The Other always maintains the capacity to shock me in both delightful
        and horrifying ways.� My openness to the Other explains why I can not
        shut out another person�s suffering, even if I choose to ignore it.�
        Conversely, this exposure also enables another person to invade my
        privacy in order to harm me.� By orienting me towards ethics, Levinas
        does not necessarily make me act �better� in the conventional sense.�
        Rather, he demonstrates how my interactions with others � and even my
        relationship with myself as one who transubstantiates into an Other over
        time � will always disrupt my self-assertive will.�� The Other confronts
        me as a person whose actions I can�t fully predict and whose statements
        I can�t completely control, yet whose commitments and words directly
        affect me.� Furthermore, the Other seizes my destiny away from myself
        because he always takes over my projects and my works at the very moment
        that I project and produce them.�� Therefore, Levinas demonstrates that,
        in this post modern age of The Rapture, control will always slip out of
        our grasp and our will will always be violated by others.

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 24pt;">
        ����������� Like Marx, Levinas� works meditate on the irreducible
        materiality of the human condition and on the need for economic
        justice.� <u>Totality and Infinity</u> always brings the reader back to
        a contemplation of the incarnate nature of existence, showing how our
        transformations from one moment to another are always resurrections of
        the <i>flesh</i>.�� Furthermore, this book always makes me contemplate
        how my discourse, my <i>commerce,</i> with others always occurs through
        the economic relationships I establish with them and with myself.� In
        his discussions of enjoyment, Levinas consistently praises Marx for
        recognizing the fundamental sincerity of man�s material desires.�
        Describing life as alimentation, as eating, Levinas� analysis of
        enjoyment grounds my existence in my consumerism.� Rather than viewing
        the world as possibilities I can seize, I ground my existence on my
        sensual enjoyment of the objects I consume.� Levinas cites Theophile
        Gautier�s assertion, �I am one of those people for whom the external
        world exists.�<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 24pt;">
        ����������� Levinas� ideas can be applied to think through concrete
        phenomena which we encounter in our contemporary consumerist economy.�
        For example, Levinas explains that the Other retains his transcendence
        through his infinite capacity to clarify the image he presents.�
        Although he may manifest a particular facade at one moment, the Other
        can always present a completely different one in a new moment.� The
        infinity of temporality allows the Other to create himself anew in a
        form which I never could have anticipated.� This description, I would
        argue, can give us a phenomenology of Madonna, the post-modern person
        <i>par excellance</i>.� Doesn�t Madonna�s constitute her �identity�
        precisely on her infinite capacity to recreate herself from one album to
        another, from the Boy Toy of <i>Borderline</i>, to the seductress of
        <i>Like a Virgin</i>, to the sophisticated vamp of <i>Vogue</i>?�
        Similarly, Levinas explains that one establishes oneself in the moment
        by positing oneself as a concrete work.� By manifesting oneself in the
        public world, one creates oneself as a consumable object.� Again,
        doesn�t Madonna�s �power� derive precisely from her infinite ability to
        exploit herself, her infinite capacity to control her own
        commodification?

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in; line-height: 24pt;">
        ����������� More importantly, Levinas� analysis can also lend itself to
        a new critique of the consumerist economy.� The anarchist Raoul
        Vaneigem, in his <u>Revolution of Everyday Life</u> critiques
        consumerism in, as the title suggests, a Heideggerian manner.� He argues
        that modern society forces us into a survival mentality in which we
        merely consume goods rather exploring and exerting our creative wills.<a

        >� Conversely, Levinas can help us to develop an an-archism of the other
        man.� For Levinas, survival connotes a literal �living over,� an
        existence which lives off of those who have been slaughtered by
        history.� Levinas explains that the self�s enjoyment derives through its
        concretization and incorporation of the elemental as objects for its
        bodily consumption.� Furthermore, Levinas explains that this elemental
        enjoyment is produced from the materiality of the works it has inherited
        from the past, from the human suffering and death which has congealed
        itself in the production of a work.� Levinas updates Marx�s analysis of
        capitalism as vampirism, Marx�s descriptions of the machinery of
        production sucking the life out of the bodies it consumes in
        production.� He draws our attention to the fact that, in an era where
        all dresses are made from the blood of children and all overcoats are
        made from human hair, the everyday of consumption implicates the
        consumer in profound violence.�

        ����������� Perhaps we can use Levinas to develop a phenomenology of
        social protest.� The Other presents me with a being who �burns without
        being consumed,� whose humanity can not be fully absorbed by a consumer
        economy, yet whose epiphany also teaches me the possibility of a
        holocaust.� Levinas figures me as someone who is profoundly aware of
        human suffering, even if I choose to ignore this degradation.�
        Furthermore, in his later works, he repeatedly explains that the
        material needs of the Other are my own spiritual needs.� The Other calls
        me away from my complacent comfort, demanding that I work to promote
        social and economic justice.� Levinas describes ways in which I can
        confront systems of oppression.� He explains that my freedom does not
        derive from my ability to exert my will, but rather from an awareness
        that anonymous powers always threaten to crush my freedom.� Although
        outside powers can indeed control me and objectify me, I always maintain
        the infinite capacity to speak to the Other.� Like Abraham who argues
        desperately against God�s destruction of Sodom and Gomorra, I retain the
        infinite ability and duty to bear witness to the suffering of myself and
        the Other and to speak out against the concrete facts which oppress us.�
