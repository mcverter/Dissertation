I
    ha\'e spent my entire adult life engaged in a quest to understand not just
    who I am but how creatures like me came to be. That humans evolved at all
    is a fluke . My own existence, like that of any other person's, is more than a
fluke-it is a miracle. Out of the seven million or so egg cells my mother was
born with, it was mine that ripened to be fertilized by my father. Against the
usual odds, that fetus survived the vagaries of gestation to be born . And what
about this creature, this person I would become? What does it mean to be
born a mammal, with an emotional legacy that makes me capable of caring
for others, breeding with the ovaries of a primate, possessing the mind of a
human being?What does it mean for a woman to have descended from ances­
tors who spent the Pleistocene (the time span between 1.6 million and ten
thousand years ago) trying to gather enough food to stay fed and also obtain
enough help from others so that her offspring would survive and prosper?
What does it mean to be all these things embodied in one ambitious woman?
To be a semicontinuously sexually receptive, hairless biped, filled with con­
flicting aspirations and struggling to maintain her balance in a rapidly chang­
ing world?
    For better or for worse, I see the world through a different lens than most
people. My depth of field is millions of years longer, and the subjects in my
viewfinder have the curious habit of spontaneously taking on the attributes of
other species: chimps, platypuses, australopithecines. This habit of thinking
about mothers in broad evolutionary and comparative-as well as cross­
cultural and historical-perspectives distinguishes my examination of moth­
erhood from those of the psychoanalysts, psychologists, novelists, poets, and
social historians whose work I build on.
    I am trained in anthropology, primatology, and evolutiopary theory. I
entered graduate school in     r 970  at a time when Harvard was still a very
male-centered institution, especially in the sciences . Nor was it then fashion­
able, as it has since become, to focus on the active role of mothers in evolu­
tionary processes. During the years of my education and early career, the
genderscape of the natural sciences was transformed by a broader inclusion
of women. With their involvement came new emphases and new topics of
study. Just a century before, the only women writing about evolution were

nm·clists or commentators on the outer edges of the scientific community,
with no impact on mainstream theory. Today that situation has changed.
    E\·en more unlikely than being born, the accident of when and to which
family I was horn meant that I ended up among the fraction of human females
ever permitted the kind of education and opportunities to do research tra­
ditionally reserved for men. I had uncommon opportunities to travel, to
observe all types of primates in the habitats in which they evolved, and to
enter previously all-male scientific domains. Because I wanted to be a mother
as well as a scientist, this meant making compromises. But I was never forced
to make the really big compromise, to choose between my aspirations and the
rewards of marriage, pregnancy, giving birth, and the satisfaction of watching
my children become remarkable people in their own right. I owe this luxury
to the availability of an unprecedented degree of reproductive choice, espe­
cially in the realm of birth control. I could delay the birth of my first child
until after my doctoral thesis was published. After the birth of my second
child, I could still continue to do research, although it meant giving up field­
·work and turning to topics I could study closer to home. In the case of my last
child, I could postpone his birth until after I was forty, confident that genetic
screening and, if necessary, an early abortion would protect my family from
the liability of aging ovaries.
    My melding of vocation with family has been supported by a steadfast
partner, resilient children, and the generous hearts of alloparents-all the
individuals other than me and my husband who helped us rear our children.
As I would learn, mothers have worked for as long as our species has existed,
and they have depended on others to help them rear their children.
    Like many humans today, I was reared quite differently from the primates
I observed in the field. Unlike the mothers in every other ape species, my
own mother had no interest in carry ing me every where she went. Indeed, in
the particular tribe of elite Texans into which I was born, the custom of
mothers nurturing their own infants had been lost generations before.
My mother delegated the care of her infants to others, just as both my grand­
mothers had done.
    My mother's idea of good management was that if a child became too
attached to a nanny, it was time to hire a new one, lest maternal control he
diminished. T his meant that I was 1·cared hy a succession of governesses. No
one ever doubted that my mother loved her five children. She was under the
impression that infants might be born of inferior or superior "stock" (like all
                                    PREFACE                                    xiii
southerners, she was fascinated by family lines), but like most college­
educated women of her time, she also believed that babies were blank slates,
conditioned to act as they were trained to.
     I was born in r 946. It was not until several decades later that the writings
of the British medical doctor and psychoanalyst john Bowlby began to change
the way educated p eople thought about the needs of children. Bowlby
demonstrated that babies are genetically programmed to seek and form an
attachment to a trusted figure. Secure attachment to one or more trusted
caretakers is an essential aspect of emotional development in humans, just as
it is in all other primates.
     Along with several recent revisions to "attachment theory," Bowlby's ideas
will stand among the greatest contributions made by evolutionary-minded
psychologists to human well-being. But Bowlby's insights also produce a
series of new-often seemingly irreconcilable-dilemmas for mothers who
want to rear emotionally healthy, self-confident children, but who also want
lives or careers of their own.
     Both pre- and post-Bowlby, a woman's maternal emotions (those con­
cerned with producing and nurturing offspring and keeping them alive) con­
tinued to be viewed as separate from and even antithetical to the rest of
her-her sexuality and, particularly, her ambition. Yet the compartmental­
ized way we have learned to think about these emotions has nothing to do
with how they evolved.
     Such thoughts were far from my conscious mind when, years ago, I found
myself in the throes of cyclically experienced sexual feelings. At that time,
such restless yearnings were still a largely unacknowledged primate legacy.
Indeed, in some circles such feelings were assumed not even to exist in
women. Hence I had no framework for interpreting them. I found myself
attracted to some men more than others for reasons that I did not under­
stand. Eventually I fell in love (almost from the moment I first set eyes on him
in a course, ironically enough, on "fossil man") with a fellow anthropologist.
Even though nothing could have been further from my conscious thoughts,
he \Vould prove to be a wonderful and very committed father. Yet, at that
point, I had no idea how inextricably linked sexual and maternal emotions
have been in the course of primate evolution.
     When we finally decided that it was a "good enough" time to have chil­
dren, alii can remember was wanting a daughter and how wonderful it was
to be pregnant. Even "doing nothing," I felt creative. Odd as this may sound to
xiv                                 PREFACE
some, birth, too, was a euphoric experience, the pain far more nearly fasci­
nating than unbearable. For me, contractions during labor were an opportu­
nity to find out what it feels like to be totally in the grips of all-encompassing
biological forces over which my conscious mind had no say. Thinking back to
my first glimpse of the slimy creature who emerged head first, luscious is the
word that comes to mind to describe the daughter of my dreams. I was
stunned by the sensual responses she evoked in me. I made up love songs cel­
ebrating each beautiful feature, her soft skin and silky hair.
    After the first weeks of living with a baby girl who mostly slept or quietly
nursed through seminars, it became increasingly apparent that in the world I
lived in, caring for a baby was incompatible with concentrated work. A new
baby's terrifying vulnerability, the magnitude of the responsibility, and the
insatiable demands that kept me on-call twenty-four hours a day, came as a
shock. Yet, as a primatologist in the post-Bowlby era, what could I do but turn
my life over to her?
    I was overwhelmed by contradictory impulses, trapped if I did, damned if
I didn't. Not the least of the emotions that bubbled up was a whirring resent­
ment-the kind I identify with the most primitive portions of my brain­
toward my daughter's father, by then a medical doctor and infectious-disease
researcher who could go off and spend long hours in the lab while I tried to
eke out of the daily interruptions enough time to write. I wanted him to
invest more, so that I could be free. Yet if I delegated care to others, wouldn't
this mean reverting to the ways of my mother's generation, before we under­
stood the attachment needs of infants?
    I so desperately wanted to succeed in my c hosen profession; yet I didn't
want to deprive my daughter of the emotional security I had become con­
vinced she needed. Personal ambition seemed to be on a collision course
with my baby's needs. At that time I had no idea how interrelated maternal
and professional aspirations actually are.
    From recent surveys, I now know that the kind of ambivalence I felt is
experienced to varying degrees by most mothers in the United States. Work­
ing mothers feel more ambivalence than mothers who stay home with their
children. Mothers who work by choice feel more conflicted than those who
must work to support their family. 1 Still, the bottom line is: the majority of
mothers with preschool-age infants are now working outside the home. W ith
ongoing changes in the welfare system, that proportion is growing even
higher.
                                    PREFACE                                   XV
    Always, in the hack of my own mind, lurked nagging questions. Did the
ambivalence I felt mean that I was a bad mother? Would my success come at
the emotional expense of my children? Even y ears later, when my oldest
daughter called home her first week in college to say she wasn't sure she
belonged there-probably not an unusual response-reflexively I recalled
the miserable, distorted face of a diapcrlcss toddler standing outside a bunga­
low in Rajasthan, India. She was a little girl suffering from a virulent diaper
rash in a far-off land, where women with dots on their foreheads or veils
across their faces must have seemed very strange. Yet the familiar figure of her
mother would not return till evening. Even more painfully vivid was my six­
week return to India when she stayed home with her father and a house­
keeper. I still recall every intonation of her voice on the other end of the
phone when I landed in New York and called home. "Ma-ma" came the heart­
breaking cr y , with no trace of resentment.
    But I've ne,·er been content to agonize when I could analy ze instead. I set
out to use every perspective at my command, and every source of informa­
tion I could locate, to marshal such evidence as I could bring to bear on the
question of what it means to be a mother, and what human infants need from
their mothers, and why. Even what I failed to learn in time to help me rear my
own three children, I could pass on to others.
    I was driven to understand my past. For we are not ready -made out of
somebody's r ib. We are composites of many different legacies, put together
from leftovers in an evolutionary process that has been going on for billions
of y ears. Even the endorphins that made my labor pains tolerable came from
molecules that humans still share with earthworms.
    But I am jumping ahead of my story. At the outset, it would never have
occurred to me to articulate the nature of my quest to understand maternal
ambivalence, female sexuality, and infant needs in these terms. It was not
until college that I learned about evolution. To my amazement, people actu­
ally studied the behavior of other animals to learn more about human nature.
    In 1 968 I was taking an undergraduate course in college given by Irven
DeVore, one of the pioneers in the then-fledgling field of primatology. One
day he mentioned a report by Japanese primatologists working in India that
described bizarre behavior among adult male langurs, a species of monkey I
had never heard of. According to the report, these males would grab infants
from their mothers and bite them to death. Mothers would fight to keep their
infants safe but, in the end, fail. On rare occasions-as I later confirmed-

                                           they appeared not even to try to
                                           defend them. The bereaved moth­
                                           ers seemingly did not even bear a
                                           grudge. After the male killed her
                                           infant, the langur mother mated
                                           with him, which struck me as unac­
                                           countably odd.
                                                I had just learned that creatures
                                           evolved so as to enhance their re­
productive success. But now I was confronted with a description of males
killing infants with more than a hint of maternal collusion-behavior that
decreased rather than increased infant survival. I was more than intrigued.
After graduating from college, I went to India to learn why such strange
behavior occurred.
    Studying infanticide in other primates turned out to be only the beginning
of my quest to understand female nature and motherhood in particular. This
quest lured me to do research in seven countries over thirty years, drawing
on extremely unlikely sources of information--last wills and testaments,
documents from foundling homes, folktales, even the pages of phone
books-in my effort to learn about parental attitudes in my own species.
Along the way, I have come to understand just how flexible parental emotions
in humans can be. Whatever maternal instincts are, they are not automatic in
the sense that most people usc that term. Most important, I have learned that
even though the worl<l has undergone immense changes since our ancestors
lived by foraging, many of the basic outlines of the dilemmas mothers con­
front remain remarkahly constant.
For a billion years, ever since egg- and sperm-producing organisms first
arose, the genetic futures of males (the "sperm-producing" organisms) have
                                     PREFACE                                   xvii
been affected by what females (the "ovum-producing" ones) do, and vice
versa. But the selflessness of mothc1·s giving of themselves to offspring has
always seemed too vital to the well-being of too many for anyone-scientists
included-to he able to examine their behavior dispassionately. And none
did.Old biases from many sources burrowed in and nestled at the heart of
evolutionary theory, the most coherent and aU-encompassing theory that sci­
entists have ever had to explain the living world.
    It was no accident that first moralists and then Victorian evolutionists
looked to nature to justify assigning to female animals the same qualities that
patriarchal cultures have almost always ascribed to "good" mothers (nurtur­
ing and passh·e).Women were assumed to be "naturally" what patriarchal cul­
tures would socialize them to be: modest, compliant, noncompetitive, and
sexually resen-cd.This, I suspect, is the main reason why sexuality has always
been studied separately from maternity, as if sex has nothing to do with mater­
nity or keeping infants alive.
    Inquiring women have sensed that there were underlying agendas to the
way female nature was depicted, and they responded in different ways. Many
identified a male bias within science-particularly biology. For Virginia
Woolf, the biases were unforgivable.She rejected science outright. "Science,
it would seem, is not sexless; she is a man, a father, and infected too,"Woolf
warned back in 1938. Her diagnosis was accepted and passed on from woman
to woman. It is still taught today in university courses. Such charges reinforce
the alienation many women, especially feminists, feel toward evolutionary
theory and fields like sociobiology.
    Right from the outset of evolutionary thinking, however, a tiny group of
women were as Darwinian as they were feminist. George Eliot, a woman
'Nho took a man's name because women writers at that time were not taken
seriously, was one of them.Eliot, whose real name was Mary Ann Evans,
recognized that her own experiences, frustrations, and desires did not fit
 within the narrow stereotypes scientists then prescribed for her sex. "I
need not crush myself . . . within a mould of theory called Nature!" she
wrote. Eliot's primary interest was always human nature as it could he
revealed through rational study. Thus she was already reading an advance
copy of On the Ori9in ifSpecies on November 24, 1 85"9, the day Darwin's book
 was published.For her, "Science has no sex ...the mere knowing and rea­
soning faculties, if they act correctly, must go through the same process
 and arrive at the same result." I fall in Eliot's camp, aware of the many sources
xviii                             PREFACE
of bias, but nevertheless impressed by the strength of science as a way of
knowing.
    Unlike superstition or religious faith, a good scientist's underlying
assumptions are subject to continuous challenge. Sooner or later in science,
wrong assumptions get revised. Nevertheless, some take longer to get cor­
rected than others, as was the case with overly narrow stereotypes about
females.
    Long ago a wise friend, evolutionary biologist George Williams, warned
me that natural selection is an impersonal "process for the maximization of
short-sighted selfishness," something far worse than moral indifference. Dar­
win was of the same mind: "maternal love or maternal hatred, though the lat­
ter fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable principle of
natural selection." Natural selection is primarily about differential reproduc­
tion, which simply means that some individuals leave more offspring than
others. Once we understand that natural selection has neither morals nor val­
ues, a concept like "Mother Nature" ceases to be shorthand for romanticized
Natural Laws that are more nearly wishful thinking than objective observa­
tion of creatures in the world around us.
    In the course of revising ideas about mothers, I have had to discard much
received wisdom. Compared to what I was taught in graduate school, the
mothers who gradually came into focus for me almost seemed a new life­
form-alien and utterly different from culturally produced expectations.
Mothers were multifaceted creatures, strategists juggling multiple agendas.
As a consequence, their level of commitment to each offspring born was
highly contingent on circumstances. Realizing this, I have been forced to con­
clusions about our ancestresses that, given the values I grew up with and still
live by, I am poorly equipped to comprehend.
    Among the specific questions I address in this book are:
     1. What do we mean by "maternal instincts"? And have women "lost"
        them?
    2.  If women instinctively love their babies, why have so many women
        across cultures and through history directly or indirectly contributed
        to their deaths? Why do so many mothers around the world discrimi­
        nate among their own infants-for example, feeding a son but starving
        a daughter?

    3· Unlike other apes, humans have been selected to produce offspring
       that arc helpless and dependent for so long a time that no woman living
       as our foraging ancestors did could hope to rear a family by herself. Yet
       paternal assistance was then, as now, far from certain. How could there
       have been selection on mothers to produce babies so far beyond their
       m eans to rear?
   4· Gh·cn that fathers share the same proportion of their genes with babies
       as mothers do, w hy didn't fathers evolve to be more attentive to infant
       needs? Arc there (as Charles Darwin also wondered) "latent instincts"
       for nurturing in males? And if o;o, when are they expressed?
    S· So far as babies are concerned, fathers range from caring to indifferent.
       Why then do virtually all men take such an intense interest in the
       reproductive affairs of women?
   6. And, finally, what is the bottom line on infant needs? Just why did these
       little creatures evolve to be so plump, engaging, and utterly adorable?
    History and personal experience of course explain a great deal about how
a mother feels about her baby. But to answer my questions I must travel fur­
ther back in time, long before a court guaranteed a woman's right to privacy
over what goes on in her womb, before contraception , before formal laws of
any kind, before regulations about infanticide, even before cradles or walls­
back to a time when it was essential for someone to be in continuous contact
with a baby just to keep a wild animal from eating it. Many of the emotions
informing women's reproductive decisions today were shaped in this distant
past, by processes that by current standards can only be viewed as inexorable.

          eing a mother has never been simple. Today, modern medicine, safe
          water, stored food, pasteurized milk, cradles, and houses with walls
          make it easier than ever before to keep a baby alive. Rubber-nippled
baby bottles and daycare centers especially designed and licensed for the care
of the very young provide working mothers, even those with weeks-old
babies, with alternatives to the only two viable options previously available:
keep your baby close or find a wet nurse. T he availability of breast pumps and
freezers means that more women can both breast-feed and spend hours sepa­
rated from their babies.
   Above all, there is birth control, which permits a woman to consciously
override her O\'aries and choose when, or if, she will bear children. Ultra­
sound and amniocentesis enable women to spend decades in a career and still
look forward to bearing a healthy infant. Far from simplifying motherhood,
these novel choices have exposed tensions just beneath the cheery surface of
our traditional assumptions about what mothers should be.
   Today, mothers in developed countries, and with them fathers and chil­
dren, enter uncharted terrain. Without anyone raising their hands to volun­
teer, we have become guinea pigs in a vast social experiment that reveals what
women who can control reproduction really want to do. Children, too, are
finding out what it means to be born to a complex and multifaceted creature
who has an unprecedented range of options. It is an experiment-in-progress,
with two outcomes already apparent. First, the decisions that mothers make
do not always conform to our conventional expectations about innately ten­
der, selfless creatures. Second, whatever today's mother decides is likely to be
                                         3

controversial in some quarters. Bluntly put, motherhood has become a mine­
field, and we arc walking through it without so much as a map to guide us.
    Politics of Motherhood
The politician who naively assumes that motherhood, like apple pic, is still a
safe topic quickly learns otherwise. The topic was safe only so long as people
took the centuries-old view of self-sacrificing motherhood for granted. This
view rested on mankind's assumption that women were designed by nature
to be mothers and that they instinctively want to rear every baby they bear.
Self-sacrificing motherhood was what women were for, and women in many
societies have believed this was their destiny. Overlooked was the huge stake
that everyone has in motherhood.
    Our sense of self, pride, vulnerability, propriety, and job security, our life­
long preconceptions and anxieties, our peace of mind, not to mention our
toehold on posterity-all of these depend on what our own mothers, wives,
lovers, daughters, and female colleagues do or are expected by others to do.
This is why a politician can lose votes for encouraging mothers to stay home,
as well as for suggesting they return to work; for pointing out that breastfeed­
ing is beneficial to infants (which it is), as well as for neglecting to mention
that it is. One week, newspaper headlines ask, "Is day care ruining our kids?"'
or decry "A dangerous experiment in child-rearing." Another week, headlines
in the same paper will declare, "Infant bonding is a bogus notion" or call for
businesses to provide more daycarc. 2 At the same time, birth control is still
against the law in many countries; and on the sidewalks outside family plan­
ning clinics in the United States, near civil war prevails. A visitor to Earth
from another planet might well ask how the same creatures that invented
sophisticated technology to explore the solar system could display such
primitive behavior when it comes to the female reproductive system?
    No topic of mother politics is so divisive as abortion, and none elicits
more irrational debate. In Washington, D. C., in May 1 997, a bill was intro­
duced to outlaw a rare type of abortion-the procedure known as dilation
and extraction, christened "partial-birth" by opponents. This is an over­
whelmingly unpopular, traumatic surgical procedure that no group in the
 United States advocates, no woman in the world wants, and no doctor is
eager to perform . Yet this hill marked the fifty-second time that this particu­
lar Congress had debated .an abortion-related issuc.1 Disagreement centered
on whether this distressing procedure could still he pcrfot·med even if physi-
                   l\1 0 T H E R H 0 0 ) ) A S A   M I N E l' I E L D
cians deemed it necessary to save the woman's life, to guard her health, or to
preserve her ability to ha\'e viable children in the future. Those who sought
the across-the-hoard ban were not interested in exploring ways to further
reduce the need for this rarely performed procedure (one tenth of 1 percent
of the   1 •� million abortions performed annually in the United Statest hy
funding more sex education, birth control, and better prenatal care, or by
making it easier to get an abortion early on.Banning late-stage abortion was
simply their first step to banning all abortions.5
    The abortion issue is notorious for generating so much "heat" and so little
"light." On this particular occasion, one of the senators debating the issue
(Rick Santorum, Republican from Pennsylvania) became "so emotional" that
the blood vessels leading to his stomach constricted, while those leading to
his heart and brain dilated. Responding to signals from the most ancient por­
tions of his brain, his pounding heart caused the face of this deeply threatened
mammal to flush "crimson" in preparation for a fight. His voice rose to such a
pitch that colleagues had to intervene.6
    Chances were vanishingly small that any kind of late-stage abortion would
ever he applied to anyone he knew.      Yet against such odds, the senator had just
had a brush with one.He and his wife were informed that the fetus she car­
ried suffered a fatal defect.Even if born alive, the baby, they were told , would
not be viable. Infections ensued, and with his wife's life in jeopardy, physi­
cians asked the senator to consider an abortion. The senator, as he reported
in a press conference afterward, never even came close to accepting that
option. As he saw it, his wife "was in danger of septic shock .. .but she was
not in imminent danger."7
    The abortion debate is ultimately about what it means to be a mother; and
the senator, like many humans before him, had his own unusually clear notion
of what mothers were for.The couple already had three young children, but
this fourth birth was given clear priority over his wife's well-being as well as
that of her other children. Fortunately, the mother survived. But, as doctors
predicted, the new baby died shortly after birth.
    As the debate unfolded, the rush of blood and pounding heart beneath the
senator's coat and tie spoke volumes about motivations far deeper, far older,
than members of Congress ordinarily consider. Like all humans, and indeed
as is typical of the entire Primate order, the senator exhibited an intense, even
obsessive, interest in the reproductive condition of other group members.
Like other high-status male primates before him, he was intent on controlling
6                       LOOK     TO   THE    ANIMALS
when, where, and how females belonging to his group reproduced. One for­
mer member of the House of Representatives, however, sensed that there
was more at stake than just the issues under debate. "It's very interesting the
issues they select," observed Patricia Schroeder of Colorado. "They don't
want to intervene in the bodily functions of men."8
    Schroeder's quip goes to the heart of the matter. Passionate debates about
abortion derive from motivations to control female reproduction that are far
older than any particular sy stem of government , older than patriarchy, older
even than recorded history. Male fascination with the reproductive affairs of
female group members predates our species.
    Young women of my daughters' generation take for granted a historically
unique situation. T hey regard birth control, precautions against sexually
transmitted diseases, women's education and athletic teams, as well as open­
ended professional opportunities for women, as innovations here to stay.
They view the antiabortion movement in the United States, along with the
emergence of powerful political lobbies seeking to substitute "abstinence
only" for practical knowledge about human sexuality and reproduction, as
too irrational to take seriously. Reports from far-off places like Taliban­
controlled Afghanistan, where Islamic fundamentalists seek to deny women
personal autonomy (forcing them to stay sequestered in their homes, keep
their faces and bodies veiled, and marry as instructed) seem exotic and
remote.
    It is hard for my daughters and their generation to believe that such forces
could ever intrude upon their own lives. Even when the sequestering of
women is shown to have measurable costs to the health and well-being of
wives and children (as has recently been documented for Afghanistan) / they
arc saddened, but not apprehensive for themselves. They see no connection
between innate male desires to control women in earlier times and the atti­
tudes toward women and family that inspire sermons to all-male audiences of
"Promise Keepers," or that motivate elected officials to debate endlessly over
who has the right to choose whether and w hen a woman gives birth. Few
Westerners take seriously the possibility that old tensions between maternal
and paternal interests could explode one day in their own country and trans­
form a world they take for granted. I am not nearly so confident. If age-old
pressures are allowed to erode hard-won laws and protections, it is far from
certain that the unique experiment we have embarked upon can persist.

    Mothers of Us All
With six billion people on the planet, it is easy to forget that we have not
always been so numerous. Every person on earth descends from a population
living in Africa roughly Ioo,ooo years ago that probably did not number
more than ten thousand breeding adults. The Pleistocene epoch, between I .6
million and Io, ooo years ago, was also a time when it was very risky to be
born. We are just beginning to understand the full range of hazards and their
implications for the attributes babies possess.
    Almost all women who reached adulthood became pregnant and bore
young. Yet the majority died without a single surviving offspring because so
many of those born never grew up. Consider the life history of a hunter­
gatherer woman named Nisa. This plucky woman belonged to the !Kung San,
a nomadic foraging people who continued to traverse the Kalahari Desert
long into the twentieth century, confronting challenges similar to those faced
by Pleistocene hunters and gatherers for thousands of years before the inven­
tion of agriculture and the domestication of animals for food.
    When interviewed for her biography in the early 197os,Nisa had suffered
two miscarriages and borne three daughters and a son-close to the average
family size (3 ·S children) for a !Kung woman . Two ofNisa's children survived
into adolescence, but both died before adulthood. Thirty-six percent of
!Kung women would, like Nisa, die without a single surviving offspring.10
Since all the !Kung women interviewed were postmenopausal at the time, a
few more might lose their last child before they themselves died . If we take
into account how many women died before they even had a chance to breed,
the true proportion of those dying childless is probably higher. I estimate that
one-half or more of all !Kung women born died childless.
    The death of a child is the most awful occurrence parents can imagine.
Fortunately for most of those reading this book, childhood death is a rarity.
Unlike Nisa, they live in privileged regions of the globe, at least for the time
being, and enjoy an unprecedented standard of living. Nine hundred and
ninety-four of every thousand babies born in the United States survive
infancy. Yet even though the odds of keeping infants alive have improved
astronomically, the chances that a woman in a postindustrial society will die
without descendants have not changed that much. In the Sacramento Valley of
California, where I live, 40 percent of all grown women who died between
 1 890 and 1984 left no surviving offspring. 11 But the reasons so many women
8                         LOOK      TO THE      ANIMALS
in the Kalahari and California populations died childless are quite different.
In twentieth-century California, many of the women never married. Others
could not, or consciously decided not to, have children, or else decided to
give birth to only a few. Almost all infants born survived, so that the average
number of children per woman ( 1 .6) was close to the number actually born.
The circumstances surrounding motherhood have never been more differ­
ent. Yet, as I will show in this book, from contemporary countries in which
women live in a state of ecological release, no longer constrained by having to
forage enough food each day to stay alive and with a broad range of repro­
ductive options, to other parts of the world where they are less fortunate,
women are constantly making tradeoffs between subsistence and reproduc­
tion that are similar in outline.
    Quality vs. Quantity
Depending on the marriage customs in the culture she belongs to, a woman
may or may not get to choose the father of her children or the time in her life
when she first becomes pregnant. Depending on prevailing values, she may or
may not treat her sons and daughters, her firstborn versus her last-born,
exactly the same way. Yet, by and large, she will decide how much of herself,
her time, energy, and love, she will invest in each child. The father has similar
choices, although he may make quite different decisions. In the past, such
decisions had a direct effect on both a mother's own survival and that of her
children. Throughout most of human existence, to be an infant without a
mother, or a child without older kin, was to suffer a life-threatening disad­
vantage. To have become the ancestress of any one of us today, a mother
would have had to succeed in rearing at least one offspring to breeding age. In
turn, that offspring would have had to produce surviving heirs. This is why
quantity has rarely been the top priority for a mother. The well-being of her
children and their quality of life, usually inseparable from her own, were pri­
mary. When fidelity to his mate means that a man's reproductive success is
identical to his only wife's, he is more likely to share her preference for qual­
ity over quantity. Otherwise, and especially if he does not intend to invest in
his offspring, a man may simply seck to breed with as many women, and
hence sire as many offspring, as he can. It is from such ancestors that we
inherit our maternal emotions and decision-making equipment. Underly ing
tensions between males striving for quantity and females for quality (a sim­
plification I will clarify later) arc as old as humanity. Yet this tension has risen
                  MOTHERHOOD            AS   A  MINEFIELD                      9
to the sm·face and become mm·c conspicuous than ever in the ecological cir­
cumstances of     a modern world in which women have unprecedented
choices.
    For example, when y oung women arc given a choice between having chil­
dren and improving their lot in life, most opt for the latter. At first glance,
such a finding seems completely antithetical to predictions from evolutionary
theory. In the crass·coinagc of my Darwinian worldvicw, success is measured
in terms of"fitness," genetic representation in succeeding generations. Access
to more resources should translate into people having more children, not
fewer. Certainly there is massive documentation that throughout recorded
history, quite a few men opted for more.
    Kings, emperors, and despots-who had the power to do so-filled their
seraglios with fertile women. Feudal lords insisted on droit de seigneur
with virgins marrying within their domains, while some American presidents
haYe used their office (literally, the oval one) to enjoy assignations.12 How­
e,·cr, the emphasis on quantity that holds true for male potentates (and surely
we don't call them that for nothing) docs not hold true for mothers.
    Around the world, there is a tendency for people who are better off to
haYc a lower birthrate. This tendency is evident among peasant women in
India as well as women in industrialized societies. Witness the declining
birthrates in contemporary Japan, or the below-replacement fertility that has
long characterized modern France and Italy and is increasingly true in estab­
lished populations in the United States. Wherever women have both control
oYer their reproductive opportunities and a chance to better themselves,
women opt for well-being and economic security over having more chil­
dren.13 For many, leaving children every day while they work is a matter of
sun-ivai, the only way mothers can support their families, or the only way
they can secure a decent future for offspring. (A big difference between mod­
ern industrial societies and people who live by foraging is that children who
must not only be fed but clothed and educated become more costly with age,
not less.)
    But survival does not explain all the choices. Third world peasants just
making a skimpy living on small plots of land will trade the clean air and safer
environment of the countryside for squalid urban shantytowns with their
glimmer of economic opportunity, accepting the deaths of some children
from respiratory or gastrointestinal infections in exchange for some pros­
pect of a "better" life. Far more privileged women also may opt for self-
 10                      LOOK      TO  THE     ANIMALS
realization over reproduction, forgoing motherhood to become artists,
pilots, or scientists.
    At first their choices appear counter to evolutionary expectations, until
we recall that mothers evolved not to produce as many children as they could
but to trade off quantity for quality, or to achieve a secure status, and in that
way increase the chance that at least a few offspring will survive and prosper.
This is why a closer look at what late-twentieth-century women are doing
reveals behavior that is not so much "unnatural" as behavior that is in conflict
with conventional expectations-all the myths and superstitions about what
women are supposed to want.
    So how did people in the Western world come to conceptualize female
nature and "motherhood" the way we do?
    Maternity and Charity
Biologically the word maternity refers to conceiving and giving birth, just as
paternity refers to the individual who sires an offspring.But in the West, the
concept of maternity carries with it a long tradition of self-sacrifice. "Her
charity was the cause of her maternitie . .." reads the Oiford Enolish Dictio­
nary's illustrative sentence for a word in use from at least the seventeenth
century. How confidently, then, could eighteenth-century moralists, steeped
in the Enlightenment's celebration of God, Reason, Nature, and Man,
admonish women (in a famous passage from 1 770) to "Look to the animals
for your example. . .."
    Even though (animal] mothers have their stomachs torn open ....
    Even though their offspring have been the cause of all their woes, their
    first care makes them forget all they have suffered....They forget
    themselves, little concerned with their own happiness .. ..Woman
    like all animals is under the sway of this instinct.14
    No matter what their physical condition, the author-French physician
Jean-Emmanuel Gilihert-was convinced that women should follow nature's
eternal and unchanging precepts by nursing each child they bore.He was not
trying to frighten his patients, only remind them of their instinctive and God­
given maternal duty to nurture offspring.Gilihcrt and others like him looked
to the animals not to make unbiased empirical observations but to usc nature
to confirm their own and their society's preconceptions about how humans

should behave. T hese men, who were more evangelists than sci entists, im­
posed their moral code on nature rather than allowing creatures in the nat­
ural world to speak for themselves.
     Gilibert's passionate insistence on suckling derived from his antipathy to
the then-widespread practice of wet-nursing, hiring a lactating, often much
poorer, woman to breast-feed a mother's baby for her. A vast number of
babies during this period were sent away right after birth to a distant rural
wet nurse, consigning them to severe hardships and indifferent care. As a
result, infant mortality soared. Gilibert was convinced that this "vice" of wet­
nursing was responsible for France's declining population (a fascinating dis­
tortion of the real situation, about which more later).
    In urban areas such as Paris the majority of infants born (9 5 percent,
according to a 178o police report (discussed in chapter 141) were sent away
to wet nurses. Yet Gilibert knew that humans arc mammals, and that women,
like all female mammals, have breasts in order to suckle their youna. To Gilibert,
 [ 2                       LOOK   TO   THE    ANIMALS
this could only mean that women were intended by God to nurture their
young; to shun this duty was unnatural.
     Gilibert's grasp of our place in nature derived from the new classification
by the great Swedish taxonomist Carolus Linnaeus. Among other things,
Linnaeus's Systema Naturae of r 735 called attention to the special relationship
that links humans to prosimians, monkeys, and apes. They were all lumped
together in one order, Primates-Latin for "first ranking."
     Underlying Agendas
Something just as primal, however, also linked Gilibert and Linnaeus. The
two medical men were united in their assessment of what females were for
and in their opposition to wet-nursing. Gilibert had translated one of Lin­
naeus's anti-wet-nursing pamphlets from Latin (the language of science at the
time) into French so that it might reach a wider audience. The title Nutrix
Noverca can be crudely translated as the cruel or unnatural "step-nurse."
     It was to highlight the importance of lactation that Linnaeus identified an
entire class of animals-Mammalia-by the odd milk-secreting glands that
develop in only half the members of the class. The Latin term mammae derives
from the plaintive cry "mama" spontaneously uttered by young children in
widely divergent linguistic groups. The urgent message, "Suckle me," is uni­
versal. By calling mammals Mammals, instead of "sucklers" (as in the Ger­
man term for mammals, Sauaetiere), Linnaeus was making his point about
both a natural law and the unnaturalness of any woman who deviated from it
                        15

     Our views of"motherhood" (including such scientific-sounding phrases as
"the maternal instinct") derive from these old ideas and even older tensions
between males and females. The fact that most of us equate maternity with
charity and self-sacrifice, rather than with the innumerable things a mother
does to make sure some of her offspring grow up alive and well, tells us a
great deal about how conflicting interests between fathers and mothers were
played out in our recent history. Sad to say, these old conceptions about
maternity infiltrated modern evolutionary thinking.
     Darwinism, Social Darwinism, and the
     "Supreme Function" of Mothers
According to Genesis, God created first heaven, then earth , then each variety
of plant, every species of nonhuman animal, and, on the sixth day, man, and
                   MOTHERHOOD          AS    A MINEFIELD
from one of his ribs, or perhaps his thigh, woman. In 18�9, Charles Darwin
proposed a remlutionary alternative to the biblical account. He titled his
alternath·e genesis On the Ori9in cfSpecies.
     Darwin proposed that humans, along with every other kind of animal,
evoh·ed through a gradual, mindless, and unintentional process dubbed nat­
ural selection. Morally indifferent, natural selection culls and biases life
chances with the unintended result that evolution (defined today as the
change in gene frequencies over time) takes place. This mindless and "worse
than morally indifferent" process geared to the maximization of short-sighted
selfishness is what we mean by natural selection. She is the old lady with bad
habits, the "Mother Nature" of my title.
     Every em·ironment, said Darwin, confronts organisms with challenges
to their survival, whether the problem is cold or heat, tropical damp or
drought, famine, predators, or limited space. For mothers, these problems
become obstacles to keeping their infants alive. Individuals that are best
adapted to their current environment survive and reproduce, passing on the
attributes they possess to future generations. Losers in the struggle to survive
die before they have a chance to breed, or they produce few offspring. Even­
tually, their line dies out.
    The unfortunate and much misused expression "survival of the fittest" to
paraphrase this phenomenon was introduced not by Darwin but by his pro­
lific and widely read contemporary, the social philosopher Herbert Spencer.
To Spencer, survival of the fittest meant "survival of the best and most
        .
deservmg.
            "
     Indeed, Spencer's popularity was due to the simple take-home message
delivered to his privileged audience in Victorian England and America: the
advantages y ou enjoy are well deserved. For him, evolution meant proaress.
The flaw in Spencer's reasoning was to mistakenly assume that environments
stay the same, unchanging backgrounds against which "superior," optimally
adapted individuals rise to the top and stay there in perpetuity. What Spencer
left out were the fluctuating contingencies of an ever-changing world.
     Only colored by that oversight could Spencer's social Darwinism provide a
blanket endorsement of the status quo. By contrast, Darwinism-real Dar­
winian thought, correctly interpreted-ascribes no special place to any one.
No adaptation continues to be selected for outside the circumstances that
happen to favor it.
     When Darwin adopted Spencer's phrase "survival of the fittest," he meant
                         LOOK     TO  THE     ANIMALS
the survival of those best suited to their current circumstances, not the sur­
vival of the best in any absolute sense . To Darwin, fitness meant the ability to
reproduce offspring that would, themse1ves, mate and reproduce. But no
matter. Spencer and his foHowers were gratified that so celebrated a natural­
ist and experimentalist as Darwin would cite his views, accept his catchy
phrase, and endorse heartfelt convictions about essential differences between
males and females that derived from Spencer's theory of a physiological divi­
sion of 1abor by sex.
    The supreme function of women, Spencer believed, was childbearing, and
toward that great eugenic end women should be beautiful so as to keep the
species physical1y up to snuff. Because mammalian females are the ones that
ovulate, gestate, bear young, and lactate (this much is irrefutable), Spencer
assumed that the diversion of so much energy into reproduction had
inevitably to lead to "an earlier arrest of individual evolution in women than

different, but Spencer's females were mired in maternity.
    For Spencer, this physiological division of labor by sex meant that men
produce, women merely reproduce. Costs of reproduction constrained men­
tal development in women and imposed narrow bounds on how much any
one female could vary from another in terms of intellect. Since variation
between individuals is essential for natural selection to take place (which is
true), Spencer reasoned (wrongly) that there was too little variation among
females for proper selection to occur, precluding the evolution in women of
higher "intellectual and emotional" faculties, which are the "latest products of
human evolution."
    Spencer was aware that a woman might occasionally possess a capacity for
abstract reasoning. The only such female he personally knew, however, was
Mary Ann Evans (the novelist George Eliot), whom he regarded as "the most
admirable woman, mentally, I ever met." But Spencer regarded her gifts as a
freak of nature, attributable to that trace of "masculinity" that characterized
her powerful intellect.17
    The assumption that education would be wasted on women was, of
course, a self-fulfilling prophecy. Denied higher education and opportunities
to enter fields like science, how could women not fail to excel in them? Eliot
herself was one of a minuscule number of women in Europe at that time edu­
cated (in her case, largely self-educated) in languages, literature, philosophy,

and natural science. By regarding her as a masculinized exception, Spencer
could reconcile his recognition of this woman's talents with his internalized
evolutionary scale, on which women hovered in a fecund, biologically pre­
destined limbo somewhere between Victorian gentlemen, on the one hand,

and children and savages, on the other.
    Women as Breeding Machines
Spencer's validation of the status quo had far broader popular and political
appeal than Darwin's more nihilistic perspective ever could. This is one rea­
son why social Darwinism would become so influential. The second, related,
reason was that Spencer's theory of the phy siological division of labor by sex
provided a scientific-sounding rationale for assuming male intellectual and
social superiority. Spencer's "scientific" theories were an urgently needed
antidote to the rising tide of feminist sentiment-especially in the United
States-at a time when women were making real headway in their efforts to
obtain the rights to vote and to own property in their own name.
    Even before Freud declared that sex is destiny, Spencer and other evolu­
tionists were constructing a complex theoretical edifice based on that as­
sumption. They took for granted that being female forestalled women from
evolving"the power of abstract reasoning and that most abstract of emotions,
the sentiment of justice." Predestined to be mothers, women were born to be

passive and noncompetitive, intuitive rather than logical. Misinterpretations
of the cYidcnce regarding women's intelligence were cleared up early in the
twentieth century. More basic difficulties having to do with this overly nar­
row definition of female nature were incorporated into Darwinism proper
                                 0
and linger to the present day. 2
    Equating a complex organism with a single defining "essence," such as giv­
ing birth, is known as essentialism. In 1949, the French writer Simone de
Beauvoir sarcastically articulated the essentialist view in The Second Sex:
"\Voman? Very simple, say the fanciers of simple formulas: she is a womb, an
ovary; she is a female-this word is sufficient to define her."
    Earlier generations of feminists had also responded to Spencer and Dar­
win. For the most part, however, their voices went unheard. Eliot was one of
the few exceptions, although she is far better remembered for her novels than
for her critiques of early evolutionary thought. Yet even in her fiction Eliot
took e,·ery opportunity to slip in rejoinders to Spencer's essentialist views
and to demonstrate how multifaceted female nature actually is.
    In her first major novel, Adam Bede (read by Darwin as he relaxed after the
exertions of preparing the Ori9in for publication), Eliot put Spencer's views
concerning the diversion of somatic energy into reproduction in the mouth
of a pedantic and blatantly misogynist old schoolmaster, Mr. Bartle: "That's
the way with these women-they've got no head-pieces to nourish, and so
                                                        1
their food all runs either to fat or to brats . . . ."2
    No doubt there was an edge to Eliot's rebuttals of Spencer. She had once
dreamed of sharing her life with him. Opinionated as he was, Spencer was
one of the few people in her circle seeking a rational alternative to religious
dogma . It was Spencer who introduced her to evolutionary thinking, and he
shared her passionate commitment to a scientifically based understanding of
human nature.
    They met in London in 185"1 and soon after, she confessed her love and
sent him an extraordinarily direct proposal which still survives. 22 Whatever
his real reasons, Spencer's stated reasons for turning her down were eugenic.
Eliot lacked, he said, the physical beauty he considered essential for mothers.
As he put it: "Nature's . . . supreme end, is the welfare of posterity, and as far
as posterity is concerned, a cultivated intelligence based upon a bad physique
is of little worth, seeing that its descendants will die out in a generation or
two."23 Eliot, whose nose was long, her jaw pronounced, was too masculine-

    "The One Animal in All Creation
    About Which Man Knows the Least"
Spencer was not the only early evolutionist to wear blinders where women
were concerned. Guided by a theory of unusual scope and power, Charles
Darwin exhibited an uncanny knack for winnowing out kernels of accurate
observation from the hodgepodge of anecdotes being sent him by a vast array
of hobbyists, pigeon breeders, and sea captains from around the world. Yet he
could not shake the biases of a man who had, after all, grown up in a patriar­
chal world where the most important thing a woman ever did was choose, or
be chosen by, a man of means. It did not occur to his Victorian imagination­
as it would immediately have occurred to a ! Kung forager-just how re­
sourceful and strategic a woman would have to he to keep children alive and
survive herself.
    Compared with his observations on barnacles, orchids, coral reefs, and
even the expression of emotion in his own children, Darwin's observation of
women and other female primates, in particular, were at best cursory. Thus in
a passage few evolutionary biologists like to recall, and few feminists can
hring themselves to forget, did the ever-careful Darwin deliver himself of

the opinion that: "whether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination,
or merely the use of the senses and hands, (man will attain) a higher emi­
nence ... than can woman."26 Like Spencer, Darwin convinced himself that
because females were especially equipped to nurture, males excelled at
everything else. No wonder women turned away from biology.
 20                      LOOK    TO    THE    ANIMALS
    For a handful of nineteenth-century women intellectuals, however, evolu­
tionary theory was just too important to ignore . Instead of turning away, they
stepped forward to tap Darwin and Spencer on the shoulder to express their
support for this revolutionary view of human nature, and also to politely
remind them that they had left out half the species .
    In 187s, four years after Darwin's The Descent ifMan and Selection in Rela­
tion to Sex appeared, there came a polite, almost diffident, rejoinder from the
American feminist Antoinette Brown Blackwell. "When, therefore, Mr.
Spencer argues that women are inferior to men because their development
must be earlier arrested by reproduction," she wrote in The Sexes Throuahout
Nature, "and Mr. Darwin claims that males have evolved muscle and brains
much superior to females, and entailed their pre-eminent qualities chiefly on
their male descendants, these conclusions need not be accepted without
question, even by their own school of evolutionists ."27
    Unquestionably, the most brilliantly subversive of these nineteenth­
century distaff Darwinians was Clt�mence Royer, Darwin's petite, blue-eyed
French translator. Self-educated like Eliot, Royer was the first woman in
France to be elected to a scientific society. Darwin initially admired her as the
"oddest and cleverest woman in France" but by the third edition of the Ori9in
had lost patience with what he regarded as Royer's presumptuous manner. It
particularly irritated Darwin that she criticized his (erroneous) ideas about
"pangenesis," Darwin's notion of how maternal and paternal attributes were
blended in their offspring. Darwin instructed his publishers to find another
translator (a man, who did not do nearly so good a job), essentially firing her.
Ultimately, what most unncned Royer's fellow evolutionists would have
been her outspoken views on the "weakening of maternal instinct" in the
human species and tactics women use to subvert patriarchal control of their
lives .28
    In France at this time the decline in birthrate, or"demographic transition,"
that occurred in industrialized countries from the nineteenth century
onward was well under way. Frenchmen were both puzzled and deeply con­
cerned. There were plenty of married women of breeding age, many with
more than sufficient resources for a family, some even wealthy, yet the cen­
suses continued to register a declining population. Plenty of food, yet little in
the way of"brats."
    Not in the least puzzled, Royer scoffed at her male colleagues' lack of
imagination:"Woman . . . is the one animal in all creation about which man
                      1\1 0 T H F R II 0 0 I> A S   A  1\l I N E I' I E I. I>     2I
knows the least. ... a !(>reign species." W hen a male scientist describes
women, she cautioned, he either extrapolates from his own experience or,
worse, engages in an exercise in wishful thinking. Women were simply dis­
guising from men their conscious desire to haYe few children. Large numbers
of wonH.'n, she bdie,·cd, were deliberately curtailing conception -an idea
that did not at all fit cuiTent evolutionary    .I

      \Vithin the French scientific establishment of that time, Royer was doubly
suhYersin•-Darwinian in Lamarck's homeland and a maverick female with
iconoclastic ideas about motherhood. No other evolutionist in the world,
much less a woman, was writing about women who learn to he "mistresses so
they do not ha\'c to he mothers," or wrote so enthusiastically about new tech­
niques emanating from America for aborting unwanted pregnancies, taking
adnntage of physicians who have learned to "skillfully kill off the fruit with-
out InJUrmg
        . . .    the tree."'9-
      Royer's own book on the origin of man (Ori9ine de l'homme et des societes)
appeared in 1 87o. But her most interesting ideas were set down in a later
manuscript explaining why maternal instincts were weakened in the human
species. Entitled "Sm· Ia natalitc-'' (On birth), it was already in proof for an
 1 8 75'  edition of the bulletin of the Societe d' Anthropologie de Paris when the
journal's editors suppressed its publication. In that suppressed manuscript
Rover wrote:
     .I
      Up until now, science, like law, has been exclusively made by men and
      has considered woman too often an absolutely passive being, without
      instincts, passions, or her own interests; a purely plastic material that
      without resistance can take whatever form one wishes to give it; a liv­
      ing creature without personal conscience, without will, without inner
      resources to react against her instincts, her hereditary passions, or
      finally against the education that she receives and against the discipline
      to which she submits following law, customs, and public opinion.

did eventually respond to these criticisms, yet in their lifetimes, the effect
that these early Darwinian feminists-Eliot, Blackwell, Royer, and a few
others-had on mainstream evolutionary theory can be summed up with one
phrase: the road not taken. The toll was a costly one .
     More than a century would elapse before Darwinians began to incorpo­
rate the full range of selection pressures on females into evolutionary analy­
ses and in doing so recognize the extent to which males and females had
coevolved, each sex responding to stratagems and attributes of the other. It
took far longer than it should have to correct old biases, for evolutionists to
recognize just how much one mother could vary from another, and to take
note of the importance of maternal effects and context-specific develop­
ment.

    An unfortunate by-product of the delay in correcting long-standing biases
in cYolutionary theory was that by the last quarter of the twentieth century,
when emlutionary paradigms ·were widened to include both sexes , many
women, especially feminists, had already long since abandoned evolutionary
approaches as hopelessly biased. Biology itself came to he viewed by women
as a field sown with mines, best avoided altogether. 32
    The "Invisible Violence of the Institution of Motherhood"
Today Spencer's ideas arc generally out of favor. Yet the "naturalistic fallacy"
(mistaking what sometimes is for what should be) never really disappeared. 33
Spencerian ideas about universal and enduring species-typical standards of
physical perfection arc alive and well. A 1996 Newsweek cover story on the
"Biology of Beauty" sported a photo of a perfectly beautiful Barbie-faced Cau­
casian woman with the caption, "Would you want your children to carry this
person's gcnes?"14W ithin, a partially clad male model with a measuring tape
compares the statistics of his female counterpart against a species-specific
ideal, while scientists pronounce that "beauty is a signal of fertility and
genetic quality" which, as far as I know, is a proposition never tested among
humans. 3' Spencer's ideas on the importance of not just youth and good
health but "personal beauty" persist. The notion that there is some unchang­
ing status quo is still a given in some circles, almost always with Spencer's ini­
tial patriarchal assumptions intact. This status quo is a world where men
control the resources women need to breed so that women everywhere­
just as in the Victorian England George Eliot described in her novels­
choose mates on the basis of wealth, while men choose breeding mates
according to how nearly they approximate species-typical standards of
beauty, or as Eliot put it: "wives must be what men will choose: men's taste is
woman's test"; thus Lord Grandcourt, the Eliot character who most epito­
mizes patriarchal control of females, "would not have liked a wife . .. whose
nails were not of the right shape; nor one the lobe of whose car was at all too
large . . . ." The consequences of such a breeding system where women
choose men for inherited resources they did not earn, and men choose
women for looks alone (as Darwin but not Spencer recognized) is not only
destructive to women but terrible for the viability of offspring. (Lord Grand­
court's beautiful wife nc\'Cr conceives, and he dies young, without legitimate
issue. ) 36
    Evolutionary psychologists studying mate preferences today throw the

occasional sop to women lest they mind being told they should look like Bar­
bie dolls or else despair of becoming successful breeders. David Buss's recent
book, The Evolution if Desire, assured young women that:
    All women today are unique, distinctive winners of a five million year
    Pleistocene beauty contest of sexual selection. Every female ancestor
    of the readers of these words was attractive enough to obtain enough
    male investment to raise at least one child to reproductive age. . . . 37
Yet, as I will make clear, any Pleistocene woman who relied on looks alone to
pull offspring through was not likely to be a mother ver y long or leave
descendants.
But it wasn't just social Darwinist stereotypes about what females should be,
or instinctively do, or what they are innately incapable of doing, that both­
ered feminists. Ideas about what irifants instinctively needed mothers to do gener­
ated even more alarm. W ith her usual magisterial sweep, Simone de Beauvoir
summed up such fears. Biological stereotypes will lead to the "enslavement of
the female to the species and the limitations of her various powers."38
    Attachment theory-the proposal that human infants have an innate need
for a primary attachment figure in the first years of life, a role that mothers
are uniquely qualified to fill, and that human babies deprived of such attach­
ments suffer irreparable damage-rubbed precisely the spot where evolu­
tionary acid burns deepest into feminist sensibilities. Women seemed to be
offered the choice of putting their lives on hold for years or else becoming
irresponsible mothers. The way many feminists saw it, an infant "attached"
meant a mother enchained.
    One obvious way for these feminists to avoid this painful and irreconcil­
able dilemma was to deny that biology is relevant to human affairs or even
deny that infants have innate needs for highly personalized care. Another tac­
tic was to insist that the human brain and our capacity for culture make us so
different from other animals that humans can learn to be anything they
choose. In fact, humans can learn a lot, but not anything we choose, and espe­
cially not in such ancient emotional domains as those involved with "love."
                  1\IOTHERHOOD           AS  A  MINEFIELD                     2�
Nevertheless, the idea took hold that maternal love was a socially con­
structed sentiment without any biological basis, a "gift given."39
About the same time John Bowlby was pioneering an evolutionary perspec­
tive on infant development, a darker literature was emerging. The diagnosis
of"battered child syndrome" first appeared in the 196os.4° From the 198os
onward, however, there was increasing awareness that infant abuse, neglect ,
abandonment, and infanticide were far more widespread than even those of
us who studied such phenomena had realized. I already knew that abandon­
ment and infanticide--both in humans and other animals-stretched far
back in evolutionary time. I just had not realized the magnitude of what was
going on. E,·en after I grasped the larger picture, I had trouble admitting to
myself what the numbers gleaned from so many independent sources were
showing, or what they meant.
    Infanticide is not an appealing topic, especially not to women. Neverthe­
less, many feminists saw in some of these grim statistics a sort of intellectual
sih-er lining. Historical, ethnographic, and demographic case studies docu­
mented the existence of many mothers who did not instinctively care for
their young. Surely the prevalence of so many non-nurturing mothers under­
mined "essentialist" arguments about mothers genetically preprogrammed to
nurture babies.
    If women do not naturally nurture their young, then the parent with XX
chromosomes is no more innately equipped for child-rearing than fathers
are, ran their argument . Hence, why should the breadwinning mom be
expected to stay home from work to tend a sick child, but not the dad? If
mothers are no better equipped to be parents than fathers are, mothers need
no longer shoulder so much blame when things go amiss. Gone, then, would
be the dreaded "judgements and condemnations, the fear of her own power,
the guilt, the guilt, the guilt," as Adrienne Rich so graphically identified the
real "G-spot" for mothers.41 And as for babies? One all-too-current feminist
response is that we will worry about that another day, when data are "more
conclusive."
    W hatever moral one derives, clearly one of the West's most cherished
ideals and, even in scientific circles, widely accepted pieces of conventional
 26                     LOOK     TO THE       ANIMALS
wisdom-the view that mothers instinctively nurture their offspring-has
been receiving bad press of late. A rash of poetry and psychoanalytic com­
mentary has also emerged, registering discontent with what Adrienne Rich
calls "the invisible violence of the institution of motherhood." What Rich is
referring to was the impossible ideal by which mothers not just willingly but
"naturally" punch in for twenty-four-hour lifelong shifts of unconditional
love.
    Now that the generally accepted view that mothers instinctively love their
offspring has been toppled, and now that it can be demonstrated (on many
fronts) that maternal succor in the human species is anything but automatic
or universal, how can we maintain that there is a biological basis to a mother's
attachment to her infant? The answer all depends on what we actually mean
by "biological basis."
    Much lip service has been paid to "Biology,""Instinct," and "Natural Laws"
without a great deal of attention paid to how maternal behavior unfolds in the
real, everyday environments in which mothers actually live, or in those very
different ancient environments in which women evolved . My focus in this
bo�k is both this recent historical past and especially the distant past where
natural selection worked to shape the human life-forms that mothers and
infants have become today. I am interested in whatever windows we have for
peering into and reconstructing these worlds. They help me with my quest to
more fully understand maternal emotions, infants' needs, and the implica­
tions of natural selection for mothers and infants alike. Understanding how
creatures like us originated-creatures that are at once mammalian , primate,
hominoid (or apelike), and human-helps us to understand the deep as well
as recent history of the compromises that being a mother, or a father,
inevitably entails. Without such a perspective, we cannot hope to do anything
more than sweep the surface of terrain where landmines are buried deep
below. Even when it isn't possible to completely defuse a mine-for these
dilemmas are tough, sometimes truly irreconcilable-there are advantages
to at least knowing where one is buried.

                essentialist views still prevailed.Mothers were viewed as one­

where practitioners were unlikely to be exposed to critiques Like Eliot's, who
in I 85 5 expressly warned about "the folly of absolute definitions of woman's
nature."1
    According to a widely cited I 96 3 essay on "The Female Primate" by one of
the first women professors of biological anthropology, which was published
in an anthology ironically titled The Potential if Woman:
    Her primary focus, a role which occupies more than 70 percent of her
    life, is motherhood ....A female raises one infant after another for
    her entire adult life.... Dominance interaction is usually minimal in
    the life of a female. She is invariably subordinate to all the adult males
    in the group and seldom if ever contests [their] superior status.2
In other words this female potential consisted of her capacity to conceive,
gestate, and suckle babies, period.
    No creature epitomized "the female primate" better than old Flo, Jane
Goodall's wonderfully appealing, droopy -lipped chimpanzee mother who
"starred" in a half-dozen National Geographic specials.Flo seemed the model

of maternal patience and devotion, evoking the "Magic Mama" in Marge
Piercy's poem of that name, the Mama:
    who sweats honey, an aphid

Many behavioral biologists assumed that "the normal [female] always is a
mother" and that those "females which had the most difficulty in becoming
pregnant are generally those who have very severe antisocial and social prob­
lems.'74 Any reluctance or failure to care for offspring, any diversion of her
energy to other pursuits, especially a mother's demonstration of competitive
intent or aggressive behavior on her part, was viewed as pathological. 5
    Mothers Out of Context
Through the 1 96os, comparative psychologists isolated mother rats, ham­
sters, cats, and other animals in discrete cages with only their offspring for
company. Subjects were buffered from the complexities of larger social net­
works and the need or opportunity to forage (what one might call "breadwin­
ning"). These mother-infant units were eerily reminiscent of model suburban
housewives of the same era. Inevitably, separation of the mother and her
young from other individuals limited the range of behaviors obser ved, while
the research protocols virtually preordained which behaviors could be
reported.
    Mother-infant pairs were kept separate from their ecological or social and
"political" surroundings. 6 Because food was freely available, little attention
was paid to how mothers might differ in foraging abilities or resource
defense. Behaviors other than nurturing, such as striving for status, seeking
out or avoiding particular males, relations with kin and other group mem­
bers, were viewed as irrelevant to a female's role as a mother.The virtual
realities called "check-sheets" that these early researchers drew up to
describe "maternal behavior" recorded how often a mother approached, hov­
ered over, licked, carried, or suckled her infant. Categories describing inter­
actions with other animals were rarely inclu<led. In any event, there \Verc
usually no animals except babies in the cage with her; hence no attention was
                       A NEW     VIEW     OF    MOTHERS
paid to the possible significance of other group members who might assist­
or interfere-with infant-rearing.
    "Maternal behavior" as defined in this narrow way was a convenient opera­
tional category to aid in quantitative descriptions of what mothers do to care
for their int:·mts. Unfortunately, narrow definitions became synonymous with
mothers themselves . It was all too easy to continue to "look to the animals"
not to describe how females in nature actually behave hut to confirm precon­
ceptions about what it means to he a mother mammal. But new ways of
ohsening animals in their natural habitats, and new ways of thinking about
the role individuals play in the evolutionary process, would provide field­
workers their first hint that motherhood was going to turn out to be more
complicated than could be deduced from such limited studies.
    Instead of interchangeable members belonging to a homogeneous class
called "mothers," this new life-form would include a wide range of highly
variable individuals who dealt with a wide array of situations and challenges.
"Real-life" mothers were just as much strategic planners and decision­
makers, opportunists and deal-makers, manipulators and allies as they were
nurturers. The compromises mothers made and the tactics they employed
were everywhere contingent on circumstances rather than being automatic,
and might or might not result in nurturing behavior. These were the trends
that would eventually transform the way we thought about female primates
such as old Flo.
    The key to this paradigm shift began almost imperceptibly with the real­
ization by a handful of field biologists that even though Darwinians talk about
the origin of species, Darwinian natural selection rarely if ever acts at the level
of the species. Mothers did not evolve to benefit the species but to translate
such reproductive effort as they could muster into progeny who would them­
selves survive and reproduce. W hat evolves is not behaviors that benefit
groups but behaviors that contribute to the differential reproductive success
of individuals-even at a cost to others in the group.
    From Group to Individual Selection
David Lack, arguably the first "reproductive ecologist," was among the first
evolutionists to analyze the breeding behavior of mothers as individuals. Sci­
entific advisor to the British Trust for Ornithology in the years before World
War II, Lack mobilized amateur bird-watchers all over England to collect

data on individually banded swallows, robins, and other birds, an endeavor
still going on today. Nests were watched, eggs counted and weighed. Lack
paid special attention to how many eggs actually hatched. Of those hatched,
how many chicks fledged?
     Unprecedented quantities of data on the breeding success of individually
known mothers living under a broad range of naturally occurring conditions
poured in. With characteristic understatement, Lack noted that "individual
differences exist and arc by no means ncgligiblc."7
    Lack saw no evidence that mothers adjusted fertility so as to benefit their
group or species.                  Rather, mothers-with greater or lesser success­
managed their reproductive effort so as to make the best of their own partic­
ular circumstances. The hird who laid the most eggs in a given season, or who
attempted to rear every egg she produced, did not necessarily fledge the most
chicks. Over her entire lifespan, the female who bred all-out did not neces­
sarily rear the most surviving offspring. Lack's tindings marked the beginning
                      A  NEW     VlE\V     01'  MOTHERS
of thinking about reproduction in terms of tradeoiTs. New models for under­
standing maternal behaviot· assumed that mothers traded off reproduction in
the present against the possibility of doing better in the future, and then
tested these assumptions against data from the real world.
    The Fundamental Tradeoff in the Life of Mothers
Lack was particularly struck by the way mother birds staggered egg-laying.
Among gulls, eagles, herons, boobies, and other birds, mothers lay eggs a day
or so apart. Instead of waiting until her clutch is complete, a mother begins
to incubate the eggs right away, with the result that the first-laid egg hatches
several day s before the last one. From that point on, the die is cast, the stage is
set. The first chick laid will he the first to hatch, larger and more mature. It
·will already ha,·e received food from the parents by the time later chicks
hatch. The older sib then easily intimidates younger siblings to a point of"no
contest." Should food become scarce, the weaker soon succumbs to starva­
tion.
    By optimistically aiming high, then allowing the strongest in her brood to
pare it down as needed, mother birds brought brood size in line with food
supply by both what they did (lay eggs at intervals but begin brooding right
away) and what they did not do (intervene or compensate). It was a flexible
system, well suited to fluctuating food supplies. If food was scarce, the brood
would be reduced prior to the point of maximum demands on the mother to
bring in food for growing chicks. If food was abundant, however, the entire
brood survived-including the eggs hatched"on spec."8
    The cruel efficiency of brood manipulation implied considerably more
discretion on the part of females than Herbert Spencer had imagined. Fur­
thermore, females were far from interchangeable. Female reproductive suc­
cess varied enormously over the course of their lives, and even within single
seasons. Such variation meant that females were a sex wide open to selection.
And this meant something else. Although a mother's interests would often be
identical with those of her brood, this would not always be the case. The same
mother who bravely drove away a predator from her nest would not inter­
vene to protect the last-hatched chick from a less ferocious but more lethal
enemy, its own older sib. This was a highly discriminating mother, whose
commitment to her young was contingent on circumstances.
    Could natural selection actually favor such mothers? It was several
decades before a young ornithologist named Caldwell Hahn decided to test
 32                      LOOK     TO    THE ANIMALS
Lack's hypothesis. Like a post-Enlightenment deus ex machina, she swooped
down upon a colony of laughing gulls in a New Jersey salt marsh and
switched eggs around so as to rewrite past evolution by producing experi­
mental nests filled with eggs laid on the same day, which would therefore
hatch at the same time. Mother gulls with artificially equalized broods were
twice as likely to lose their entire reproductive effort as were "control" moth­
ers, whose eggs were also manipulated but rearranged so as to hatch asyn­
chronously-as they would have if left alone. (Eggs had to be moved around
in both experimental and control groups so that experimenters could be sure
that human intervention by itself did not produce greater mortality.)
    David Lack had identified the fundamental tradeoff in the life of mothers:
whether to produce many offspring, investing little in each, or produce a few
and invest a great deal. This idea of"fitness tradeoffs" laid the groundwork for
studying the myriad ways that a mother adjusts maternal investment in line
with ecological conditions. Far from self-sacrificing, the mothers in this
Lackian paradigm were flexible, manipulative opportunists.
    Lack's insights, subsequently refined and expanded by American biologists
George Williams and Robert Trivers, laid the groundwork for evolutionary
biologists to begin to analyze the evolution of social behavior from the per­
spective of each participant. As it happened, the langur monkeys whose
bizarre infanticidal behavior had so riveted my attention when I learned of it,
would provide one of the first tests for the idea that the interests of mothers
and fathers did not necessarily coincide and that males and females behaved as
they did to promote individual reproductive success rather than the contin­
ued survival of the species.
    Mothers Coping with Males
In the summer of I 97 I I traveled to India, where the Japanese biologist Yuki­
maru Sugiyama had first witnessed infanticidal behavior in langur monkeys.
By this time there was a growing consensus that infanticidal behavior was
brought about by human interference and compression of the mon­
keys' ranges into unnaturally crowded habitats. 9 For the next nine years I
would alternate between studying the behavior of these monkeys in a range of
habitats-village to forest-and at different population densities, while
completing my graduate work and holding various teaching positions.
    Early on in my study it became clear that assaults on infants were not ran­
dom acts of violence by stressed animals. Infants were attacked only by
                      A  NEW     VIEW     01'   MOTHERS                        33
strange adult males, ne\'er by males likely to he their fathers. These attacks
occurred when males from outside the breeding system took over one of the
breeding troops and drm·e out the resident male. Then, in a relentless and
goal-directed manner, the newcomer stalked mothers with unweaned infants
and attacked them. Once their infants were eliminated, the mothers became
sexually receptive and solicited the new male. But why, I wondered, were
mothers "rewarding" such behavior by breeding with the same male that
killed their infants? (Note that langur males never copulate unless first
solicited; rape is unknown.)
    By the end of my first field season, I was forced to set aside my original
hypothesis. Rather than pathological, this infanticidal behavior appeared to be
surprisingly adaptive behavior on the part of males. By eliminating the off­
spring of their predecessors, males induced the mother to ovulate again
sooner than she otherwise would have. Thus the killer had compressed repro­
ductive access to her into the brief period he was likely to be present in her
troop (on average twenty-seven months). From the male's point of view, his
behavior was genetically advantageous. But why would any mother go along
with it?
    The main reason was that even though her species as a whole, and her sex
in particular, suffered from retaining the genes of infanticidal males in the
population, mothers could not afford to sexually boycott them. By the time
she lost an infant she had already invested in, she could not afford the further
delay of waiting for a nicer male to show up, one with attributes more benefi­
cial to the sur vival of her species. To postpone ovulating again for that long
would put her at a disadvantage in competition with other mothers who went
ahead and bred with the infanticidal male. Furthermore, the sons of such a
mother would be at a disadvantage in competition with the sons of infantici­
dal males who, instead of waiting around for a chance to breed, took matters
into their own hands by eliminating impediments to their breeding.
    In the case of langur monkeys, a forty-pound male equipped with dagger­
like canine teeth has the advantage of size and weaponry over a female, who
weighs just over half as much. Even if she evades him for a time, or even if her
female relatives intervene on her behalf, as many do, the infanticidal male can
try and try again, day after day, until he finally succeeds. The odds arc stacked
against the mother.
    I knew that in some species (hyenas, for example) females evolved to be
the same size or larger than males and as a result could protect their infants
 34                           LOOK          TO    THE      ANIMALS
Fi g. 2. 2 A langur male seizes an infant sired by his predecessor. (Drawing by Sarah Landry)
better. But animals can evolve larger body size only incrementally, bit by bit
over generations. Being just a little bit bigger helps a female hyena , who, in
addition to fending off cannibalistic group mates, also does better scrambling
at carcasses to stay fed. However, being a little bit bigger is of little use to a
leaf-eating monkey that does not compete with the monkey next to her for
food. Because growing bigger would require delaying maturity, it might even
place a bigger female at a reproductive disadvantage relative to a faster­
maturing smaller one. Being bigger might also make her more vulnerable to
star vation in famine times. There would be all these drawbacks to growing
big without the payoff: being enough bigger so that the mother could prevent
a forty-pound male from killing her infant.
     Infanticide among langurs provides a vivid example of behavior that
clearly did not evolve to benefit the species. The killer gains at the expense of
his infant victim, the rival male who fathered it, and the mother, who loses all
that she has invested in the offspring up to that point. Among langur mon­
keys, where this phenomenon was first studied, recurrent male takeovers
accompanied by infanticide can lead to a decline in group size over time,
                                                                                            10
potentially even the extinction of a particularly vulnerable group.
     Although detrimental to the good of the group, infanticide by unrelated
males and collusion by mothers turns out to be far more widespread than
anyone thought possible. Reported now for some thirty-five different species
                      A   NEW     VIEW     OF    MOTHERS
of primates belonging to sixteen different primate genera, inf::mticidc is often
a significant source of infant mortality. In the most extreme cases, among
mountain gorillas studied at Dian Fosscy's old study site in the Virunga volca­
noes of Zaire, 14 percent of all infants born, and among red howler monkeys
studied in Venezuela 1 2 percent of all infants horn, are killed by marauding
males. 11 Among langur monkeys studied ncar Jodhpur, a team of researchers
under the direction of Indian primatologist S. M. Mohnot and German pri­
matologist Volker Sommer would go on to estimate that over a twenty-five­
                                                                                12
year period, 33 percent if all irifants born were killed by invading males.
Similarly high infant mortality rates from infanticide are also being reported
among one-male troops of chacma baboons living in regions of Botswana.
Elsewhere sa\·anna baboons live in multimalc troops and infanticide is rare,
hut at Moremi single males monopolize breeding only for a brief period.
These short tenures of male access to fertile females intensify male-male
competition for access to fertile females, and increase the selection pressure
on males to compress a mother's reproductive career into the brief period he
has access to her. 13
E\·en in normally gentle and herbivorous primates like langurs and gorillas,
other members of the same species can be a threat to infant survival every bit
as hazardous as lurking predators. This was a new kind of selective pressure
on mothers, one not previously dreamed of. I was beginning to think that the
threat of infanticide might explain something else peculiar about females.
    In the early 1 97os, it was still widely assumed by Darwinians that f emales
were sexually passive and "coy." Female langurs were anything but . When
bands of roving males approached the troop, females would solicit them or
actually leave their troop to go in search of them. On occasion, a female
mated with invaders even though she was already pregnant and not ovulating
(something else nonhuman primates were not supposed to do). Hence, I
speculated that mothers were mating with outside males who mi9ht take over
her troop one day. By casting wide the web of possible paternity, mothers
could increase the prospects of future survival of offspring, since males
almost never attack infants carried by females that, in the biblical sense of the
word, they have "known ." Males use past relations with the mother as a cue to
attack or tolerate her infant. 14
                         LOOK          TO THE  ANIMALS
    Still, how could something so generally deleterious as infanticide evolve?
The answer is sexual selection, a process by which same-sex individuals com­
pete with one another for matings. The loser left few or no offspring.
    Darwinian Sexual Selection
Darwin argued that any trait that enhances survival and thereby increases the
chances that an individual breeds and leaves offspring will be favored by nat­
ural selection. But he was aware of some peculiar variations on this theme­
traits that evolved even though they did not enhance the survival of the
possessor. Such traits seemed to occur most often in males. For example,
Darwin was fascinated by the peacock's elaborate tail and the stag's antlers,
traits that had no apparent survival value and seemed largely ornamental.
Indeed, some of these decorative appendages might actually hinder survival
by using up a scarce resource like calcium for making fancy antlers instead of
making stronger bones. The flashy and cumbersome tail of a peacock would
appear to make the male who possessed it both more conspicuous to its
predators and too clumsy to escape them.
    A hindrance in terms of survival, Darwin suspected that these traits
served a different function. They helped members of one sex compete with
one another for mates. Darwin termed this special subset of the evolutionary
process sexual selection, which he believed had special relevance to human evo­
lution. Thus he titled his major work on the subject The Descent qf Man and
Selection in Relation to Sex ( I 8 7 I ) .
    Sexually selected traits might help individuals outbreed others of the same
sex by outfighting them, dominating them and excluding them from the
scene (the canine teeth of a langur male probably evolved this way), by mak­
ing the possessor more attractive to the opposite sex (like the peacock's tail),
or by canceling a rival's genetic contribution and replacing it with his own (as
did the tendency to kill infants sired by rivals). Sexual selection typically
involved two components: male-male competition for access to females, and
female choice.
   The logic of sexual selection was not just counterintuitive. The idea that
females (supposedly passive, after all) were choosing between mates on the
basis of some secret logic or seemingly whimsical aesthetic preferences
seemed downright incredible. Darwin's most original theory soon fell into
disrepute and was largely forgotten. 15 More than a century elapsed before
scientists in the 1 97os revisited the topic. But when they did, the groundwork
                     t\  NEW     VIEW    01'  MOTHERS
would be laid for explaining why male-male competition tor mates was so
widespread,and why female choice was so important.
    Parental Investment and Female Choice
Although Darwin pointed out tlw importance of sexual selection, he was
\'ague on just why members of one sex (typically males) competed so fero­
ciously for access t<) the other. The explanation would he laid out in a bril­
liantly original paper on "Parental ln\'estmcnt and Sexual Selection" by
RobertTrivers in 1972.
    "Parental im·cstment," according to Trivcrs,is anything that a parent docs
to promote the survival of an offspring that also detracts from the parent's
ability to itwest in other offspring. Fot· most animals,especially mammals,
parental irwestment by mothers and fathers was far from equal. Typically the
male contribution consisted of ejaculation,whereas the female's consisted of
ovulation,gestation, and lactation-a sequence of costly biological processes
that could tie up a mother reproductively for a long time,while the male,if
successful, could go right on breeding.T his inequality in "relative parental
im·estmcnt of the sexes in their young is the key variable controlling the
                                                         16
operation of sexual selection," Trivers wrote in 1972.
    Where one sex im·csts considerably more than the other,"members of the
latter will compete among themselves to mate with members of the former.
Where in\'estment is equal,sexual selection should operate similarly on the
two sexes .... "But if not,"the indivi<lual investing more (usually the female)
is ,·ulnerablc to desertion ." Since in most species fathers invested less than
mothers,competition between males for access to the limiting resource­
potential mothers-was intense. This led to no-holds-barred evolution of any
trait that helped males in this competition,even if it ultimately hurt the
female (as in the case of infanticide). Male efforts to exclude other males,or
herd and sequester females,were all outcomes of sexual selection. Often
attempts by males to control their mates came at the expense of the viability
of mothers and offspring.
    The one area,however,where sexual selection worked to increase rather
than decrease viability of offspring was female mate choice. As researchers
rediscm·ered this topic,an old objection to Darwin's theory lost some of its
power.For female choices were not just aesthetic .     Burgeoning research on
this topic now indicates that females do sometimes select mates on the basis
of cues to the male's genetic merits (what Trivers called "good genes") that
                            LOOK             TO THE ANIMALS
Fig. 2. 3 Displaying peacock (Sarah Bl'!ffir HrdylAnthro-Photo)
can be passed on to offspring-especially in species such as peacocks , where
mates provide little else. Furthermore, the more that males in a given popu­
lation differ genetically from one another, the greater the selection pressure
on females to avoid being monopolized by one-not necessarily the best­
male.17
     Powers of discrimination in the peahen, for example, go beyond whimsi­
cal aesthetics. True, females comparison-shop and then mate with the pea­
cock whose blue and green train of feathers fans out to reveal the largest
eyespots. The "eyes have it," but with a quite practical kicker: recent research
by sociobiologist Marion Petrie demonstrates that seemingly arbitrary pref­
erences for fancy tails can have tangible payoffs. Petrie followed the fates of
chicks sired by different males as part of a carefully controlled experiment
undertaken at England's Whipsnade Park. Offspring of the most ornamented
males grew faster and had better survival rates. 1�
     Since there is no evidence that male peafowl do anything to help offspring,
the most plausible interpretation is that males able to produce the most orna­
mented tails also provide the most viable genes.
The bizarre idea that there may be genetic method to feminine aesthetics
receives support from biologists who measure to the millimeter how sym-
                       A   NEW    VIEW      01' MOTHERS                           39
metrical animals are. Potentially symmetrical traits include the outermost
eyes on the fanned-out tails of peacocks, side feathers of a swallow's tail, two
\v
 · ings on either side of a male scorpionfly, or, in the case of humans, left ver­
sus right ear lobes, cheekbones, jawbones, and dhows. 19
     Scarcely perceptible lopsidedness in bilateral traits like tail feathers is
assumed to he a stress-induced deviation from a perfectly symmetrical ideal
body plan, brought about by environmental insults-pathogens, food short­
age, or inability to metabolize critical nutrients-thus interfering with the
organism's dcn:-lopment. Indeed, the methodology for measuring such "fluc­
tuating asymmetries" (small, random deviations from perfect bilateral agree­
ment in what should be perfectly symmetrical traits) was initially developed
by wildlife biologists worried about the toll on animals taken by changes in
their em·ironment, pollution, diseases, or new parasites.
     In creatures as diverse as earwigs and scorpionflies, finches, swallows , fish,
and at least one mammal-humans-degree of fluctuating asymmetries can
be inversely correlated with large body size, freedom from parasites, and
some measures of performance such as competing for a food item or a mate .
In short, the brightest, most ornamented or symmetrical males arc likely to
he those best suited to prosper in the environment where they grew up or
developed breeding plumage. For females who don't have the option of run­
ning lab tests on potential fathers, such up-to-the-minute indices of physical
                                         20
condition provide the next best thing.
     Following this logic, entomologist Randy Thornhill hypothesized (and
confirmed) that scorpionflies with the most symmetrical wings would have
the highest mating success, and that females could detect which males these
were just hy their scent. Symmetrical males may emit different pheromones,
or perhaps they arc more effective in commandeering the dead insects and
other little prey items that scorpionfly males proffer to potential mates as
nuptial gifts, and this is what catches females' attention. Whatever the reason,
symmetry, performance, and female preferences were all correlated.
     Thornhill teamed up with psychologist Steven Gangcstad to find out
whether the same principle of"fcarful symmetry" that humans find so rivet­
ing in art and metaphor has anything to do with how humans choose sexual
partners. They applied their calipers to the cheeks, eyes, ankles, and elbows
of undergraduates at the University of New Mexico. Men with low scores on
fluctuating asymmetries (who, of course, had no way of knowing this fact
about the various fairly quirky facial and body traits being measured) tended

to be the same subjects who self-reported that
they had found opportunities to engage in sex
earlier, more often, and with significantly more
different partners than did men with higher
scores-but who, as far as most people consciously register, were not per­
ceptibly lopsided. No one knows yet exactly what cues are being used, how
important they actually are in overall human mate choices, or exactly what
any of these burgeoning data sets on human fluctuating asymmetries mean.
However, the evidence suggests that either women somehow pick up tiny
cues of male condition, or self-confidence, or else men in good condition
have an inflated self-image and habitually exaggerate their sexual prowess for
                                              1
the benefit of prying professors. 2
     Let's say that females really are choosing more symmetrical partners. Are
they after better genes in potential fathers, or after protectors and providers
who are bigger and in better condition? The trouble is, we can't yet tease
genetic effects apart from developmental happenstance. For example,
recently discovered correlations between degree of fluctuating asymmetries
and performance on IQ tests can be explained either by better genes for the
relevant abilities inherited from one or both parents, or by favorable condi­
tions early in life-a healthier environment for physical development inside
the mother's womb.22
     But Is It Really "Choice"?
Fieldworkers like Marion Petrie and RandyThornhill rescued Darwin's con­
troversial concept. Female choice would play an important role in burnishing
the emerging image of calculating female strategists, as researchers studying
animals in natural habitats took into account the full range of activities neces­
sary for a mother to reproduce successfully and be "in control."23 But on
closer examination, some of the apparent "choice" in female choices was
more nearly like compromise, or worse. Often females were responding to
offers they could not refuse. For example, when a male langur kills an infant,
                      A   NEW      VIEW      01'  MOTHERS                       41
he essentially nullifies any previous choice the mother might have exercised
in her selection of the father of the killed offspring. By disto1·ting her options,
the infanticidal male constrains the mother to choose him as her next mate.
This is why some sociobiologists, such as Patricia Adair Gowaty, are intent on
learning not only which male a female chooses to mate with (a topic that was
controYcrsial enough in Darwin's time) but which male a female would
choose if her choice Jrere not constrained by otherfactors.
    Gowaty and a consortium of coworkers have embarked on an ambitious
experimental study to discm·er the consequences of male-imposed con­
straints on female choice. When, for example, a male hamadry as baboon
herds females about, or, for that matter, men lock up wives in seraglios, arc
there biological costs? Docs removal of such constraints (Gowaty terms it
"free female choice") result in improved viability for a female's progeny, and
hence greater viability for the species?24
    Early results from a related project--this one under the direction of
William Rice at the UniYersity of California, Santa Cruz-suggests that the
costs borne by females of having mate choices constrained may be consider­
able. A body of slowly accumulating evidence is showing that not only docs
female choice have profound evolutionary implications, so docs its curtail­
ment.
    In a series of staggeringly ambitious experiments, Rice set out to allow
males to cYOlvc while forcing females to stand still in evolutionary time. This
feat was possible because Rice is an experimental geneticist who works with
drosophila, the fast-breeding little fruit flies that materialize in kitchens when
bananas are left out too long. Rice established an elaborate experimental
design im-olving thousands of flies over forty -one generations. In each gener­
ation, males from the "evolving" population were provided females from the
original stock which, through various technically complex manipulations,
Rice held more or less genetically constant through time.
    Although male fruit flies don't out-compete other males by killing their
offspring as langurs do, they usc tactics just as dastardly: toxic molecules in
male seminal fluid that destroy the sperm of males that subsequently mate
with the same female. Unfortunately, after many ejaculations, toxins from
the poisons accumulate in the female's reproductive tract, decreasing her
fecundity and shortening her lifespan. "The more they mate," Rice observes
of the females, "the faster they die." In time, a race of "super males" emerged,
                       LOOK      TO    THE   ANIMALS
especially adapted to this lethal mode of sperm competition, but at a cost.
Because females were taken from the breeding stock and held artificially con­
stant, they had no opportunity to evolve defenses to this chemical warfare
being practiced by their mates. If, for example, females had only been able to
choose among mates, the genes of females who avoided toxic males might
have been selected for, or mothers might have evolved otherwise equipped to
counter toxic sperm. Instead, females prevented from coevolving with these
"sexually antagonistic" mates died at higher rates. Few experiments could
have demonstrated more clearly the extent to which the two sexes "evolve
substantially in response to one another," and not just in response to the phys­
ical environment or to predators. 25
    By the end of the twentieth century, sociobiologists had revealed that
females were anything but passive or sexually coy, and certainly not (except
in Bill Rice's experiments) less evolved. Females were the genetic custodians
of the species, and through their mate choices-when permitted-directed
the course of evolutionary change. Parental investment and female choice not
only called attention to the burdens that motherhood imposes but also
focused attention on the long-standing importance of female autonomy in
reproductive decisions, often synonymous with offspring viability. But if
female decisions were important in the realm of sexual selection, and critical
for selecting progenitors and countering male-male competition, female
"decisions" were even more important in the realm of natural selection gen­
erally.
    Over the course of her life, a female bound for fitness is required to make
a series of physiological and developmental "decisions" about how big to
grow, when to mature, how soon to reproduce, and how much time to allow
between offspring. One of the biggest challenges for understanding selection
pressures on mothers that confronted sociobiologists in the early years was
getting the balance right between considering traits that are sexually selected
(for example, through female choice or male choice) and equally important,
if not more important, female traits that are naturally selected because they
increased the survival of the mother or her offspring.
    The Rare Self-Sacrificing Mother
For each mother, life is a series of turning points and decisions mostly about
how best to allocate resources over the course of her lifetime, be it long or
                       A  NEW    VIEW      OF   MOTHERS                        43
short. Should she put all her eflort into growing big, producing a large num­
ber of ollspring all at once, bn'ed in a single fecund burst like the salmon who
forage in the ocean, swim upstream, spawn, and die? (This is known as scmel­
parity.) Or should she bear fewer offspring, with births spaced at long inter­
vals over a long life (iteroparity), like chimpanzees or humans do?
   A suney of the natural wodd through the lens of this life-historical
approach reveals just how special a creature the self-sacrificing mother envi­
sioned by men like the Ft·cnch physician Gilibcrt must be. Such mothers
exist, hut they do not eYolve as species-typical universals of the female sex
except under the most stringent circumstances. Typically, self-sacrificing
mothers arc found in highly inbred groups, or when mothers are nearing the
end of their reproductive careers. The breed-and-then-die strategy typical of
scmclparous creatures (who reproduce only once in their lifetime) provides
the best examples.
   If semclparity is hard to visualize, think of Charlotte, the altruistic spider
mother in E. B. White's beloved children's book Charlotte's Web. She toils and
spins to lay her single pouch of eggs, and when her life's work is done, she
dies. This is classic scmclparous reproduction.
   A human mother who feels put-upon by the onslaught of child-related
demands when she arrives home after a long day at work may he heartened to
know how much better off she is than one of these more "selfless" mothers.
Scmelparous mothers arc often literally "eaten alive" by their young.
   The prize for "extreme maternal care" goes to one of the various mat­
riphagous (yes, it means mother-eating) spiders. After laying her eggs, an
Australian social spider (Diaea ergandros) continues to store nutrients in a
new batch of eggs-odd, oversized eggs, far too large to pass through her
oviducts, and lacking genetic instructions. Since she breeds only once, what
are they for?
   These eggs arc for eating, not for laying. But to be eaten by whom? As the
spiderlings mature and begin to mill about, the mother becomes strangely
subdued. She starts to turn mushy-hut in a liquefying rather than a senti­
mental way. As her tissue melts, her ravenous young literally suck her up,
starting with her legs and eYcntually devouring the protein-rich eggs dissolv­
ing within her.
    Few things seem quite so antisocial as cannibalism. Yet dining on mother
may be the key ingredient to the evolution of these spiders' unusually grcgar-
44                       LOOK     TO THE ANIMALS
ious lifestyle. By having the bad manners to eat their mother, sated spider­
lings are rendered less likely to eat one another. Furthermore, even among
selfless mothers, not all are equal. There is room for all sorts of selection on
each mother's attributes. The more efficient a mother is at capturing prey, the
bigger she gets; the bigger she is, the bigger the banquet she provides and the
less inclined her progeny are to eat each other and the more her little canni­
                                              26
bals reap the benefits of a social existence.
     How to Succeed in Breeding over a Long Life
Few mammals breed in one semelparous bang. Instead, most are iteroparous,
breeding sequentially over a lifetime. Such mothers may produce young
singly or in litters. For creatures like ourselves, shaped by this iteroparous
potential to breed more than once, it rarely makes sense for a female to put
all her eggs in one basket. An iteroparous mother who overshoots the opti­
mum clutch-size for her circumstances, whose ovaries are bigger than her
larder, may lose her entire brood to star vation or end up so weak she docs not
breed next season when conditions improve. Worse, she may succumb trying.
     Learning just how mothers allocate their time and energy between mak­
ing a living, resting, and reproducing, or caring for infants became the goal of
primatologist Jeanne Altmann. She and her husband, Stuart, had set out in
 1 96 3 to study the ecology and social behavior of baboons on the dusty plains
of Amboseli, in Kenya. Their landmark study, which continues to the present
day, would also provide the first opportunity to investigate the tradeoffs that
primate mothers make . Her research on the ecology of mothers would
emphasize the extent to which every baboon mother is a "dual-career
mother" spending most of each day"making a living": feeding, walking, avoid­
                                                 27
ing predation, while also caring for her infant.
     Acutely sensitive to the problem of observer bias, Jeanne Altmann devel­
oped techniques for choosing subjects at random. She made sure each indi­
vidual was watched for the same number of minutes. Then she used statistical
tests to analyze the results. It was the best available antidote to the all-too­
human habit of seeing only what we expect to sec. In time, such methods for
studying free-ranging animals became standard practice for animal behavior­
ists, and spread into human behavioral ecology. Instead of relying on asking
mothers what they remembered doing, or thought they should do, accurate
                                                                   28
accounts of what mothers were actually doing became available.

"In all aspects of the present study one fact recurs: baboon mothers like most
primate mothers, including humans, are dual-career mothers in a complex
ecological and social setting," Altmann wrote. "They do not take care of their
infants while isolated in small houses or cages, as the rest of baboon life goes
on. They arc an integral part of that life and must continue to function within
it. The baboon world affects them, and they it, through their lifetime."29 With
70 percent of their day going toward making a living, and perhaps another 1 o
to 1 s- percent for resting, these baboon mothers were pushing the envelope
of their own survival. If they were to breed any fast er, they would risk mater­
nal depletion and death.
     Altmann's field research shifted the focus away from what had become an
overemphasis on male-male competition and mate choice hack to natural
                        LOOK     TO THE ANIMALS
selection. In balancing her tradcoffs so as to stay alive and breed, almost every
aspect of a mother's life was shaped by natural selection.
    At the same time, Altmann was managing her own balancing act, raising
two children and doing science under harsh field conditions. She also had
another concern. The study of mother-infant relations was at that time still
widely viewed as the "home economics" of animal behavior, an area of little
theoretical significance. Altmann feared that her hard work would not be
taken seriously. 30 Instead, her 1980 monograph Baboon Mothers and Irifants
became a classic in the study of life-history tradeoffs.
    The Art oflteroparity (Breeding More Than Once)
A female's lifetime reproductive success (or fitness) depends on luck, of
course-everything docs-and, as in the case of Altmann's baboons, on the
phy sical constraints of the environment. In an evolutionary sense, how one
mother fares relative to another depends on how well she handles the series
of tradeoffs she encounters in the course of her entire life. One tradeoff is
between growing larger and maintaining herself (somatic effort) versus
reproductive effort. The second main tradeoff involves how she allocates
bodily resources available for reproduction among offspring. Again, there is a
quantity-versus-quality tradeoff. In some species, such as rabbits and galagos,
mothers invest little in each infant and breed fast; others, like a chimpanzee
or a human, breed slowly over a long life. Others pursue mixed strategies,
alternating according to conditions.
    Golden hamsters, quintessentially flexible breeders adapted to the irregu­
lar rainfall and erratic food supplies of their arid Middle Eastern environ­
ment, illustrate the art of iteroparity -or, how to breed successfully more
than once over a lifetime. In addition to building a nest, licking her pups
clean, protecting and suckling them-all pleasantly maternal-seeming pur­
suits-a mother hamster may also recoup some of her investment in these
pups by eating a few, a time-honored maternal tactic for adjusting litter size
in line with prevailing conditions. Among mice (hut not hamstc1·s), mothers
cull right after birth apparently in an effort to configure litter quality (favor­
ing the heaviest pups) or litter size, occasionally abandoning whole litters if
the number of pups falls below a certain threshold, something much larger
mammals (lions and bears) also do. 31
    Once embarked upon a reproductive trajectory, mothers face new chal­
lenges. How to reconcile conflicting demands of different offspring? Treat

each offspring as equivalent, or value some over others? Should a mother
gamble on an offspring now or reserve herself for some future offspring who
might be born under more promising conditions, or might perhaps be born a
sex that is more advantageous for her to rear? Given that her body is deterio­
rating 0\·er time, when should she throw in the towel, quit producing, and
care for her daughter's offspring instead?
    The Big Mother Hypothesis
When was it worthwhile to delay reproduction and keep growing? Zoologist
Katherine Ralls hypothesized that a big mother could be a better mother.
The standard answer to why males arc bigger than females is sexual selection:
males arc selected to be bigger and stronger than rival males. Females remain
smaller, the ecologically optimal size for their environment-a sort of
default body size. During the 1 97 os, Ralls challenged the fixation with sexual
selection. Playing devil 's advocate, she listed all the mammals in whichfemales
arow laraer than males, an eclectic array of moon rats, musk shrews, chin­
chillas, jackrabbits, cottontails, klipspringers, duikers, water chcvrotains,

     Increasing fecundity with body mass turns out to be one of the main rea­
sons so many invertebrates, such as spiders, have females larger than their
mates. Among species where mothers produce more eggs or young as they
grow older and bigger (the best examples arc fish), females seem to live on
and on until something external kills them. Both fishermen and male fish
seck out these "big mothcrs"-the former for their cachet, the latter for their
greater fecundity. 32 Depending on the species, big mothers produce bigger
babies, deliver larger quantities of rich milk more quickly (as whales do),
outcompctc smaller females so as to monopolize resources available in their
group, or, as spotted hyena females must do, not only defend their place in
the chow line but also defend their infants from carnivorous and extremely
cannibalistic group mates. T he fact that bigger mothers make better mothers
probably explains why the blue whale female grows to 1 96 tons, qualifying
her as the largest mammal in the world. H
     Even among the anthropoid apes, and in spite of a venerable history of
sexually selected males being bigger than females, Ralls's "big mother
hypothesis" helps to explain the emergence around 1 7 million years ago of a

hominid species with females closer in size to that of males. There was a dra­
matic decrease in the degree of sexual dimorphism (size difference between
males and females) in these animals. Homo erectus males and females were
about the same size as humans today, and were just embarking on the lifestyle
characterized by a division of labor between male hunters and female gather­
ers. To understand why Homo erectus females, as well as females belonging to
the closely related genus Homo ergaster, grew twice as large as australo-

pithccine females-of which the famous fossil known as "Lucy" is the best
known-we need to consider selection pressures on mothers.
      Whereas Lucy's mate would have been so percent again larger than she
 was, Missus Erectus's fellow was a mere 2o percent bigger than she was,
around the same order of magnitude as the I s percent or so difference in
body size that characterizes men and women in modern populations. In other
words, both males and females grew larger; but by                                  1 •7 million years ago,
 vdth the emergence of Homo erectus, selection pressures favoring larger body
size became more important for females than for males. Why was this so? For
 a hunter there may be a ceiling on just how large he can grow and sti1l be
 effective in the pursuit of game. Ultimately, though, speculates University of
 California, Davis, paleontologist Henry McHenry, the decline in size differ­
ence between the two sexes had to do with big moms making better moms.
      Once hominid mothers became more terrestrial and traveled farther
afield from their usual escape routes (into trees), were big moms better able
 to defend themselves and their babies? Were they superior foragers, able to
 so                     LOOK       TO THE ANIMALS
push aside big boulders to get at underground tubers? Better able to accom­
modate larger babies passing through the birth canal, and, after birth, to
 carry large, slow-maturing babies long distances? The bigger a mother is, for
example, the more efficiently she manages a heavy burden while striding
along two-legged.34
    Listening to paleontologists ponder these questions today, I think back to
the early I 97os, when in order to hear Katherine Ralls lecture I would trek to
the other side of Harvard Square, far from the Biology Labs (where main­
stream evolution was taught), to the Radcliffe Institute-at that time a
unique forum for women scholars. Ralls's enthusiasm for the "big mother
hy pothesis" was infectious. I can still recall the undisguised glee with which
Ralls (who like me is tall) used to rattle off World Health Organization statis­
tics on the correlation between height and easier, safer childbirth. Other
times, a Jeremiah-like touch of exasperation would enter her voice. "It's so
obvious, why don't they see ...     " how much more to the story there is than
male-male competition and sexual selection!
    Flo's Metamorphosis from Martyr to Dynast
By the end of the twentieth century, the role of Flo, Jane Goodall's most
endearing mother chimp, was expanded and recast. Flo's evident tenderness
and patience were only part of the story about her success as a mother. If in
this book I fail to stress sufficiently this nurturing component, the reason is
that I assume it is already well known, widely described, and commonly
assumed. But there are secrets to Flo's reproductive success that arc less well
known, less often noted.These include Flo's ability to carve out for herself a
secure and productive territory deep within the boundaries patrolled by the
Gombe males. Many of these males were former sexual consorts; others
were her own sons who had risen to a high rank in the fluctuating local hier­
archy.Flo was as secure as a female chimp could he from outside males who
from time to time would raid her community and, if they could, kill not just
unrelated infants but adult males and older females as well.
    But Flo did more than commandeer a productive larder and keep het· off­
spring safe. She supported her offspring politically, permitting Fifi to trans­
late her mother's advantages into her own.At Flo's death, Fifi parlayed her
mother's local connections into the inestimable privilege of philopatry,
remaining in her natal place. Philopatry (which means literally "loving one's
home country") meant that instead of migrating away to find a new place to

       Make no mistake: reproductively, nothing becomes a female more than
remaining among kin. Thus advantaged, Fifi began breeding at an unusually
early age, and so far has produced seven successive offspring, six surviving­
the all-time record for lifetime reproductive success in a wild Great Ape
female. She also holds the record for shortest interval between surviving
births ever reported in wild chimps. Her second-born son, Frodo, has grown
into the largest male on record at Gombe and ranks in the status hierarchy
just below the current alpha male, Fifi's firstborn son, Freud, while Fanni,
Fifi's third-bor n, holds the record for the earliest ever anogenital swelling, at
8. 'i years. Thus docs Flo's family prosper. 37
Early on, Goodall and her students noticed that when Flo approached other
females, they ga,·c nervous pant-grunts and moved out of her way. Females
could be divided into those that held sway and those that gave way. What
.P                       LOOK     TO THE ANIMALS
Goodall did not immediately grasp, however, was why female rank was so
important. We now know that, 9iven the opportunity, a more dominant female
chimp will kill and eat babies born to other females.
    Over the decades that records were kept at Gombe, at least four, possibly
as many as ten, newborn infants were killed by females. When Goodall
reported the first two cases of infant killing and cannibalism by another
mother in I 977, the so-called crimes of a female named Passion, she, like
most people, assumed that the female killing these infants must be deranged .
A few sociobiologists suspected otherwise and suggested that females from a
more dominant lineage were "eliminating a competitor while the infant was
still sufficiently vulnerable to be dispatched with impunity."
    From the     I 97os onward, isolated cases of infanticide by rival mothers
continued to be reported for other species of social mammals-ground
squirrels, prairie dogs, wild dogs, marmosets, some fifty species in all. Most
cases were attributed to either a mineral deficiency or protein lust by a hun­
gry female (since in some cases victims were eaten) or to mothers clearing
out a niche and thereby making resources available for her own breeding
efforts-a model first proposed by sociobiologist Paul Sherman at Cornell
University. As more evidence became available, "the crimes of passion" were
looking more deliberate than anomalous, and in species like chimps, other
females were a hazard that mothers had to watch out for. 38
    Nevertheless, chimpanzees breed so slowly that it was          I 997 before
Goodall and zoologist Anne Pusey had collected enough data to show a statis­
tically significant correlation between female rank and a mother's ability to
keep her infants alive. This finding caused them to reevaluate their long­
standing diagnosis of Passion's "pathological" behavior. When, two decades
after the first cases were reported, Fifi's daughter attacked the daughter of a
subordinate female, Pusey assumed it was a failed attempt at infanticide.
    Mother chimps like Flo, then, were not simply doting nurturers but
entrepreneurial dy nasts as well. A female's quest for status-her ambition, if
y ou will-has become inseparable from her ability to keep her offspring and
grand-offspring alive . Far from conflicting with maternity, such a female's
"ambitious" tendencies arc part and parcel of maternal success.
    Paradigms Widened
Darwin had set up a revolutionary new framework for understanding the
behavior unfolding before us in the natural world, hut it took another century
                      A  NEW      YIEW    OF   MOTHERS
to expand that paradigm to include the full 1·ange of selection pressures on
both sexes. Ont' reason it took so long to fully assess the female side of the
equation was that competition between females tends to he more subtle than
the boisterous, often Yiolent, roaring and bellowing of males. Female mam­
mals tend to confine overt competition to the spheres that actually matter in
terms of status and their ability to produce high-quality offspring.
    Se,·cral changes contributed to the new awareness of reproductive varia­
tion among mothers. In addition to the theoretical shift to focus on individu­
als, field studies were lasting longer, decades rather than months. Also, more
women were doing field research. In 1 8H Antoinette Brown Blackwell had
lamented that "Only a woman can approach [evolution) from a feminine
standpoint and there arc none but beginners among us in this class of investi­
gations."!'> A century later, 37 percent of Ph.D.s in biology in the United
States were being awarded to women , and the proportion in the field of ani­
mal beha,·ior was about the same. Although male and female researchers do
science the same way, they may he attracted to different problems. The
upshot of all these factors was that this time, when distaff Darwinians tapped
male evolutionists on the shoulder, many of the latter were primed to
respond.40
    By the late 1 98os, prominent male biologists were joining their women
colleagues in pointing out the need to correct "inadvertent machismo" in
their respecth·e fields. Some of them made points similar to those Eliot,
Blackwell, and Royer had tried to communicate more than a century earlier.
"Research in biology," renowned entomologist William Eberhard noted, "has
traditionally been carried out mainly by men rather than by women, and it is
possible that, as has happened in the social sciences, research may sometimes
be inadvertently influenced by male-centered outlooks."41
    Wherewr the evolution of reproductive strategies was studied, the
importance of taking into account the reproductive interests of all players
inmh-ed-female or male, adult or immature-was increasingly recognized .
Whether in entomology, primatology, ornithology, or human behavioral
ecology, researchers rushed-like prospectors in a gold rush-- to seck the
mother lode of new insight to be had from incorporating females' as well as
males' perspectives into their research.
    Scientific observation of animals living in their natural environments dur­
ing the last decades of the twentieth century yielded a far more dynamic and
multifaceted portrait of female nature than anything previously imagined.

Most surprising were all the ways that mothers influence their offspring's
development through both genetic (including female choice) and nongenetic
effects. The updated image of old Flo, for example, allows us a glimpse into
the significance of such "maternal effects." Fifi, Flo's daughter, entered the
world advantaged by her mother's rank, a maternal effect that pointed to ever
more subtle ways-beyond genetically inherited attributes and succor­
through which mothers influence the fates of their offspring. By the end of
the twentieth century, the spotlight shifted so as to begin to illuminate in rig­
orous and controlled studies how organisms develop in specific contexts.
Development would turn out to be the critical missing link in evolutionary
thinking.

 0           ne reason for our fascination with Princess Diana is her
             Cinderella-like life story: unknown ingenue transformed into a
             future queen. Beekeepers routinely make such fairy tales come
true just by arranging for the eggs or young larvae (less than three days old)
to be fed a substance called "royal jelly."
   As an egg or larva, females arc totipotent, able to develop into several dif­
ferent forms. In the honeybee world, in which "you are what you eat," a
female's lot in life-what one might think of as her class (strictly speaking,
her "caste")-is determined not by her genes but by what her nurses feed
her and by the reproductive oppression of dominant individuals. Ditto for
what we might call her gender-whether or not she becomes an imperious
mother or servile spinster sister.
   At oviposition, the egg that will be queen is placed in a special compart­
ment. She spends her prh·ilcgcd lar vahood being fed a chemical concoc­
tion-royal jelly-prepared in the salivary glands of her nurses. The body of
the immature, specially fed individual matures so as to differ from the ordi­
nary worker in fifty-three different morphological and behavioral respects.
Instead of becoming a sterile worker who will never produce an offspring,
she blossoms into a fecund queen who will produce several million of them. 1
Two females with virtually identical oenotypes (genetic composition at con-

ception) look forward to two utterly different destinies. Intervening events
resulting in these different outcomes constitute the underlying mysteries.
    The Importance ofDeveloprnent
Even prior to merging of sperm with egg, even before there is anything that
could be thought of as a conceptus, an embryo, or an "organism," future pos­
sibilities arc being shaped by the ambient surroundings of the germ cells .In
mammals, these surroundings are influenced by the mother's internal state,
by nutrients in the protoplasm a mother adds to her eggs, or, as in the case of
honeybees, by nutrients provided by other members of the colony.
    The mysterious development of individuals, or ontogeny, includes all
those complex and opportunistic emergent processes that affect how each
genotype develops into the phenotype, the tangible properties of the organism
that are influenced but never entirely determined by genes. 2 Phenotype is
one of those awkward umbrella terms that began narrow, then opened up
through time to cover a larger area. Today the term is still used in the original
way, to describe specific ways that genes arc expressed (as in a particular eye
color or blood type); but phenotype is also used to refer to an entire organ­
ism, or its behavior.
    The important point here is that all anyone ever sees, touches, or directly
experiences is phenotypes, neYer genes. It is phenotypes that interface with
the world and interact with others in it. Only phenotypes arc directly
exposed to natural selection. This is why, evolutionarily speaking, and espe­
cially for those like me who study behavior, phenotypes are what matters.
    Phenotypes arc produced by interactions between genes and other envi­
ronmental or parental influences.They can be affected by all kinds of vari­
ables-how much cytoplasm the mother delivers in the egg, what other
chemicals she adds, what time of year it is, what the mother is eating at the
time, diseases she might have, even her own recent social history.This is why
sociobiologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard can state so adamantly: "Nothing is
genetically determined in the sense of determined by genes alone. No gene is
expressed except under particular cin:umstances .... It's a kind of biologi­
cal illiteracy to talk about a gene.for anything other than a particular protein
molecule."l
    West-Eberhard is not saying that genes don't mattet· but rather that their
powers are inseparable from context, including both external context and
          U N L> E H. L Y I N G .l\1 Y S T E R I E S 0 l' L> E V E L 0 P M E N T lj]
the deyeJopmental context, since genes act by influencing a responsive struc­
ture that is already there. This is true at every level, from immune-system
defenses at the cellular leYel to character at the personality level . It is as
absurd to talk about behavior being "genetically determined" as it is to claim
that genes have nothing to do with behavior.
    It is profoundly incorrect to equate "genetic" with "biological," a term that
covers far more than just genetic pmcesses. It is also incorrect to treat nature
and nurture as separable entities, as in saying "The genes interact with the
environment," or "Nurture does not matter." This is why it is unfortunate to
hear the label "biological mother" applied to a woman who has given birth to
a child and giYen it up for adoption, or, worse, just provided the donor egg.
Such a woman is more nearly the genetic or gestational mother. By contrast to a
genetic donor, the biological mother nourishes, nurtures, and provides the
cnYironmcnt in which the infant develops both physically and psychologi­
callY. 4
    It is clear that genes arc not puppeteers directing behavior. A range of non­
genetic factors, such as mother's physical condition or social status, the sea­
son when she conceived, her own diet or the one she provided her baby, the
presence or absence of father-all contribute to individualization. Parental
effects encompass all the nongenetically transmitted attributes that pass from
parent to offspring. Practically speaking, the mediators of such effects are
often mothers. Not hereditary in any genetic sense, maternal effects can nev­
ertheless influence the speed and course of evolutionary change, trends that
sooner or later lead to changes in gene frequency-the stuff of evolution.
    The dynamics of genetic and maternal effects are relatively better under­
stood in the mother-centered worlds of hymenopteran social insects­
honeybees, wasps, and ants-than they arc in other animals. A finite number
of chemical signals chart an individual's life course, thus permitting scientists
to carry out rigorously controlled experiments showing how a specific treat­
ment (such as feeding royal jelly) plays out during development. One of the
ironies of the charge "genetic determinism" so often leveled at sociobiologists
is that so many of its earliest practitioners-Edward 0. Wilson, Mary Jane
West-Eberhard, William Hamilton, and Richard Alexander-were also ento­
mologists. They were acutely aware that genetics does not equal biology.
They didn't call the new field sociogenetics; they called it sociobiology-for
a reason.

    Mother-Centered Worlds
Nineteenth-century evolutionists knew that traits were inherited, but they
did not know of the existence of genes or understand how they worked. They
lacked a way of conceptualizing the complicated relationship between inher-

ited traits and altcrnati\'e outcomes, or phenotypes. As late as the I 9 )OS most
animal hcha,·iorists still took it for granted that relatively brainless, culture­
less creatures like honeybees were horn to function instinctively in a nar­
rowly specified, or species-typical, way. Workers were predestined from
birth to serve the queen and maintain the efficiency of the hive.
    In 1894, Darwin's associate Thomas Henry Huxley could write confi­
dently-in what he considered a progressive statement-that the "vast and
fundamental difference between bee society and human society" was that
bees "arc each organically predestined to the performance of one particular
class of functions only," while among men "there is no such predestination."
Among men "it cannot be said that one is fitted by his organization to be an
agricultural laborer and nothing else, and another to be a landowner and
                ,;
notI1mg
      .   cI se.
    No modern sociobiologist would disagree with Huxley's assessment that
each human individual is born with variable potential. But most would
emphatically disagree with Huxley's assumption that the lot of a hymenop­
teran insect was quite so narrowly predestined. Far from strict destiny-a
direct equation of genotype with phenotype-a honeybee's gender is merely
a potential. E,·en in an organism born so mindless as a bee, a creature who
learns remarkably little in the course of her life, a female has the potential to
become either a worker or a queen, depending on the type of nurture she
receiYes. Even whether or not a worker remains sterile or takes a stab at lay­
ing eggs turns out to be negotiable.
    Gender, Relatedness, and Caste
The reproductive subservience of worker castes is not quite so voluntary as
believed. The honeybee queen manufactures a special "queen substance" in
her mandibular gland that broadcasts an imperious olfactory message inform­
ing workers of the hive: "Develop your ovaries and you're dcad!"The hor­
monal signals (or pheromones) that the queen uses to broadcast this message
are derh·ed from ancient hormones emitted by one insect to threaten another
in the course of female-female competition.6 In response to peremptory
pheromonal signals passed bee-to-bee during food exchange, the workers'
ovaries shut down. Yet occasionally-in spite of all this propaganda-a
worker may attempt to lay eggs. But her efforts are usually in vain. Her eggs
will most likely be cannibalized by other females who detect them.
6o                        LOOK    TO THE ANIMALS
    Ovarian despotism by dominant females has been especially well studied
in the genus Polistes. These hornet-like wasps range throughout North Amer­
ica and down to Central America. They sting like fire. Fortunately, though,
many species are easy to spot due to conspicuous black, yellow, and burnt
sienna body bands . If it is summer outside, paper wasps are probably, at this
moment, busily constructing parchment-like nests of chewed wood pulp in
the eaves of your building.
    In an ingeniously simple manipulation, Mary Jane West-Eberhard-who
for many years has studied the tropical paper wasps ncar her homes in
Colombia and Costa Rica-tethered a reproductive female some distance
from where her eggs had been laid by tying a slender nylon thread around the
wasp's waist. As soon as this dominant female was prevented from aggres­
sively defending exclusive access to the nest, the previously suppressed
ovaries of her daughters revved up and they began laying eggs. 7
    Seemingly utopian, the paper wasps' society is more nearly an ovarian
police state. This does not necessarily mean there is no future to unauthorized
fecundity. Some Argentinean ants give destiny a helpful nudge by assas­
sinating the dominant female, usurping her breeding prerogatives for them­
selves. 8 More often, however, the better part of valor for a worker in these
mother-centered, mother-dominated societies turns out to be helping their
foundress-or, once the colony gets going, their sister-to rear her off­
spring.
    Even in honeybees, which, most would agree, do approximate buzzing
automatons, genes do not determine outcome in life decisions as major as
whether to become a mother. Rather, genes set limits on a range of develop­
mental outcomes, which are very few compared with the situation in
humans, where the range of outcomes is enormous-albeit still not infinitc.9
    Genes, with all their limitations, nevertheless play a very special role in
the puzzle posed by highly cooperative breeding colonies of social insects. If
all living things strive to reproduce, as Darwin theorized, how could one
explain the dedication of the altruistic worker bees who will never reproduce
and transmit genes to future generations?This challenge to Darwinian theory
yielded to an ingenious solution proposed in        1 96 3 by British geneticist
W illiam Hamilton. This reserved and self-effacing young scientist came up
with a bold idea-selection at the level of kin-to explain the altruism of the

    Hamilton's Rule
The civic-mindedness of sterile workers earns honeybees the utopian desig­
nation eusocial (or, "perfectly social"), which applies to any society with over­
lapping generations devoted to the cooperative care of immatures and
characterized by specialized reproductive and nonreproductive castes.
Although young are produced in great quantity, it is the quality of the care
that enables so many to survive. Busy workers spend the first three weeks of
their short lives in the hive, tending their sister's young, and their next (and
final) three weeks foraging for nectar in the riskier world outside.
    To explain this world, Hamilton drew on his knowledge of the special
reproductive attributes of social insects. He proposed that hymenopteran
social insects so often put the colony's interests ahead of their own because of
an especially close degree of genetic relatedness between the workers and the
queen. This comes about because of an odd biological circumstance by which
males have just one set of chromosomes (haploid), while females have two sets
(diploid), so that organisms such as wasps engage in "haplodiploid" reproduc­
tion. In haplodiploid organisms, two sisters with the same father will share
more genes in common than a mother shares with her own offspring.12
    Primitive as they may seem, even insects have hidden zones of ovarian
decision-making. Once a honeybee queen or a reproductive wasp mates, she
stores the sperm in a special pouch called a spermatheca. When she lays an
egg, she has the option of opening a valve, permitting sperm to fertilize it as
it passes through her reproductive tract. A fertilized egg with two sets of
chromosomes (diploid) develops into a daughter. As with most sexually
reproducing animals, the resulting daughter receives half of her chromo­
somes from her mother, the other half from the male with whom the queen
mated. But if the queen withholds sperm, something unusual happens.
The unfertilized egg develops anyway, but it develops into a haploid individ­
ual with only one set of chromosomes, derived entirely from her. Hap­
loid eggs always develop into sons. Since any male the queen mates with is
haploid, this creates a peculiar skew for her female offspring, such that sis­
ters arc especially closely related. This is why the genetic payoff for a worker
investing   in  the   queen's   offspring   is greater   than  if she   produced
her own. Male honeybees don't have this same especially close relation­
ship to the queen's offspring and also don't meet this same test of citizenship.
    These drones, or "winged sperm dispensers" (as Ed Wilson terms them),
         UNDERLYING           MYSTERIES        OF   nEVELOJ>MENT               63
live only long enough to mate and then die. Afte1· reaching adulthood, they
spend a few days in the nest before taking off for their big (also final) moment
on the mating llight. Nonmating males arc either driven out of the colony or
        ll
killed.
    Instead of focusing on the sterile w01·ker's genetic representation in the
next generation -    which would he zero-Hamilton expanded the concept of
an individual's lifetinw reproductive success (orfitness) to include the inclusive
fitness of the individual. By inclush·e fitness Hamilton meant the effect that
the female worker's hehavio1· has on her own fitness plus the efl'ccts her
heha,·ior has on the titncss of close kin who share genes by common descent.
Using this principle, Hamilton derived simple mathematical expressions pre­
dicting that altruism should evolve whenever the cost to the giver (which
he designated C) was less than the fitness benefits (B) obtained hy helping
another individual who was related by r, a term designating the proportion of
genes these two individuals shared by common descent. 14
    Hamilton's decepth·cly simple-looking equation C < Br underlies the evo­
lution of helping behavior in all social creatures. The rule together with the
general theory behind kin selection were almost immediately confirmed by
West-Eberhard for wasps, 15 and soon after for many other animals.16 At an
ultimate le,·cl, kin selection explains the universal human pattern of favoring
kin. In humans different beliefs and customs underlie these patterns, hut the
outcome is everywhere the same: kin preferred to nonkin. 17 Indeed, as we
will sec, many unexpected features of maternal behavior can be understood
as special cases of Hamilton's rule.
    No gene or set of genes, or even any one mechanism influencing people
to favor kin, has been identified. We do not know even a fraction of the ways
that kin selection works. Yet wherever biologists or anthropologists have
looked, animals, including people, behave as if there were such genes. One
way or another (and, as I say, nobody un<lerstands how) all social creatures
have through evolutionary time-probably in different ways-internalized
                   8
Hamilton's rule. 1 In humans we can only assume that our powerful predispo­
sition to prefer our own kin derives from very ancient emotional and cogni­
tive systems, such as learning to recognize people familiar from a very early
age and having a lower threshold for altruism in our behavior toward them.
This is the simplest explanation for our similarities with other social crea­
tures in this respect.
                         LOOK     TO THE ANIMALS
As Hamilton expressed it:
    (In theory) a gene causing altruistic behaviour towards brothers or sis­
    ters will be selected only if the behaviour and the circumstances are
    generally such that the gain is more than twice the loss. . . . To put the
    matter more vividly, an animal acting on this principle would sacrifice
    its life if it could thereby save more than two brothers, but not for
    less. 19
And this is where the matter has stood for many years, the emphasis in "kin
selection" on the close relatedness of the actors.
    However, not all social insects with remarkably cooperative breeding sys­
tems have this kind of special haplodiploid reproduction. (Termites, for
example, do not.) For this reason, attention has begun to shift to the other
components of Hamilton's initial equation: the ratio of costs and benefits to
actors. T he honeybee queen, recall, grows up to be a specialist in egg-laying.
She is a super-mother in a class by herself, a female of enlarged ovaries, able
to lay an egg a minute, day and night, for up to five years. Her worker sister,
on the other hand, even if she manages to produce some eggs, has severely
limited prospects of rearing them. How much, then, does a sterile worker
actually give up by altr uistically helping her mother or her sister reproduce,
accepting a fractional interest in millions of eggs instead of laying a few ill­
fated ones herself? W hat are the costs in relation to benefits, given the
females' degree of relatedness?
    By themselves, the peculiarities of haplodiploid genetic systems do not
fully explain why ants, wasps, bees, termites, and other eusocial insects must
be counted among nature's longest-lived and most fecund success stories.
Something else is needed to explain 140 million years of eusocial prosperity.
We need to keep in mind Mother Nature's cardinal rule for mothers: It's not
enough to produce offspring; to succeed through evolutionary time mothers
must produce offspring who will survive and prosper. In short, we need to
consider the importance of what I think of as "the daycare factor."
    In an unrivaled reproductive success story, expeditions ofleaf-cutting and
harvester ants blaze trails across the forest floor, while battalions of army ants
terrorize mammals in their path. Bees and wasps dot trees with their nests,
          UNDERLYING         MYSTERIES         OF     DEVELOPMENT               6)
and termites infest rotting wood. One-third of the animal biomass of the
Amazonian rain forest teems, climbs, and swarms with billions upon billions
                         20
of these social insects.
    The secret to their success is, quite simply, the most dedicated and effi­
cient daycare in the biosphere. So what if some army-ant queens can lay up
to two million eggs? A woman starts out her life with more than three times
that many egg cells. It's not the insect queen's fecundity that is so special, it's
her success rate translating eggs into adult survivors. What makes social
insects so amazing is the dedicated assistance of all those allomothers. Even
if the mother dies, so long as the colony persists, her progeny will he cared
for. 21 It is a mother-centered world geared toward one aim: the survival of
progeny.
    Controlling Mothers?
She's a real Queen Bee! We usc the term, often with a tinge of disapproba­
tion, to describe a despot, a figure in charge. It's one of those metaphors that
on closer inspection is more apt than people realize. But even without a
quecndom, some solitary wasp mothers who do not found large breeding
cooperati\·es-like the fig wasp mother who breeds alone-nevertheless
manage to exercise remarkable control over their posterity. Their power
derives from their ability to predetermine the sex of each offspring.
    William Hamilton showed how a solitar y mother fig wasp ruthlessly
manipulates her progeny in ways that suit her long-term reproductive inter­
ests. As the female lays each egg, she either fertilizes it or not, thus determin­
ing the exact configuration of daughters and sons, which she can translate
into the greatest number of grand-offspring. Out of a batch of 257 eggs, one
mother produced 2 35 daughters and just 2 2 sons. To explain this wildly
female-biased sex ratio, Hamilton devised a theory based on local competi­
tion for mates, generally referred to as "local mate competition."
    Local mate competition?What could a mother's production of sons versus
daughters possibly have to do with competition to breed? Normally not
much, not in outbred creatures like ourselves who avoid mating with full sib­
lings. But in the incestuous world of the fig wasp, the number of daughters
for every son matters a great deal. The wasp mother's brood will he born, and
breed, right there within the fleshy pink confines of the fig. "Local mate com­
petition" is an understatement. Brothers born just a hairsbreadth away from
one another wait outside the nursery until the sisters hatch, then usc their

Fig. 3·3 Some Hymenoptera are social, but most arc solitary. Here a gravid wasp tunnels into a
fi g and lays her eggs in gall flowers, where they will mature. Such males as the mother wasp pro­
duces emerge first and fight among themselves to gain access to females, who emerge shortly
after. The newly inseminated females then struggle clear of the fig where they were born and fly
off to find a new one. In the process, pollen from the first fig is transported to a new fig that will
serve first as a nursery and next as a seraglio to her progeny, then as a tomb for the mother and

      reflection, this seems unfair in a situation that can only be likened in
      human terms to a darkened room full of jostling people among whom,

    When Hamilton spent a year in Brazil doing fieldwork on fig wasps, he
kept a special Yial lahcled C-A-R-N-A-G-E to collect the body parts of males.
He estimates that a million sons arc murdered each time a fig tree fruits. Such
is the stage the mother sets. And for what?

sen sex ratio is the one that makes the most efficient usc of all the bodily
resources she has to allocate to reproduction. She produces only as many sons
as arc needed to fertilize her daughters. Readers of A. S. Byatt's allegorical
fantasy Morpho EuHenia, about a Victorian country estate eerily reminiscent of
a social insect quecndom, will he relieved to know that the theme of brother­
sister incest docs not derive from any special information she possesses about
the sordid underside of domestic life in Victorian households (although, who
knows?) as much as from the author's knowledge of Hymenoptera. In the
book's film Yersion, AnHels and Insects, the matriarch's daughters wear fabu­
lous Hymcnoptcra-styled ball gowns, complete with wasp-waists and flam­
boyant yellow and black stripes.
By the end of the 1 97os, manipulative mother wasps had upended the stereo­
type of a passiYe, nonstrategizing, "egg-laying" machine-at least among the
entomological cognoscenti. Previously, the idea of mothers manipulating the
sex of their offspring, or controlling the reproductive careers of other
females, seemed more like science fiction than science. But natural history
was once again proving stranger than fiction.
    An arcane subficld known as "sex ratio theory" arose within sociobiology
to deal with the complexities of mothers who bias production of offspring
toward either sons or daughters, and of parents who bias investment toward
offspring of one or the other sex-a preoccupation among human parents as
well (sec chapter      q, below). The study of biased investment in sons and
daughters illustrates what Hamilton refers to as his own "perverse, unscxy,

yet fundamental (geneticist's) angle" on reproduction.
    Confirmation from the Jewel Wasp
Within decades, what at first seemed to some almost delusional speculations
about adapth·e control of sex ratios by mothers yielded spectacularly precise
science. The organism whose bchaYior would confirm the validity of Hamil-

Fig. 3 ·4 William D. Hamilton describes the incestuous microcosm inside a fig, while evolutionary
theorist Robert Trivers looks on. Hamilton's 1967 article "Extraordinary Sex Ratios" explained
why the mother fig wasp produces mostly daughters. I used to attend their seminars, bringing
my infant daughter with me. Since she was asleep in a canvas carry-all, my hands were free to

ton's theory of local mate competition in every detail, the jewel in this
crown, was an unlikely candidate in al1 but name. Nasonia vitripennis is a tiny
parasitoid wasp, smaller than a fruit fly, with the unsavory habit of laying eggs
on the pupae of blowflies laid under carcasses and in birds' nests . This parasite
upon a parasite is commonly known as the jewel wasp.
     The parasitic jewel wasp, turns out to be, in the words of biologist John
Werren, "a consummate artist at controlling the sex of [her] offspring." Simi­
lar to Hamilton's fig wasps, jewel wasp mothers locate a blowfly pupa and lay
eggs, most of which will hatch as daughters, with just enough sons-perhaps
 ' 5 percent of the eggs-to inseminate them.               Unattractive as their housing
requirements happen to be, space is in short supply. W hat happens, John Wer­
ren wondered, if the mother arrives at her host, injects her stinger (which is
also a sensory organ) into the mush, only to detect chemically that another
mother got there first and had already deposited her eggs? At that point, this
family-planner par excellence inserts only a single, unfertilized (and there­
fore male) egg. Her son will hatch into a world full of opportunities: he wil1
join the fray with sons of the first female, competing to copulate with her
daughters.

    Yet even a mother so much in control as the jewel wasp rarely has the last
word. 'Nerren discovered a "parasite" upon this calculating parasite. About 1 o
percent of jewel wasps carry a particular virus-like gene known as "the pater­
nal sex ratio clement." If the male the mother mates with carries it, that mate
transmits it to her in his sperm. This parasitic gene destroys the paternal
chromosomes in all the eggs that she fertilizes, converting all diploid eggs
into haploid ones. The fertilized eggs that normally would have developed
into daughters become sons, the only sex host capable of transmitting the
parasitic gene. This parasite upon a parasite upon a parasite could theoreti­
cally cause jewel wasps to become extinct by artificially producing an all­
male population.
    But Wcrren, with the geneticist's optimism that every dilemma is only a
mutation away from some sort of solution, chose to look on the bright side.
Instead of predicting extinction, he quotes Jonathan Swift:
    So, Nat'ralists observe, a Flea
    Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey;
   And these have smallerfleas to bite 'em
   And so proceed ad infinitum. 24
By the     1 97os, then, entomologists exploring cooperative infant rearing,
maternal manipulation of sex ratios, and suppression of ovulation were not
just discovering new dimensions to being female; they were uncovering new
dimensions to individuality that had to do with development. Hamilton's rule
provided sociobiologists with a universal truth: it applied to all social organ­
isms, all other thin9s bein9 equal. But when are all other things ever equal?

    Maternal Effects
For species such as primates, the mother is the environment, or at least the
most important feature in it during the most perilous phase in any individ­
ual's existence. Her luck, plus how well she copes with her world-its
70                      LOOK      TO THE ANIMALS
scarcities, its predators, its pathogens, along with her conspccifics in it-are
what determine whether or not a fertilization ever counts.
    What mothers are and do can facilitate or impede adaptation to new
conditions, impart to immaturcs a mother's own immunological defenses
(through lactation) or otherwise give youngsters a boost. These head-start
programs can begin even before fertilization (see Plate 1 ).
    During the late seventeenth century, scientists thought they saw a minia­
ture man, a little "homunculus," through their microscopes, folded up inside
a human sperm, waiting to be deposited inside the womb. Even after 1 8 2 7,
when embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer provided a more accurate descrip­
tion of the mammalian egg and convinced his colleagues that miniature
humans were not planted ready-made into the uteruses of women, 25 it con­
tinued to be assumed for another century that males alone directed the
course of evolution. Even though mothers contributed egg cells, they were
viewed as passive vessels, awaiting the life force conveyed by males.
    But this, too, was not quite right. Rather than being penetrated by a
sperm, the egg (or oocyte) more nearly engulfs it, quite possibly selecting
which sperm to accept, and producing specific chemicals that arc necessary
for fertilization to take place. The sperm cell is almost pure nucleus; the
oocyte contains several ingredients-nucleus and cytoplasm. Once the
sperm is inside the egg, maternally transmitted instructions go to work.
Nutrients stockpiled prior to fertilization supply the needs of the developing
embryo. In particular, the mother's oocyte is derived from cells that, even
prior to fertilization, have begun dividing. Prior to any contact with the
sperm, the maternal germ cell has divided four times, into sixteen cells. One
of these continues on as the oocyte. The others become "nurse cells," which
manufacture nutrients and other materials that will he transmitted through
                  6
the cytoplasm. 2
   This means that early embryonic development is under maternal control
before the father's genes, carried by the sperm, arc even activated. At the
outset, the egg's acceptance of a sperm launches maternal effects. Proto­
plasm from the mother sets up the embryo for development, prelude to
many possible maternal effects.
    One of the strangest and least anticipated maternal effects ever described
has to do with just such special ingredients transmitted by the mother to
the cytoplasm in her eggs. It is a case that belies all stereotypical expecta­
tions about maternal virtue, defying the conventional expectation that a

"madonna" ought to make a more suitable mother
than a "whore." In this instance, it is thefemmesfatales
who make the best mothers.
    Imagine flashing lights blinking on a sultry night.
But these lights arc not inviting summer vacationers
to visit discos. The strobe effect emanates from lumi­
nous, phosphorescent organs on the abdomens of
Photuris fireflies. These female fireflies emit chemi­
cally produced flashes of light that mimic the mate­
attracting signal of another species, a type of firefly
belonging to the related genus Photinus, in which
females really did e\'Olve to signal readiness to mate
by flashing and males evolved through sexual selec­
tion to seek them out when they did. But when an
eager Photinus suitor shows up, the alluring Photuris female eats him instead of
mating with him.
    The Photuris-mother-to-bc gets more than a meal out of this male. She also
gets his armor, since her victim has the unusual capacity to manufacture
defensive steroids that make him unpalatable to birds and predatory spiders.
The mother promptly passes this chemical protection on to the eggs she is
laying, endowing them with her chemical booty. 27
Such cases arc the stock-in-trade of those sociobiologists like Mary Jane
West-Eberhard who focus on development. To her, individualization begins
as a maternal effect. "An animal egg or a plant seed is already a highly orga­
nized and active phenotype before it is fertilized." She entreats us to consider
the beginning of a frog's life. Hours after fertilization, with the fast-dividing
blastula (the early development phase of an animal) already 4,ooo cells
strong, none of the embryo's own genes have been activated. The only
instructions to be had arc from hormones and proteins circulating in the

                                         to their offspring. Thus, through the trickery of
                                         their mothers, Photuris offspring enjoy an

cytoplasm. Far from genetically determined, initial development of this new
individual, with its "hand-me-down phenotype," is very much influenced by
maternal condition, her nutritional status or life history. This is what West­
Ebcrhard means when she scoffs that "The bare genes arc among the most
impotent and useless materials imaginable." Thus the phenotype of the early
embryo is determined hy the mother alone. This represents a maternal eflect

undreamed of before the dosing years of the twentieth century.
    Wcst-Eberhard has been foremost among those working to integrate
behavioral plasticity in both sexes into evolutionary theory. W hat fascinates
this wasp specialist is the extent to which genetically similar individuals can
be shunted into different pathways of development according to conditions
encountered early in life. The identical genotype (or at least genotypes that
arc very similar, as in full siblings) could develop into an organism that looks
                                                                                  29
or behaves very differently (that is, exhibits a different phenotype).
    The phenomenon of environmentally cued alternative phenotypes within
the same population is known as polyphenism (i.e ., same genotype produces
more than one phenotype). Long overlooked, polyphenism, the outcome of
so many underlying mysteries, is assuming greater importance in the thinking
of geneticists. Anyone tempted by cascading research that identifies genes
"for" particular traits would do well to keep these cases in mind, as reminders
of how much context still matters.
    Catkins orTwigs
The reason all the best examples of polyphcnism derive from plants and
insects rather than \·ertchrates is purdy practical. To obtain unambiguous
experimental results requires the experimenter to rear identical individuals
         UNDERLYING           MYSTERIES         01'  DEVELOPMENT                73
under different conditions. Distinctive life-forms (or morphs) found in easy­
to-manipulate insects, together with their short lifespans, means that study
subjects can grow up, hreed, die, and yield definitive results quickly-before
funding to study them runs out.
    My faYorite example comes from caterpillars belonging to a species of
gcometrid moths (Ncmoria arizonaria) that breed in oak woodlands across the
American Southwest. Entomologist Erick Greene used these caterpillars
to demonstrate how different diets early in life produce utterly different
morphs--organisms as different as two species. In the process, Greene
showed how peculiar contingencies of a mother's existence-whether she
gave birth early in the season or later-factor into the shapes her offspring
must assume to survive.
    In the case of the gcometrid moths, mothers hatch two broods of caterpil­
lars each year. In nature, spring broods feed on the protein-rich pollen of the
oak's drooping flowers, called catkins. Long after these kittens' tails (their
name derives from the Dutch diminutive, katte, precisely because of this
resemblance) have dropped from the trees, the second (summer) brood of
caterpillars hatches. Since the catkins are gone, all that is left for summer
caterpillars are tough, mature oak leaves, laden with tannins, which arc poi­
sonous compounds produced by oaks to discourage nibblers. But in a world
where caterpillars arc what they eat, these tough leaves are just the ticket.
    Whereas pollen-eating grubs metamorphose into knobby, wrinkled cater­
pillars that resemble oak stamens, looking to all the world (especially to hun­
gry birds that prey on insect larvae but not plants) like drooping catkins,
later-born morphs are gray-green, less knobby, and utterly twiglike, blending
in with their leafy dinner and once again fooling predators. High levels of tan­
nin from the leaves (or something associated with them) trigger the develop­
ment of this twiglike morph.
    Greene's elegant experiments showed that the pathway taken by the
genetically coded developmental program is triggered by what the caterpillar
eats in the first three days. If early broods eat fibery leaves instead of pollen,
they, too, come to resemble twigs. 30
    The nutritionally superior catkin diet permits spring broods to attain a
larger size by the time they pupate, to mature faster, survive better, and (once
they become moths) to be more fecund breeders. Despite the disadvantages
of being born late, caterpillar lines that failed to produce summer broods
miss out on the opportunity to breed twice in the same year.

Figs. 3. 7a and b When Erick Greene experimentally fed full sibs of the caterpillar Nemoria ari­
zonaria different diets, two different morphs developed. Spring and summer broods look the
same when they first hatch, but subsequently the early-born (spring) broods feed on oak catkins
and grow up to look like drooping flowers. Later-born (summer) broods subsist on leaves and
develop into alternative morphs camouflaged as twigs. If summer broods were artificially fed
out-of-season catkin meals, they would stand out like solitary kitten's tails within an inland sea of
twigs and leaves, easily spotted by predators. (Reprinted .-;rh permissionfrom Science 243:644. © 1989 American

      Alternative Outcomes of Development
Genetically identical individuals can grow up to be very different-that is, to
have very different phenotypes-depending on circumstances encountered
early in development. These flexible phenotypes result in different "morphs"
or types of individuals . Simply put, in varied and unpredictable worlds there
will be more than one way to survive and reproduce. Through the course of
development, individuals adopt alternative strategies, manifested either in
their morphology and physical appearance or in their behavior. Resulting
phenotypes depend on circumstances, on which genes or receptors are
switched on, which cellular and bodily responses triggered. Alternate pheno­
types, or ways of being, are coded right into the genetic constitution (or
genome) of the same individual.
      Polyphcnism, with its multiple developmental courses, is too useful a con­
cept to confine to "simple" creatures like wasps and caterpillars. Increasingly,
biologists arc aware that mammals--including primates like ourselves-can
develop along different pathways, even assume different forms or cxhihit
quite different behavioral profiles, depending on what developmental track
they find themselves on. However, the underlying mysteries in large-bodied,
socially complex, and long-lived organisms arc far harder to pin down exper-

imentally, and none of the cases could be so well documented as in the honey­
bees and caterpillars. Consider the "Peter Pan" orangutans.
    Researchers engaged in long-term studies of orangutans in the wild have
long been puzzled by the curious case of males who never seem to grow up.
The "Peter Pans" arc so different from full adult males that the legendary nat­
uralist Alfred Russell Wallace (the codiscoverer of Darwin's theory of natural
selection), on encountering one, assumed he belonged to a different species.
Various biologists since have made the same mistake.
    The two orangutan body types (or morphs) are characterized by utterly
different patterns of growth and reproduction; year after year, the same
males get classified as adolescents-in some cases, for as long as twenty
years. But if, one day, the dominant male disappears, the Peter Pan male
undergoes a transformation: within months his face fills out, his hair grows,
and he accumulates bulk. Abandoning his low profile for the life of a bully, it is
Peter Pan's turn to patrol the forest like a quarrelsome troubadour in quest of
a maiden, uttering deep roars and fighting any other adult male he meets. 31
    Primatologists Peter Rodman and Birute Galdikas, who study orangs in
the forests of Borneo, have described the low-cost, low-benefit mating strat­
egy pursued by undersized, adolescent-looking males who skulk about
females and copulate with them even though they are not sexually receptive.
(Galdikas labels this the "sneak/rape" strategy, the only thing approaching
rape in a primate other than humans.) Such males are seemingly unselective,
attempting to copulate as often as possible, even at times of her cycle when
the female is unlikely to conceive.
    By contrast, a full adult male is more discriminating and concentrates on
ovulating females. Such a male fiercely defends access to one, and fights to the
death to drh·e rival males from her vicinity, thus maximizing his chance of
being the father of her next offspring. This "combat/consort" strategy is far
more costly than the sneaker's tactics in terms of risk to the male from com­
bat. Furthermore, the adult male's discriminating standards mean that big
males copulate only rarely (ovulating female orangs being an exceedingly
scarce commodity in these highly dispersed and slow-breeding apes). Never­
theless, such copulations as the consorting big males do obtain are more
likely to culminate in conception.
    West-Eberhard was so impressed by the evolutionary possibilities of this
kind of variation-far more common than generally realized-that she sug-

Figs. 3. Sa and bThe orang on the left is a "developmentally arrested" Peter Pan male. On the right
is a full adult male with beard and full check flanges. He has much higher testosterone levels, and
exudes a musky odor. Developmentally arrested males maintain a low profile and attract less
aggression from dominant males. But as soon as the locally dominant male is rcmm·cd, the Peter
Pan male grows up, develops protruding check flanges, and emits long calls, turning into the very
model of a Darwinian male who (as described in the Descent rf Man) "expends much force in
fierce contests with his rivals, in wandering about in search of the female, in exerting his \'Oicc,
pouring out odoriferous secretions, etc." (Photos byjessie Cohen, Narional :t.oaloaical Park,© Smirhsoman /nrrirurion)
gested organisms may use multiple morphologies or lifestyles (say, eating one
food rather than another) to "experiment" with new niches. If the trial run
proves successful, and animals pursuing this new lifestyle survive and repro­
duce better, then new evolutionary opportunities are opened up. For exam­
ple , a population of caterpillars could conceivably evolve to specialize in eating
leaves high in tannins all the time. Or (to really engage in science fiction), if
forest fires continued to burn in Indonesia and food was chronically short,
selection might favor a Peter Pan morph who was inclined to never grow big.
     Multiple phenotypes provide natural selection an opportunity to either
favor or penalize genetic combinations that predispose animals to live some
novel way. Such phenotypic flexibility means that evolution and speciation
can occur at a faster pace than would otherwise be possihle.12
     Memes and Other Special Maternal Effects
In terms of evolution, some of the most stunning maternal effects a1·c pro­
duced by information about the world communicated by a mother to her
infant. Such information can be transmitted chemically ( cxpc1·iments with
rats show that food choices later in life arc inf1ucnccd by molecules in

mother's milk) or through cultural concepts, which is possible only in species
endowed with language and symbolic reasoning. Though there may have been

               .
of these capacities to<I ay. B
                 .
    The hand that rocks the cradle rarely controls the world. But the voice
that sings the lullabies and barks cautionary messages in the first years of life
proYides critical information about the social niche into which the child has
been horn. Such experiences can have a lasting effect upon his mental and
emotional outlook. Through her example and direct teaching, a mother
shapes critical assumptions about how the world works, what there is to cat,
who there is to be afraid of, who is likely to he well-disposed, and so forth­
myriad units of culturally transmitted information, or"memes."34
    Human self-images and beliefs are not frozen and continue to change
through life as individuals (active agents in their own right) encounter new
social opportunities and constraints. But the fact that immature humans are
so impressionable has evolutionary consequences out of proportion to the
brief time period when immatures are intimately exposed to their mothers
and to her immediate circumstances, or"local history."
    A distinguished roster of evolutionists (including Ernst Mayr, John Emlen,
George Williams, Edward 0. Wilson, and Richard Dawkins) have all com­
mented on the extraordinary gullibility of our species, especially when we
are young. Call children gullible, or "learning ready," but their spongelike
aptitudes function to spare small and vulnerable creatures the fatal costs of
learning through trial and error. "Don't go near the water," and especially
"Don't tease the saber-tooth tiger," are the examples that came to the grand­
fatherly mind of George Williams. 35 One reason television is such a perilous
medium is that even infants less than two years old imitate what they see on
the screen, yet ·what appears there is determined by what happens to appeal
or to sell rather than by what behavior helped individuals in a particular past
environment to survive or prosper.
    Few geneticists question the importance of maternal effects or early
learning since they know that the course of evolution (used here to mean
changes in gene frequency) can be altered by nothing more substantial than a
powerful idea acquired early. A Hutterite daughter who imbibes Anabaptist
doctrine along with her mother's milk is more likely to grow up to bear ten
children (the average for her group) and be the least likely of any woman in
any population ever studied to die without surviving offspring. 36 Meanwhile,
                          LOOK     TO   THE    ANIMALS
another little girl down the way, who grows up convinced of Christ's immi­
nent second coming, and who as a consequence joins a religious community
such as that of the celibate Shaking Quakers, decreases her odds of bearing
any children at all.
    In part II, I will return to what is the most important of all maternal
effects in terms of infant survival: a mother's decisions about how much to
invest in her offspring, and in some cases even whether to nurture her infant
at all. In part III, I speculate about the significance of maternal commitment
for what the developing human infant learns about its social environment.
From      1975   onward,    sociobiologists   began   to  incorporate  situation­
dependent phenotypes and maternal effects, along with natural selection, kin
selection, and sexual selection, into our understanding of evolution. "Look­
ing to the animals" in this new way made it inevitable that sooner or later
mothers would be recognized as playing active and variable roles on the evo­
lutionary stage. But other factors, including new protagonists among the the­
ory builders, sped up the revision. An explosion of field studies by an
increasingly diverse group of researchers in animal behavior and human

          very female who becomes a mother does it her way. From an evolu­
          tionary perspecth·e, what mothers have in common is their high and
          quite certain degree of relatedness to each infant. What varies are the
costs that caring for a particular infant will impose and the potential payoff in
terms of that offspring's prospects of translating her investment into subse­
quent reproducth·e success. So far as natural selection is concerned, mother­
ing is anything and everything a female does to ensure genetic representation
in subsequent generations. Narrower prescriptions implying that every
mother would be a fully committed, "loving" mother were just somebody's
wishful thinking.
   When sociobiologists followed the advice of early moralists by looking "to
the animals," they did so not in search of moral guidance but to learn why
creatures behave as they do. Instead of natural laws demonstrating how moth­
ers should behave, nature yielded a series of contingent statements. Whether
or not a female produces offspring depends on her age, status, and physical
condition. Whether or not, and how much, she commits to such offspring as
she bears depends on her circumstances, and-in cooperative breeders like
humans- on who else is around to help her.

    Incorporating Mothers into the Evolutionary Process
Through the choice of the males with whom she mates, the bodily resources
she provides her developing young, and the social microcosm she creates for
them, each mother's legacy is twofold. It includes the intertwined non­
genetic and genetic endowments, which are very difficult to tease apart.
    Back in the earliest days of evolutionary thinking, long before the Austrian
monk and botanist Gregor Mendel showed how genes work, and long before
Darwinian thinking merged with population genetics to produce the "new
synthesis" of the mid-twentieth century, one of the very first evolutionists,
the great eighteenth-century French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, had
proposed that a mother passed on the traits she acquired during her lifetime.
The oft-cited example was the giraffe's neck, supposedly stretched long by
years of high browsing, and passed from mother to offspring. With the rise of
Darwinian, and especially genetic, thinking, Lamarck's ideas were set aside as
impossibly quaint. Now biologists realize that there are important respects in
which nongenetic, acquired attributes-like immunities, templates for rec­
ognizing relatives, social networks-pass between generations as "maternal
effects," attributes that arc inherited, but not as genes.
    Tandem transmission of genetic and acquired attributes means that
modern evolutionary theorists are having to combine Darwin, Mendel, and
Lamarck into one interactive and cumbersome maternal situation. Com­
pared with maternal effects, understanding paternal contributions would be
relatively simple were it not for the fact that male reproductive strategies can
rarely be understood apart from what mothers are doing.
    All through the 1 97os, in the years before sociobiology fully incorporated
the new view of mothers as complex, variable creatures, there was a wide­
spread presumption that "Most adult females in most animal populations are
likely to be breeding at or close to the theoretical limit of their capacity to
produce or rear young . . ." while, by contrast, with regard to males, it was
assumed that "there is always the possibility of doing bctter."1
    Researchers fixated on simple measures like "counting cops"-primatolo­
gists' slang for counting the number of times each male copulates. But in
species where maternal reproductive success varies a great deal, the number
of matings provides only a crude and unreliable measure of any given male's
reproductive success. Whether a copulation results in surviving offspring will
depend on a whole range of contingencies having to do with which female a
                          UNIMAGINABLE              VARIATION                            81
male mates with. Unless mating results in production of offspring who them­
sell·es survi1·c irifancy and the jm·enilc years and position themselves so as to reproduce,
sex is only so much sound and undulation signifying nothing. 2
     Consideration of maternal effects and other underlying mysteries takes
evolutionists beyond the habitual questions raised by sexual selection theory,
and the staple of so many sociobiological studies: "Will she or won't she?"
"Can he or can't he?" More recently, questions like "Which mother?" and
"Under what circumstances?" have become more important.
     vVhereas males would be under heavy selection pressure to best rival after
rival just to gain opportunities to copulate one more time, females have no
need to compete for mates in this way. This correct generalization was often
misunderstood to mean that females lacked any "preadaptation for competi­
tion" or any "genetic predisposition toward the creation of hierarchy," which
was rarely true. 3 It was certainly not true if one takes into account those
aspects of mothers' lives where competition matters.
     Darwin's ingenious theory of sexual selection promoted a blinding hubris.
If evolutionists could explain male strategies for out-competing other males
and inseminating the most females, they could explain the different natures
of males and females. The trouble was that this crown jewel of evolutionary
theory, tailor-made as it was to explain competition between males, was
poorly suited to explain the many preoccupations of females. Important
sources of variance in the reproductive success of one female compared to
another were overlooked.
     Factors that were routinely overlooked in those early days included the
female's age at first birth, the duration of the intervals between her births ,
social factors influencing whether her infants live or die, or even whether she
reproduces at all. Nor did it always register that unless mothers gauged their
reproductive effort in line with fluctuating resources and other prevailing
conditions, few would manage to rear infants that survived. The poorly
adapted or unlucky would die trying.
     Viewing mothers the old way, no one had paid much attention to these
sources of variation.4 For example, when Jeanne Altmann first showed that
high- and low-ranking baboon mothers at Amboseli differed in their proba­
bilities of giving birth to a son versus a daughter, few knew what to make of
it. Many found it hard to believe, because in order to understand what was
going on one also had to take into account the social and ecological context in
82                      LOOK      TO THE ANIMALS
which each mother was operating, and to understand that baboon daughters
born to low-ranking females were less likely to survive than sons were. Why?
Studies of captive macaques with a similar social system provide one reason.
Higher-ranking females in the same group harass mothers with daughters
(the sex of offspring that will remain in the natal group and compete with her
own daughters) but leave low-ranking mothers with sons alone. As a conse­
quence, infant daughters suffer higher mortality than would sons born to
mothers of the same low rank. 5
    With the support of their mothers and other matrilineal kin, daughters
born to high-ranking baboon females rise in the hierarchy and, in turn, pass
on the advantages of their acquired rank (along with such perks as early
reproductive maturity, and greater offspring survival) to daughters. The
female baboon, like most social mammals, introduces her baby into the net­
work of social relationships she has forged. Daughters who grow up sur­
rounded by high-ranking kin give birth at an earlier age to offspring more
likely to survive. Since baboon daughters inherit their rank from their
mother, these social advantages are transmitted across generations as mater­
nal effects, and the reproductive advantages accumulate through time in her
matriline. But this strange bias in production of progeny only made sense in
the Jight of variation between females. 6
    Prior to sociobiology, females had been lumped together as a class, as if to
see one was to see them all. By obscuring variation between one female and
another, researchers also inadvertently obscured the extent to which natural
selection has operated on this sex. In retrospect, it seems absurd that half the
species could have been lumped into a homogeneous group this way-until
we take into account the nineteenth-century contexts in which evolutionary
theory emerged. Once again, the idea goes back to Victorian evolutionists
like Spencer who observed that with the exception of fecund insect queens, a
successful male can produce more surviving offspring, or have greater repro­
ductive success, than females.
    From fruit flies to humankind, it was taken as axiomatic that all females
mate and become mothers, while among males only the luckiest or most
competitive manage to become fathers. 7 It seemed to follow that the repro­
ductive success of different mothers would be more or less equivalent, while
that among males would vary tremendously. The greater reproductive poten­
tial of males was one reason that biologists focused on their behavior. Another
reason was that competition between males was so conspicuous and exciting.
                        UNIMAGINABLE                 VARIATION
Females, by contrast, were viewed as plodding constants whose steady per­
formance could be taken for granted.
     Convinced that the most important variation occurs between males, some
twentieth-century biologists-like Spencer-still assumed that females
were less evoh·ed than males. Why? Because variation in the reproductive success
<?[one indi1•idual rclatii·e to another is essentialfor natural selection to occur. No vari­
ation, no selection. No selection, no evolution.
     Variation and Selection
The old premise that selection acts more strongly on males than females was
uncritically carried forward into modern evolutionary thought. Indisputably,
sexual selection weighs heavily on male traits that affect their access to mates.
But competition for mates is not the only sphere where Mother Nature is at
work. The theory brilliantly illuminates the obsessive concerns of Othello,
but casts little light on Desdemona beyond clarifying why it would be neces­
sary for her to counter such detrimental effects as being suspected, chased,
herded, dominated, sequestered, punished for straying, or (switching now to
another Shakespeare play, Titus Andronicus) having offspring sired by a male
other than her mate killed.
     Males and females pursue different reproductive strategies. Theoretically,
males compete for fertilizations, trying to inseminate as many females as pos­
sible. There is a strict limit, on the other hand, to how many times a female
benefits from insemination. Her reproductive success depends not on num­
ber of fertilizations but on the contingencies of her life, the qualities of the
mates she chooses, and, above all, how succesiful she is at keeping alive such
ir:fants as she does produce.
     By the last quarter of the twentieth century, a previously undreamed of
variation in reproductive success from one female relative to another was
being documented. At the same time, unexpected-even previously unimag­
inable-sources of this variation were being unveiled. 8
     Not So Coy Females
Darwin assumed that females were "coy," holding themselves in reserve for
the one best male. Yet field studies for primates suggested that, once again,
the behavior of females was more variable than expected. Females could be
"promiscuous," like males, if by that term we mean attempting to mate with
many partners. But to what end? Given that a female could support only one

Fig. 4.1 Lucky Moulay Ismail the Bloodthirsty of Morocco ( 1646-172 7) has earned a double
immortality. His first derives from an astonishing reproductive success, supposedly 40 sons born
in the space of one three-month period in 1704, leading to an impressive lifetime total of 888
offspring born to his many wives and concubines. Moulay's second source of immortality derives
from his frequent citation by sociobiologists who used him as a chestnut to illustrate the enor­
mous gulf separating a "big loser" (zero offspring) and a "big winner" like him. The world's
records for maternity pales by comparison .
     Pity poor Madalena Carnauba in Brazil who married at thirteen and gave birth to thirty-two
children (fates unknown). A woman, even if feu ad libitum like a Strasbourg goose and provided
ample wet nurses, would still be constrained hy inter-birth intervals that inevitably spread out
with the rest of her as she approaches menopause. Theoretically, a man's life-long sperm produc­
tion means that only the duration of refractory pt'riods after ejaculation, declining sperm counts,
or access to ovulating women limit his fertility. Hence he always has a chance of doing better.
     Fine, so far as this scoring system goes. But even the potency of a potentate should not be
considered in a vacuum. How many offspring actually survive? For balance, shouldn't we also be
discussing Moulay Ismail's mother, about whom almost nothing is known? Was she anything like
Moulay's own scheming empress, Zidana? Based on a few details about Zidana that survived, she
was quite effective at discrediting rivals and eliminating thdr sons from the line of succession.

pregnancy at a time, why would she do this? Such solicitations not only take
time and energy, but render females vulnerable to attacks li·om other males,
and expose them to sexually transmitted diseases.
    Consider the case of chimpanzees. A female chimp mates on average 138
times with some thirteen different males for every infant she gives birth to.
Female bonobos also mate many more times than is necessary for concep­
tion, as do other species of primates living in multimale groups, such as bar­
bary macaques and baboons. 9
    In 1997 the first-ever paternity tests from a population of West African
chimps were analyzed, with unanticipated results. Samples of hair from
inl::mts, their mothers, and from the males in their community were ob­
tained, and DNA markers from the hair were compared . The researchers had
assumed that chimps live in more or less discrete communities whose bound­
aries were patrolled by bands of related males who share access to females in
the community. These bands of males were not just defending food resources
within their territorial boundaries but also the breeding females who live
there. W hen Pascal Gagneux, David Woodruff, and Christophe Boesch ana­
lyzed the genetic data, however, they found that just over half the infants born
in this community (seven out of thirteen births) were sired by outside males.
The fathers not only lived outside the study sample, but included males that
the observers had never even seen the female traveling with, much less mat­
ing with.10
    Undetected by observers, female chimps were slipping away to solicit
outsiders in spite of appalling risks. Lone chimps caught trespassing in terri­
tories patrolled by other chimps may be viciously attacked, bitten to death.
Even if males tolerate a "foreign" female sporting the bright-pink swellings in
her anogenital region that signal ovulation, resident females may not honor
that particular passport. Wandering through unfamiliar terrain also makes a
female more vulnerable to predation, not to mention the risk of disease. (It is
almost certainly no coincidence that the virus causing AIDS evolved in
chimps. Promiscuous habits provide the perfect niche for a sexually­
transmitted virus.)
    Why, then, in spite of all these drawbacks did female chimps furtively
leave their home communities to breed? Were all the resident males simply
too familiar? Were the females behaving so as to avoid inbreeding? Was it
because males next-door seemed genetically superior in some way that was
86                      LOOK     TO THE      ANIMALS
communicated to females? Were females manipulating the information avail­
able to males about paternity as insurance lest one or more of these males
invade their community one day ?
    Mother's Sexual History as a Maternal Effect
In the wild, baby chimps are born to mothers who, on average, have mated
more than a hundred times with as many as a dozen or more different males.
The mother's frenetic (if transient) libido would make it impossible for any
male to be cer tain of paternity. Never theless, so long as the female mates
only with males in her local community, those males will still tend to be
related as uncle, cousin, or grandfather to offspring sired by their relations.
The possibility that an unrelated male might grow up undetected in the local
breeding fraternity would be a serious threat to the breeding integrity of
these "brotherhoods." Community males would not be expected to welcome
another community's son in their midst-and apparently they do not.
    Offspring born to a mother like Flo, secure in her feeding range deep
inside the ter ritorial boundaries of the community, would be safe enough.
There, she and her y oung are less exposed to incursions by males from other
communities than are mothers on the margins. If Flo ever bred with an out­
side male, it would have been on her own terms-perhaps during a furtive
visit undetected by her community's resident males. But females living in
home ranges at the edge of the community are less fortunate. According to
Japanese primatologist Mariko Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, offspring of these moth­
ers are at double jeopardy, likely to be killed by males in neighboring com­
munities as well as by males in their own who suspect their mothers of having
consorted with the enemy. W hen offspring of these mothers at community
margins arc killed, Hiraiwa-Hasegawa reports, sons are more likely to be the
  . .                       II
victims than daughtcrs are.
    Langur males, however, differ from male chimps in this respect. They vir­
tually never attack any infant born to females with whom they have mated,
even if she has mated with other males as well. That is, unlike chimps, langur
males err on the conser vative side of the margin of error that surrounds
paternity. They attack only if they can he certain the offspring is not theirs­
unlike chimps (for example), who tolerate only those infants they can he con­
fident were sired by members of their fraternal interest group.
    Among the langurs studied by German primatologist Carola Borries in
lowland forests of Nepal, infanticide accounts for 30 to 6o percent of all

 Fig. 4· 2 "No case," Darwin confessed , "interested and perplexed me so much as the brightly col­
 ored hinder ends and adjoining parts of certain primates." In about one-fifth of all primate
 species, tissue in the anogenital region fills with fluid and turns bright pink around the time a
 female ovulates. Normally swellings last just days-·a week at most. But bonobo females like
 these remain swollen and eager to initiate sex for up to three weeks at a stretch. "Sexual
 swellings" evolved at least three different times in the Primate order, almost always in species
 where females reside in groups with multiple adult males. If females evolved to be sexually dis­
 criminating and "coy," as Darwin assumed, why do these species so blatantly advertise their
 receptivity and not only solicit but copulate with many partners , many times? (Courtesy 'IfAmy Parish)
 infant mortality. DNA evidence indicates that none of the infants killed could
 have been sired by the males who killed them. Even a completely unrelated
 infant will be accepted in the group, so long as it is being carried by a familiar
 female. It is the mother and her past relationship with the male that provide
 the cue for a male to either tolerate or attack a particular infant. As with the
femmesfatales fireflies, the mother's recent sexual history would be an example
                                                                                          12
 of a maternal effect with life-or-death consequences for her progeny.
      This new awareness of female reproductive interests is transforming
 our understanding of animal mating systems. Wherever males attempt to
 constrain female reproductive options, we can expect selection for traits
 that help females to evade them. What are we to make of such far-flung
 solicitations and enterprising sexuality as are being documented for creatures
 as diverse as fireflies, langurs, and chimps? After all, applied to females,
 pejorative-sounding words like "promiscuous" only make sense from the per-
88                       LOOK      TO THE      ANIMALS
spective of the males who had been attempting to control them-no doubt
the origin of such famous dichotomies as that between "madonna" and
"whore." From the perspective of the female, however, her behavior is better
understood as "assiduously maternal." For this is a mother doing all that she
can to secure the survival of her offspring.
    Whatever else these apes and monkeys are up to, it is obvious that select­
ing the one best male from available suitors-as Darwin imagined female
choice would work-is scarcely the whole story. Females are also actively
manipulating information available to males about paternity.
    Is a male animal capable of remembering whether he mated with a partic­
ular female? The best experimental evidence testing the proposition that he
can derives not from the langur monkeys, who first inspired the hypothesis
about confusing paternity, but from European sparrows called dunnocks . A
male dunnock acts as if he can not only recall which females he mated with,
but how likely copulations at a particular time were to result in conception.
    Female dunnocks live in cooperative breeding groups in which a female
solicits multiple males. These males, in turn, help provision the chicks more
or less in proportion to how much opportunity they had to inseminate the
mother when she was last fer tile. According to Nick Davies of Cambridge
University, both alpha and subordinate males were significantly more likely
to bring food to young they fathered, or even young they mi9ht have fathered.
And just as the "several possible fathers" hypothesis would predict, DNA
fingerprinting (which pins down paternity more precisely than human
observers possibly could) revealed that males were often but not always accu­
rate in their guesstimates.
    Pro-Choice Mammals
Mothers in cooperatively breeding species are especially sensitive to who in
their vicinity is likely either to help or hinder their reproductive endeavors.
Mothers calibrate their reproductive effort according to which males, with
which intentions , and which females arc also present. After birth, how much
a given mother invests may depend on particular attributes of her litter, its
size, the ratio of sons to daughters in the litter, or even the qualities of partic­
ular offspring. Deteriorating social conditions, loss of helpful kin or a mate,
or the presence of dangerous strangers can have a profound effect on mater­
nal commitment.
                       UNIMAGINABLE           VARIATION
    The California mouse is an unusual rodent, not just because it is socially
monogamous hut because both members of the monogamous pair arc com­
pletely faithful to their partners, and never mate with others. This is because
mothers with the help of mates rear four times as many pups to weaning age
as do single mothers, so both sexes arc better off staying rather than straying.
Outside of capti\'ity, the presence of a male is absolutely essential to rear a
large litter, to keep the pups warm and fed. Mothers who lose their mates
may kill their pups rather than attempt to rear the litter alone. 13
    In the California mouse, mothers eliminate offspring after birth if they
lack assistance from a male. A far more common pattern among other species
of rodents, howc\'cr, is for a mother to terminate investment prior to birth
because she has reason to fear male inteiference. In house mice, deer mice,
Djungerian hamsters, collared lemmings, and some species of voles, preg­
nant females respond to the arrival of a strange, potentially infanticidal male
in their territory by reabsorbing their embryos. 14 With this efficient form of
early-stage abortion, the female avoids the even greater misfortune of losing
a full-term litter later on. Early-pregnancy reabsorption triggered by the
smell of unfamiliar males is known as the "Bruce effect," after biologist Hilda
Bruce, who in 1959 first reported it, even though the phenomenon was not
then understood. 15
    E\'en in strains of mice that experimenters already knew to be infanticidal,
not all individuals arc equally likely to kill young. In some strains, almost all
males arc infanticidal; in others, only males of a certain "type" kill infants. For
example, only socially dominant males may be infanticidal, or only males that
could not possibly be the father of any infants they encounter because they
ha,·e not ejaculated in the past twenty-one days, the equivalent of one mouse
                    16
gestation period.
    In  I 994, biologists Glenn Perrigo and Frederick vom Saal described a
unique neural safeguard system in mice that ensures males do not kill their
own infants. An internal "clock" starts up in response to ejaculation and
thereafter keeps track of light-dark cycles for a period of two months. This
unusual timer adaptivcly schedules a male mouse's transformation from cad
into dad and hack to cad. The male who has ejaculated becomes noninfantici­
dal long enough for any pups he might have sired to be gestated, born,
weaned, and out of the way. After that, males revert to their infanticidal ways
until they mate again. It was the "switch in time that saves mine," quipped
                       LOOK      TO   THE    ANIMALS
Irish biologist Robert Elwood, describing the transformation from the per­
spective of a male rodent.
    As with most really critical functions, Mother Nature has retained redun­
dant safeguards. In addition to the "switches in time," there are more primi­
tive fallback systems so males can be absolutely certain not to kill their own
young. Hence, a male in most mouse strains can be induced to keep right on
being tolerant toward infants long after the first litter is weaned, so long as he
remains in contact with his mate, or with her smell. Somehow (probably
through androgen-mediated pheromones), females can assess which males
are and which aren't infanticidal. Pregnancies were significantly more likely
to be reabsorbed when the mother encountered a mouse that the observers
already knew from other evidence was likely to be an infanticidal male.17
    Reabsorption of embryos-the most efficient way to terminate a preg­
nancy-is not physically possible in primates. However, pregnant monkeys
(baboons, langurs, geladas, and other monkeys) whose social groups have
been recently usurped by a new male have been reported to spontaneously
abort.18
    At first, it seems counterintuitive that any female would ever produce
fewer offspring than she is capable of, much less terminate investment in a
fetus or an infant in whom she has already invested so much. But the art of
iteroparity (or, breeding more than once over a lifetime) involves knowing
when to cut your losses and weather poor conditions, the sooner to breed
again under better ones.
    In species where survival of young requires extensive care, the single most
important source of variation in female reproductive success is not how many
young are born; what matters is how many sur vive and grow up to reproduce
themselves.19 For such creatures, survival of at least some young requires
reproductive discretion. This is why being pro-life means being pro-choice.
    The Importance of Allomothers
In most animals (reptiles, fish, insects), the mother lays her eggs and takes
off. When a mother does care for her young, she does so alone. In many
species of birds, and in about 1 o percent of mammals, including a tiny frac­
tion of primates (humans and a few species of monkeys and prosimians that
bear multiple young), infant survival depends on the mother being assisted
by others-the father and/ or various individuals other than the parents-

alloparents. Sometimes, as in social insects, or the rare case of naked mole
                                                                 20
rats, such individuals provide more care than the mother docs.
    Ornithologists used to call such assistants "helpers"; primatologists called
them "aunts" (after the British "auntie," to designate a female relative or
trusted family friend). In 1 97), Edward 0. Wilson decided it was time for a
more dignified designation: allo- (from the G1·cck for "other than") plus par­
ent. Since it is only the wise animal behaviorist with access to DNA finger­
printing who knows for sure who the father is, it would he more precise to
confine ourseh·cs to the term allomoth ers  -  mcaning all the caretakers other
than the mother (whose identity we arc likely to know for sure) who help
care for or provision young.
    Although it may seem odd to refer to a male caretaker as an allomother, all
this means is that he is an individual other than the mother helping the mother
care for her infant. However we define them, alloparcnts play critical roles in
all coopcratiYC-brecding species and in many primate societies where such
assistance allows mothers to breed at a much faster rate than would other­
wise be possible. Among humans living in foraging societies, a helpful mate
and/ or alloparcnts were usually essential for a mother to rear any infant at
all. In a surprisingly broad range of creatures, indispensable alloparents pro­
vide many of the same forms of care a mother might, protecting and provi­
sioning, even suckling another female's infant in cases where the alloparent is
lactating.
    Communal suckling is most often reported where mothers live among
their matrilineal kin, as do elephants, dwarf mongooses, prairie dogs, lions,
ruffed lemurs, cebus monkeys, and bats. 21 Occasionally, however, dominant
mothers force unrelated females to provide milk, as in the case of some
wolves or wild dogs. The hired wet-nursing that Linnaeus and Gilibcrt so
objected to was essentially a case of our highly inventive species consciously
converging on a solution similar to that already found in nature.
    Just as the labor of legions of larvac-minders has earned social insects the
prize for greatest biomass, alloparcntal assistance permits some mammals to
rear young under difficult conditions, to breed fast, or to rear young that are
especially costly because they are large, quite numerous, or slow-growing. As
we will sec in part II, alloparcnting is particularly well developed and played
a special role in the evolution of our own large-brained, slow-growing, and
extraordinarily im·entivc species.

    Those Who Can, Breed; Kin Who Can't, Help Out
With their big litters and fast-growing, costly young, the dwarf mongoose of
East Africa provides a classic example of cooperative breeding. Typically only
the oldest female in a large group breeds, but all help her rear her young.
Each animal takes a turn as baby-sitter or sentinel, standing upright on the
vast arid savanna, vigilantly scanning the horizon for predators. Why do other
females, themselves sufficiently mature to breed, forgo ovulating and help
their kin rear super-litters instead?
    Research by Purdue University behavioral ecologist Scott Creel illumi­
nates the physiological underpinnings of this odd breeding system. The
rule among dwarf mongooses, as among honeybees and other cooperative
breeders, is clear: T hose who can, breed, while those who can't, help out.
Assistance to mothers rearing these super-litters is provided primarily by
subordinate females who act so much like real mothers that, although they
have never been pregnant, they spontaneously lactate to feed their charges.
Harassed and often underweight, these subordinates could not hope to pro­
vide for a whole litter of their own. Under the circumstances, helping rear
kin is their next best option, better than trying and failing, or challenging the

alpha female and being wounded or driven away.
    Mongoose nursemaids respond to the presence of dominant females by a
downward adjustment of estrogen levels, which temporarily suppresses ovu­
lation. But why not breed anyway, on the off chance that a subordinate can
successfully raise just a small litter? Bonn University's Anne Rasa may have
discovered the answer in a related species of African dwarf mongoose. As in
marmoset monkeys and wild dogs, dominant breeding females ensure the
availability of allomothers by killing such infants as subordinate females have
                          2
the audacity to produce. 3The alpha female makes giving birth an option not
worth the cost. At the same time, the subordinate's prudent postponement of
ovulation means more care available for the alpha female's big litter, to whom
the allomothers arc related as well.
    Contingent Commitment
Clearly, for cooperatively breeding mammals, a female's physical capacity to
conceive and bear viable young is only a small part of the equation. She must
also be able to carry through with the enterprise-rearing offspring to inde­
pendence. Over sixteen years of monitoring a population of black-tailed

prairie dogs, biologist john Hoogland found that the vast majority of mothers
(9 1 percent) arc satisfied that, having committed themselves to gestation and
birth, they have a chance to pull these infants through. The remaining 9 per­
cent of mothers terminate investment at birth and make no effort to keep
pups ali,·e. Unprotected, their young arc eaten by other females in the group,
sometimes with the mother joining in. In other words, the endocrinological
changes that accompany pregnancy and parturition do not, by themselves,
guarantee that a prairie dog mother will behave in what most people think of
as a motherly way.
    These "nonmaternally acting" mothers, as Hoogland called them, weighed
less than the others (though they were not necessarily younger). Hoogland
hypothesized that these females had become pregnant "on spec," gambling on
a hawk carrying off a dominant female or some other improvement in their
fortunes before their due date. But when the small female's time comes, if
her lot has still not improved, the odds arc that a larger mother is going to kill
her offspring. Nearly a quarter of all prairie dog litters are destroyed by other
lactating females . At that point, the mother who gambled and failed gives it
up, sooner rather than later, within the first day or so of birth: better that than
to throw good calories after bad. 24
94                       LOOK      TO THE ANIMALS
    The Real Self-Sacrificing Mother
A survey of the natural world from a life-historical perspective reveals just
how special a creature the self-sacrificing mother envisioned by Gilibert must
be. Such mothers exist. Women do, for example, risk their lives to save their
children. After three marriages, two miscarriages, and the stillbirth of a
daughter, a forty-one-year-old woman learned she was pregnant, and also
that she had leukemia. Treatment could save her, but the medications would
harm the fetus. She opted to postpone treatment. The baby survived. The
mother died soon after giving birth.25
    At issue is not whether some mothers value the survival of one of their
offspring more than their own lives. The question is whether such mothers
evolve as species-typical universals tif thefemale sex. The answer is yes, but under
narrowly defined circumstances. Typically, self-sacrificing mothers arc found
in highly inbred groups, or when mothers are near the end of their reproduc­
tive careers. The forty-one-year-old mother who gives her life for her only
child is not the same individual who decades earlier might well have aborted
her first.
    Mothers as Amalgams of the Past
Pregnancy and motherhood forever change a woman. I do not merely mean
depletion of maternal resources like calcium, a stretching and redistribution
of her tissues, or alterations in her hormone profile. There arc innumerable
small ways. For starters, a fetus-half of whose genetic material comes from
an alien organism-secretes enzymes that block a key component of the
mother's immune response, providing a protected zone in which the embryo
develops and the pregnancy can proceed. Such processes may or may not end
with delivery. Fetal cells have been known to linger on in the mother's body
for as long as twenty-seven years. In some instances, scleroderma, a disease that
involves hardening of the connective tissue, may be triggered by autoimmune
reactions to lingering fetal cells. 26 Beyond changes at the level of cells and tis­
sue, becoming a mother is a turning point in a female's life history, altering
prospects, opportunities, and, especially, a woman's priorities.
    Pregnancy, labor, and delivery alter the brain. They lead to new neural
pathways and the accentuation of certain sensory capacities, such as smell and
hearing. Most research on these transformations has been done on laboratory
animals, but almost certainly similar changes occur in women as well. Many
new mothers feel their baby is so much a part of themselves that seconds

before the infant hegins to whimpet·, needle-like sensations can he felt in the
nipples, and warm, wet milk leaks out. When a new mother says (as I did)
that the birth of bet· first baby transformed her, she is not speaking just
metaphorically.
    A mother's body merges into synchmny with her baby's needs, and the
baby's well-being becomes her pressing concern. Parts of these responses arc
incredibly old. Prolactin, the same hormone that coordinates maternal
responses to infant demands for milk, was already orchestrating metamor­
phoses in amphibians and controlling w ater balance in the tissues of bony
freshwater fish millions of years before any mammal existed (sec chapter 6
for more on the role of this versatile hormone). Every aspect of our neuro­

multiple long-running legacies that we share with earthworms, amphibians,

conditions no longer pertain or have long since disappeared, yet, as we shall

             believed that babies came into this world with essentially blank
             slates waiting to be filled in. We now know that isn't the case. Far
from being a blank slate, or tabula rasa, a human infant, like all apes, is born
with its own agenda, preprogrammed to want to be close to whichever soft,
warm creature cares for it after birth, more than likely its mother. W ith a
repertoire of inborn "fixed action patterns," babies "root" with their lips for a
nipple, suck, grasp, and nestle close, traits that have been crucial for the sur­
vival of primate infants over tens of millions of years. By crying out, signal­
ing, clasping tight, and in emotional terms, by caring desperately, baby
primates do whatever it takes to feel secure. They achieve what John Bowlby
termed the "set-goal of proximity to mother."1
    Innate behavioral systems are activated and reinforced by the same types
of stimuli-touch, sounds, tastes, smells-that primate infants would have
encountered in the past. 2 In the human case, the mother's voice and intona­
tion would be among the stimuli babies are most sensitive to; they are pre­
programmed to learn the language that she speaks, as well as to learn more
readily at cer tain life phases than at others. But the most critical stimulus for
infant development would be the more or less continuous presence of a sym­
pathetic and responsive caretaker.

    Bowlby's "Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedncss"
John Bowlby was the first modern psychologist to follow Darwin's lead,
exploring the implications of humankind's primate heritage for our earliest
desires, fears, needs, and capacities. For more than thi1·ty-five million years,
primate infants stayed safe by remaining close to their mothers day and night.
To lose touch was death. This explains why, even today, separation from a
familiar caretaker provokes first unease, then desperation, followed by rage,
and finally despair.
    An infant safe inside a nursery is still well within his or her rights to feel
distressed at being left alone. Under pressure, and with tough conditioning,
infants learn to cope with the unnatural expectations of modern parents, but
few can he imagined to look forward to spending the night in a dark room
by themselYCs. The sensory and cognitive makeup of modern infants, the
panic they still feel at separation, is distilled from innumerable past lives in
which the infants most likely to survive were those who could prevent sepa­
ration from their mothers. Even children's fantastical fears that something
bad is lurking under the bed are assumed by some psychologists to date from
a time when our ancestors spent nights in trees and predators threatened
from below. 3
    The next time you are so frightened that your skin tingles and the hairs on
your arms stand up , remember that once upon a time, bristling fur made a
threatened mammal seem more formidable. Bowlby's own favorite reminder
of our hirsute birthright was the Umklammerungs-Riflex (or, embrace-reflex)
first described in 1 9 1 8 by German pediatrician E. Moro, who accidentally
jostled a baby he had just delivered. Spontaneously, the newborn's arms flung
out in a symmetrical spasm , and then arced together again in closure. This
same spasmodic startle occurs whenever a baby hears a loud noise or experi­
ences some sudden change in position.
    The Moro reflex causes infants to flap their arms and then clutch inward.
If the infant's hands are already touching something soft, they simply cling
tighter, hopefully to mother; but even a tree limb would he better than
unchecked free fall. If nothing is there to catch on to, a desperate wail
ensues. 4 Of less utility to smooth-skinned humans, the Moro reflex, like
other grasping reflexes of the hands and feet, persists as a relict from past
times, when survival depended on hanging on to a hairy protectress who
might suddenly stand up and push off. 5
                       LOOK      TO   THE    ANIMALS
    In the decades just before and just after World War II, Bowlby was trying
to understand the psychological development of human infants by imagining
the environments in which their emotions evolved. He believed that the basic
survival kit of ape babies would remain the same in infants born to our Pleis­
tocene ancestors.6 Not much was then known about how these early humans
lived, but Bowlby assumed (correctly) that they were nomadic hunters and
gatherers.
    Borrowing the late 1930s concept of"man's ordinary expectable environ­
ment" from a German psychologist, Bowlby recast it into something he could
define "more rigorously in terms of evolution ... [with] a new term that
[will] make explicit that organisms are adapted to particular environments."
Bowlby's new term was "the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness"
(EEA)-the millions of years during which"the behavioral equipment which
is still man's today" would have evolved. 7
    Bowlby understood that the EEA would vary according to exactly which
trait or "system" was being considered, but in the case of the human infant's
emotional attachment to its mother, this Environment of Evolutionary
Adaptedness has changed relatively little over the course of hominoid evolu­
tion. Compared to other behaviors that Bowlby might have focused on (such
as how mothers care for their infants), the infant's powerful desire to be held
close by its caretaker has changed remarkably little over the ten million years
since humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas last shared a common ancestor.
Bowlby's efforts to reconstruct the EEA were bounded on either side by what
he knew about hunter-gatherers' maternal styles, and those of surviving
Great Apes.
    The reason a human infant's attachment to its mother still resembles
an African ape's is that the most immediate environment of evolutionary
relevance for infants was the mother herse!f, not the physical or social world
Pleistocene humans and Pliocene apes inhabited. It was the mother who con­
tinuously carried the infant in skin-to-skin contact-stomach to stomach,
chest to breast. Soothed by her heartbeat, nestled in the heat of her body,
rocked by her movements, the infant's entire world was its mother. It was she
who kept it warm, fed, and safe. Essentially the mother was the infant's
niche, and for those baby apes that survived to breed, the boundaries of that
niche were fairly constan�.

edness has been              enormously        valuable for
explaining infant attac hment to a caretaker.
But by the        1 99 o s, the EEA had become syn­
onymous with a specific period, the Pleis­
tocene. 8 This more narrowly circumscribed
million-and-a-half-year phase in our evolution
was then used by evolutionary psychologists
to explain the totality of human nature, every-
thing from human motivations to enhance inclusive fitness (which humans
share with many other social creatures) to more recent and quite specific
adaptations like language. Some evolutionary psychologists even claim that
we can use contemporary human behaviors (such as our mate preferences) to
reconstruct this ancestral Pleistocene environment.9 It is an ambitious goal,
but it ignores just how much of what humans are, think about, care about,
notice, and feel predates the Pleistocene, as well as giving short shrift to how
much all human social systems depend on local history.
    Expanding the EEA in Both Directions
Body and mind, for better or worse, we passed through the Pleistocene cru­
cible. As is frequently noted, our ancestors lived as hunters and gatherers for
99 percent of the time the genus Homo has been on Earth. This is why I rely so
heavily in this book on evidence from parents who still lived as hunter­
gatherers when they were first studied by anthropologists. Nevertheless,
there are important respects in which a fixation with the Pleistocene is limit­
ing. Many traits that affect infant survival and women's reproductive success
are far older than the Pleistocene, and some are more recent .
    At present, no one knows which types of environment characterized the
tiny population of ten thousand or so anatomically modern humans that
 100                     LOOK     TO    THE   ANIMALS
Mother Nature allowed to pass through the eye of the needle to migrate out
of Africa between )o,ooo and 1 )o,ooo years ago. Most people assume they
were hunters of the African savannas. However, one might just as well guess
that these were the survivors of some ecological perturbation of the time.
Perhaps they were coastal-dwellers depending more on shellfish than big
game, making their way along the water's edge out of Africa. But the point is,
we don't know.
    The twilight of the twentieth century brought with it last-ditch efforts by
anthropologists to chronicle the vanishing lifeways of foragers. Fieldwork by
Richard Lee, Mel Konner, Hillard Kaplan, Kim Hill, Eric Alden Smith, Kris­
ten Hawkes, James O'Connell and others revealed greater variation among
people pursuing this ancient lifestyle than can comfortably be accommodated
in a one-size-fits-all concept like the EEA .
    Given how variable human subsistence styles and family compositions
are-even those of people who still live as foragers-we should not be sur­
prised to learn that their social arrangements are very flexible, even more so
than those of other primates. And some nonhuman primates, especially other
widespread "weedy" and very adaptable species (like savanna baboons or lan­
gur monkeys) are very variable indeed, living in multi-male groups one
place, "harems" in another, aggressive in one locale, peaceful someplace else.
All primates are social. But the only specific social relationship every group
can be said to share is the prolonged relationship between a mother and her
infant during the first years of its life. Even the duration (although not the
intensity) of this universal relationship fluctuates drastically, especially in
humans.10
    There is good reason to suppose that those foraging mothers living in the
most arduous habitats, such as the !Kung San of the Kalahari Desert, gave
birth only after very long, four- to five-year intervals. By the time a toddler
was three years old, he would have been carried by his mother some four
thousand miles. Under the conditions in which these nomadic foragers lived,
infants had to suckle frequently just to keep hydrated as well as nourished.
Even though a few solid foods would have been introduced by six months of
age, survival depended on nursing well into the fourth year. To such an infant,
its mother was cradle, protection, mobility, breakfast, midmorning juice,
lunch, and dinner.
    The ! Kung arc an extreme case. Still, there is little doubt that over the last
million years or so, infants have always striven to remain in continuous con-
     ENVIRONMENTS               OF   EVOLUTIONARY            RELEVANCE 101
tact with their mothers for at least the first few years of life. This was the
infant's first choice, but living up to this "Pleistocene ideal" of mothering may
have been tough for a mother to do-even in the Pleistocene. The human
mother in continuous contact with her infant for four or five years more
nearly represents a primate infant's favored scenario, the scenario most com­
patible with its well-being. But this preferred scenario is not the only one
mothers employed. Wherever reasonably safe alloparental options were
available, human mothers made use of them, as many mothers in foraging
societies in Central Africa and South America still do. Ethnographic evidence
from foraging peoples like the Aka and the Efe, as well as new evidence from
other primates, suggests that alloparents were more important alternatives
to continuous one-on-one contact with the mother than Bowlby had realized.
    In the human case, the extended half-decade of physical closeness between
a mother and her infant so typical of other apes tells us more about the harsh­
ness of local conditions and the mother's lack of safe alternatives than the
"natural state" of all Pleistocene mothers. As Emory University anthropolo­
gist and nutritionist Daniel Sellen joked recently, the only people in the
world who nurse their babies for five years are the !Kung and women anthro­
pologists.
    Rather than turning the EEA into boilerplate for a host of unverifiable
assumptions about the lifestyles of humans in the last several hundred
thousand years, behavioral ecologists recognize that a number of possible
environments might be evolutionarily relevant, depending on which trait is at
issue. Invoking environments of evolutionary relevance is an acknowledg­
ment of accumulated past effects, without necessarily specifying when and
where.
    So let's be clear: humans today are an amalgam of past selection pressures
on ancestors who were mammals, primates, and, most recently, hominids
who lived as foragers in a range of ecological and social settings. Like
baboons, langurs, and other particularly adaptable primates, humans are
found in a broad range of climates, at different altitudes, over a broad array of
habitats. Humans readily adapt to different habitats as other "weedy" species
do; but being culture-bearing, technologically clever primates, they have
even more scope to change their environment to suit their needs.
    True, there are some things we can be quite certain of. Human mothers,
like all members of the family Hominidae, lived in social communities. Off­
spring learned to recognize individuals likely to be kin by using cues provided
 102                    LOOK     TO   THE    ANIMALS
by their mother, particularly by her patterns of association. As they matured,
youngsters learned to discriminate the smell and appearance of close kin and
of their mothers' close associates, and to behave more altruistically toward
them. It is also certain that unlike other Great Apes, women must have lived
in families and relied on other group members to help provision children
who took unusually long to become independent. But beyond these points,
relatively little about these early social environments is certain. We cannot
know for example how long bonds between mates lasted (though one sus­
pects that duration of marriages varied) or what kind of families women lived
in (whose "in-laws," for example, they lived nearest to).
    One on one, there is little doubt that a man would almost always be able
to dominate his mate, as is true for virtually all simian primates. But beyond
that, men's ability to control where women in their group went and what
they did would have varied a great deal, depending on who else was there to
back the women up . Who else was there would depend on local subsistence
patterns and history, for apart from a universal tendency for primate females
to avoid mating with close kin, women exhibit no clear and consistent predis­
positions either to leave or to remain near kin.
    People who live by foraging may move daily, or almost never. They live in
desolate terrain at population densities lower than one person per 250 square
kilometers, in groups that rarely meet and defend no territories, or in
densely occupied habitats with one person per square kilometer. Hunters can
contribute anywhere from 1 oo percent of daily calories (as among the Eski­
mos) to 2o percent, with the remainder being made up by tubers, nuts,
seeds, and other foods gathered by women. When people rely on shellfish or
                                              11
hunt with nets, both sexes often participate.
    Large maternal contributions to subsistence would have meant that moth­
ers had more freedom to come and go, with important implications for
whether females stayed among kin or left home at marriage, all critical, as we
shall sec, for how much autonomy a woman retains over reproductive deci­
sions, how free she is to choose when and with whom she will mate. Female
autonomy depends on the availability of support from her kin. This is true for
all well-studied primates as well as most human societies in which one sex is
more likely to move at marriage. When mothers remain among kin, they
retain more autonomy than when they travel far from their natal place to live
among their mate's kin.12

Evolutionarily, humans arc a "mixed bag." A line from an old nursery rhyme,

boys but for everybody. A thrifty matron and inveterate recycler, Mother
Nature is slow to discard leftm·ers. Conservative retention of useful mole­

   Just for fun, imagine that all human traits really did evolve in the Pleis­
tocene. What might a made-to-order Pleistocene baby be like? This ideally
designed baby would fit the bill for any mother who works nine to five, but he
or she would resemble no human baby ever born. Adapted for twice-daily
feedings, morning and night, this PPB ("Perfect Pleistocene Baby") would be
capable of digesting high-protein , high-fat milk, just like baby tree shrews and
other mammal infants whose mothers leave them in nests for hours on end.
Mothers would produce this rich fare and then trot off every morning with
their digging sticks (or briefcases), leaving behind babies that required almost
no one-on-one attention. Whichever individuals had gone out foraging or
hunting the day before would take a turn resting at camp, protecting the
nursery till the foragers returned.
   Because learning would be postponed, the Perfect Pleistocene Baby
would spend its day in a frozen or hypnotic state, curious about nothing,
emotionally uninvoh·ed, conserving energy, never crying or calling attention
to itself, and requiring little in the way of monitoring. In the evening, when
the mother returned, she would take the baby to a defecation site some dis­
tance from camp, so that all excretions could take place before returning to
settle down for a good feed and a restful night. With this carefully engineered
suite of adaptations, mothers could forage more efficiently, bring back more
provemler, breed much faster.
    Of course it never happened that way. And if it had, the end product would
 104                    LOOK       TO THE ANIMALS
not be human. As Bowlby realized, the reason foraging mothers never pro­
duced such accommodating youngsters is that our species evolved as primates,
already committed to mothers who produce dilute low-fat, low-protein milk,
and to babies who suckle semicontinuously throughout the day and night.
     Every living organism, every organ of every organism, not to mention tis­
sues and molecules, whether or not they arc still in use, bears the accumu­
lated imprints of multiple past lives. Never permitted the luxury of starting
from scratch to produce the perfect solution, natural selection recycles
workable solutions for a "good-enough" fit, meaning simply: better than the
competition.
    Consider melatonin, a hormone the body relies upon to regulate internal
clocks. Melatonin has become fashionably known as the "miracle hormone"
among jet-setters, who take it in pill form just before bedtime in a new time
zone to convince their body that it really is nighttime. Scientists are more
likely to dub melatonin the "Dracula hormone" because its production is
stimulated by darkness and inhibited by bright light.
    An ancient, pre-Pleistocene compound, melatonin is found in the skin of
amphibians. In humans it is produced by the pineal gland, a pea-sized organ
once mistakenly assumed to be a functionless vestige. Far from it. One of the
pineal gland's products, this venerable light-sensitive secretion plays a key (if
sti11 poorly understood) role in regulating body rhythms. Melatonin levels
rise at night during the hours most primates sleep and fall during the day,
permitting a pregnant mother to chemically communicate information about
day length to her fetus. 14
    We primates are, by and large, diurnal beings, adapted for daylight (a fact
that makes night shifts particularly dangerous and subject to accidents).
Instead of bungling about in the dark, risking an encounter with predators
like leopards, who see better in dim light than we do, primates spend nights
safely up trees, high on cliffs, in arboreal nests (like chimps), or swinging gen­
tly in a hammock by the fire. We do not just sleep, perchance to dream, but so
as to not to be eaten.
    Ape bodies take advantage of a mother's enforced respite to do their
endocrinological equivalent of paperwork. The frequency of an infant's night­
time suckling serves the mother's body as an index of how much milk the
baby is consuming. Complex feedback loops then act like a master control,
regulating how long the mother should delay before ovulating again and con­
ceiving her next baby (explained below, in chapter 8). Nighttime feedings
      ENVIRONMENTS            OF EVOLUTIONARY              RELEVANCE 105
turn out to be the key ledget· entry for a mother's reproductive budgeting.
Surges in plasma prolactin levels produced in response to her baby's sucking
arc four to six times greater between the hours of midnight and four A.M.
(when melatonin lc\"cls arc highest) than when a mother nurses during day­
time. For this reason, three or four breast-feeds during the night may have
greater impact on delaying the next pregnancy than six daytime feeds. 15
    The next time you hear a nursing mother who unexpectedly finds herself
pregnant grumble that breast-feeding did not suppress her ovulation, remind
her of her primate past and all the ancient evenings her ancestors spent up in
trees. In her eagerness to get a good night's rest, she probably overlooked the
importance of breast-feeding during the night. She forgot, or more probably
ne\"er considered, that for seventy million years, as mothers dozed on and off
till dawn, infants whiled away those sunless hours by alternating between
right nipple and left. As they suckled, they triggered the release of ancient
compounds dating from amphibian, mammalian, and primate past lives that
delay the next conception.
    Every detail of our bodies has its history, and many of them have conse­
quences. Accustomed to the beat of the mother's heart in utero, the infant
prefers left nipple to right. Not surprisingly, today 83 percent of right­
handed women, and 78 percent of left-handed mothers, still cradle their baby
on the same side as their heart. Presumably, this explains why most Renais­
sance Madonnas are depicted holding babies on the left side, and why one ear
is better at recognizing music and the melodic aspects of language than the
           16
other ear.
     From fretting babies to unplanned pregnancies, these examples suggest
that unless acknowledged and understood, ancient legacies can prove incon­
venient to our efforts to chart the future. But natural selection didn't stop
dead in its tracks when the Pleistocene ended. We are kidding ourselves if we
think so. A mother today, whether in NewYork,Tokyo, or Dacca , is not just a
gatherer caught in a shopping mall without her digging stick. We arc subtly
and not so subtly different from our Pleistocene ancestors in ways that have
been transmitted genetically as well as through multiple parental effects
between generations.
     Evolution Since the Pleistocene
There is a widespread assumption that evolution only occurs very slowly,
over vast geological time spans. By and large this is true. But too many ex-
 I06                       LOOK        TO THE ANIMALS
ceptions to this r ule have been documented, both in lab and field, to allow
anyone to take for granted that the pace of evolution is necessari ly slow.
Genetically produced life-history changes in mother fish can be documented
after only forty generations in a new environment, with mothers evolving to
produce bigger babies after longer intervals when predation pressures are
reduced.17
    Humans are unusual in this respect. Cultures can change much faster than
bodies evolve. This puts humans in a special category, but it does not place us
outside the reach of evolutionary change. We are at once relicts of Pleis­
tocene foragers and altered specimens. Many people descend from ancestors
lucky enough to have survived past epidemics of common post-Neolithic dis­
cases like plague and cholera because they possessed versions of genes that
conferred some degree of protection against these diseases.18 Some are
unlucky enough to have genes that interact with our new environment to
produce nearsightedness or diabetes. W henever humans find themselves liv­
ing under novel conditions, there are new opportunities for selection to act.
An example would be ongoing selection for heavier birth weights in babies
whose mothers have recently migrated to higher elevations of the Himalayas
ofKashmir.19
    For most of us alive today, the environments of our ancestors underwent
massive changes in the recent past. Almost no one you know traces his or her
ancestry directly to hunters and gatherers. Rather, the vast majority of us are
descended from peasants. Many were born to mothers who kept their babies
in cradles or swaddled them, leaving babies with a kinsvvoman or other tem­
porary caretaker while they engaged in seasonal work, planting or har vesting.
These more recent legacies also leave their traces.
    In mammals, natural selection will almost always have its greatest impact
on the vulnerable life phases: in utero, during infancy, and just post-weaning.
Assuming twenty-five years per generation, there have been about four hun­
dred generations from the start of the Neolithic* until now. This represents
four hundred opportunities for natural selection to act. A selective differen­
tial of just 2 percent can boost a gene from rarity to near fixation (that is,
from a genetic frequency of less than 2 percent to more than 98 percent) in
ten thousand years or less. Theoretically, changes in humankind's biological

and social environments since the Neolithic should be reflected in the
                                             20
genome of modern humans, and many arc.
    Not surprisingly, the best documented cases have to do with disease, diet,
and infant mortality-three areas where the Neolithic would be expected to
expose humans to novel selection pressures. The end of the Pleistocene and
the dawn of agriculture brought new types and greater abundance of food, as
well as settled living, increased population, more sewage and water pollu­
tion, and the compression of people into smaller areas. Crowded conditions
presented many new opportunities for water- and mosquito-borne diseases
to infect people. Dense populations with open sewers allowed typhoid,
cholera, and other gastrointestinal diseases to spread quickly through a popu­
lation. Irrigation ditches brought mosquito-transmitted diseases to drier
parts of the world where such infections had previously been rare. Respira­
tory diseases like tuberculosis spread from person to person in populations
large enough and crowded enough to supply the pathogens with host after
host. Several old diseases previously confined to other mammals, such as
bubonic plague and AIDS, found new opportunities to jump across species
boundaries and infect human hosts.
    As a consequence of heavy selection pressure from these diseases, any
genetic trait that conferred resistance to them was selected for-even against
strong counterselective pressures. For example, 4 to !) percent of people of
European descent have a single copy of a gene that causes cystic fibrosis when
inherited from both parents. In these populations, about one in 2,!)oo babies
will be born with this lethal double dose and will develop the disease, which
(until medical treatments became available) killed by age two.
    Normally such lethal genes would have long since been selected out of the
human population. Yet cystic fibrosis has been around for at least !)O,ooo
years, and, according to microbiologist Gerald Pier at Harvard Medical
School, there is a reason. In its single form, the cystic fibrosis gene protects
people against typhoid fever, just as in the better-known case of the sickle­
cell gene, which protects its possessor against malaria. When inherited from
both mother and father, the bearer suffers from sickle-cell anemia.
    Rapid selection could also be going on currently with respect to AIDS.
There are areas in Africa today where as many as 2!) percent of women of
childbearing age are HIV-positive. Such HIV-positive women are thought to
have a reduced chance of becoming pregnant. 21 There is also a decline in the
survival chances of their offspring. Such babies are exposed to maternally
 1 08                    LOOK      TO  THE    ANIMALS
transmitted infection either from mother's blood during birth or from
mother's milk afterward. Even if babies escape infection, they are likely to be
orphaned at a young age. Yet there are already hints that some African women
are resistant to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS.
We would expect any genetic resistance to be disproportionately represented
among the survivors. As selection works against those who are infected, it
will favor the AIDS-resistant mothers and offspring.
                                                       22
     A surprising amount of epidemiological history can be read into the genes
of surviving human populations. Genes can also tell us something about what
foods people were adapted to eat. Consider the genes for lactose tolerance.
     All baby mammals are born with the digestive equipment to synthesize
the enzyme lactase. T his enzyme enables them to break down and digest lac­
tose, the carbohydrates in milk. Among many humans around the world the
ability to digest milk sugars does not persist into adulthood. After all, being
able to digest milk would be completely useless to adult foragers, who do
not herd animals. Individuals who lack the appropriate enzyme to drink
unprocessed milk may suffer from gas or diarrhea. T his is why Western aid,
which typically included powdered milk, got such a bad name in large areas
of sub-Saharan Africa in the 1 97os. Instead of helping, the donated milk pow­
der made people sick.
    Today, the main explanation for why so much diversity in milk tolerance
exists is that since the end of the Pleistocene, some human populations began
herding cows and consuming dairy products; others did not. In another
example of rapid evolution, just in the last ten thousand years, the genes that
promote lactase synthesis past infancy spread in populations where milk was
fed long past weaning, and were lost where it was not. Fewer than 2 percent
of adults in a population with a horticultural history, such as the Bantu of
Central Africa, test positive for lactose digestion, and no !Kung do. By con­
trast, 90 to 1 oo percent ofTutsi populations in Rwanda and the Congo-all
descended from milk-dependent pastoralists-retain the capacity to digest
milk sugars throughout their lives. 23
     Some legacies from our hominid past may be adaptive in our new
crowded, high-speed, high-tech, twenty-four-hour-a-day environments. We
arc, indeed, highly adaptable creatures who adjust quickly to new habitats,
acquire new tastes, and learn new tasks-especially when young. Yet other
traits, such as our lust for fats and sweets (left over from a time when it was
impossible to get too much of either), can be extremely maladaptive when
     E N VI R 0 N M E N T S    0 F  E V0 L U T I 0 NA R Y  R E L E VA N C E  I 09
they lead to obesity and clogged arteries. 24 For mothers and infants, the
biggest clash between ancient predispositions and modern lifestyle is the
physical separation required by modern workplaces. Mothers find it stressful
to go off to work and leave their infants behind. Babies find it even more so.
    Balancing Motherhood and Work
\Vorking mothers arc not new. For most of human existence, and for millions
of years before that, primate mothers have combined productive lives with
reproduction. This combination of work with motherhood has always
entailed tradeoffs. Mothers either sustained energetic costs and lost effi­
ciency by toting babies everywhere (the way baboons and !Kung mothers do)
or else located an alloparent to take on the task. W hat is new for modern
mothers, though, is the compartmentalization of their productive and repro­
ducth·e lives. The factories, laboratories, and offices where women in post­
industrial societies go to "forage" are even less compatible with childcare than
jaguar-infested forests and distant groves of mongongo nuts reached by
trekking across desert.
    The economic reality of most people's lives today is that families require
more than one wage-earner-or forager. Single parents are especially hard­
pressed to make ends meet. Only brief periods of prosperity or isolated blips
of elite privilege have made this untrue for some people during a few periods
in human existence. An expansion of the U.S. economy after World War II,
for example, meant that many married women could afford to stay home
with their babies. But no more. Most mothers, even if they want to, do not
have the option of staying home to care for their babies.
    And that's the modern rub. During the Pleistocene, women could carry
their babies as they foraged or gathered firewood. Dual-career mothers still
strive to balance their subsistence needs against the time, energy, and
resources needed to rear their children. But the physical (if not always the
emotional) environment in which these compromises must be made is con­
siderably different from the workplace of our ancestors. In some respects,
omnipresent conflicts create even more tension today than in the past,
because the incentives to fix them strike mothers as optional. Outcomes are
measured in terms of the personal toll-insecurities among infants, stress in
their mothers-rather than increased mortality. Simply put, the pressures to
change are less intense when children can (literally) live with the conse­
quences.
 I IO                      LOOK    TO   THE    ANIMALS
     If infants feel stressed by the separation, so do millions of working moth­
ers. At the same time, the evolutionarily novel modern workaday world
opened the door for untrammeled expression of another ancient female
motivation-striving for status, or, in the case of a forager, what one might
think of as "local clout."
     Maternity and Ambition
It is widely assumed that competitiveness, status-striving, and ambition,
qua1ities that are essential for success in demanding careers, are incompatible
with being a "good mother," who is expected to be selfless and nurturing.
"There is no getting around the fact that ambition is not a maternal trait.
Motherhood and ambition arc still largely seen as opposing forces," states
Shari Thurer, a prominent contemporary psychologist. Sociologists can doc­
ument at length the "cultural contradictions" produced by women combining
motherhood with jobs in the American workplace. 25
     Under conditions of the modern world, and if we assume the old defini­
tion of mothering as an innately charitable and selfless pursuit, the point is
well taken. But as I described in chapter 2, mothering in the natural world is
different from the Victorian image of mothers. Mothers' work has not always
been so compartmentalized from child-rearing as it is today, nor her status so
separate from the prospects that a mother's offspring would survive and
prosper.
     Modern women may think of status as the icing on their economic cake.
But once the significance of social rank is understood for such vital functions
as a mother keeping another female from eating her baby (as in the case of
chimps), or for keeping another female from monopolizing resources needed
by her own offspring (as in the case of other cooperatively breeding mam­
mals), the struggle for status seems more nearly a foothold on posterity than
a frill. "Ambition" was an integral part of producing offspring who survived
and prospered.
     Estab1ishing an advantageous niche for herself was how Flo, the chim­
panzee female that Jane Goodall studied for so many years, stay ed fed, guar­
anteed access to food for her offspring, and kept them safe from interference
by other mothers. Eventually Flo's high status made it possible for her daugh­
ter Fifi to be among the few females who would remain in hei· natal place to
breed-in Fifi's case, inheriting her mother's territory. Even more impres­
sive data documenting the connection between f'cmalc status and all sorts of
       ENVIRONMENTS            OF  EVOLUTIONARY           RELEVANCE Ill
rcproductiYe parameters-age of menarche, infant-sur vival rates, and even
sex ratios of offspring-have been compiled for Old World cercopithecine
monkeys like macaques and baboons. These data strongly suggest that gener­
alized strh·ing for local clout was genetically programmed into the psyches of
female primates during a distant past when status and motherhood were
                     26
totally conYergent.
    E,·idence for human primates is less clear, in part because husbands fig­
ure so prominently in the social status of most mothers. Yet both fiction
and ethnography provide multiple examples. For example, Nisa, the !Kung
woman, tells what happened when her first husband, Tashay, brought home a
second wife. "I chased her away and she went back to her parents," Nisa says
simply. Nisa's own mother had done the same thing a generation before. The
children of this new wife would have competed with Nisa's for food provided
by her husband and other community members. Nisa acted so as to maintain
her status as her husband's only, primary wife. Her actions were in keeping
with being a "good mother." Such women do not compete for status and rep­
utation in the spheres that matter to men (for example, being known as a
great hunter or warrior); they compete in the spheres that actually matter to
mothers.27
    Occasionally, we can detect bizarre manifestations of these old connec­
tions, as in the case of the Texas mother who hired a hit-man to murder the
mother of her daughter's cheerleading rival in order to derail her emotion­
ally. 28 But for the most part, status-striving by mothers seeking to enhance
the prospects of their children is more subtle. Think of the womanly rivalries
chronicled for early-nineteenth-century England by Jane Austen, or by Edith
W harton for the early-twentieth-century tribal life of "Old New York." In
subtle, private, and scarcely perceptible ways, both mothers and their rela­
tions close ranks so as to promote and protect the marriage opportunities
(which in that world meant access to resources) of young kinswomen, while
locking out other young women. We tend to think of these mothers as "con­
trolling," "pushy," "interfering"-and I don't disagree-but the venerable
ancestry of such traits is worth considering. In their environments of evolu­
tionary relevance, these women would have been behaving like successful
mothers.
    Far from "opposing forces," maternity and ambition are inseparably
linked. The circumstances of modern life tend, however, to obscure the con­
nection. This is because jobs, status, and resource defense occur in separate
 I I 2                    LOOK     TO   THE   ANIMALS
domains from child-rearing. At the same time, civilized mores and laws mean
that mothers do not have to rely on intimidation to drive off rival mothers
and keep their offspring safe from competing interests. Most mothers read­
ing this book worry far less about famine, tigers, and infanticidal conspecifics
than they worry over job promotions, health benefits, and finding adequate
day care.
      For the most part, mothers striving for status in the modern workplace do
so outside the home. Often working mothers are driven to pursue status
interests for long hours, far from home, in ways just as likely to harm as to
help their baby cope with life. The conflict, however, is not between mater­
nity and ambition, but between the needs of infants and the way a woman's
ambition plays out in modern workplaces. 29
     In the modern world, status (whether socioeconomic or professional) is,
if any thing, in,erselj' correlated with reproductive success. This is especially
true for women who earn their status. Not long ago, sociobiologist Susan
Essock-Vitale looked at the reproductive success of people listed on Forbes
            '
Maaazine s annual listing of the four hundred wealthiest Americans. Those
women who had inherited wealth had significantly more children on average
than successful businesswomen who had acquired their wealth through their
own efforts. This should not come as a surprise. W hen given the opportunity,
many women value upward mobility over time devoted to rearing a family.
We need only look at the grueling hours that working mothers put into jobs
as lawyers, doctors, and research scientists, careers with demands as insa­
tiable as those of children. But if our evolutionary heritage has any relevance
to what we are, how can this be?
     The answer is simple. In worlds where there was no birth control, and
where no female was ever celibate, there was no possibility that female rank
and maternal reproductive success could be other than correlated. Nature
built in no safeguards to ambition run awry, as it were, to energies diverted to
status ends that were not linked to the production, survival, and prosperity of
offspring. Now that status and the survival of offspring have been decoupled,
will there be selection against women who are especially inclined or driven
to achieve? Probably, if our species survives long enough, and if circum­
stances in the workplace don't change.
     Torn between two ancient, pressing, and now incompatible urges, women
arc forced to make new tradeoffs. Forging workable compromises between
infant needs and maternal ambition requires considerable ingenuity, self-
      ENVIRONMENTS              OF   EVOLUTIONARY           RELEVANCE 113
understanding, and common sense. This is especially true in highly competi­
th·e and demanding fields. Science provides the case studies with which I am
most familiar.
    Novel Compromises
In I 976, the year after I completed my Ph.D., an article appeared titled "The
high price of success in science," written by a young molecular biologist,
Nancy Hopkins, who would go on to become a leader in her field. She argued
that it was not possible for a woman in such a competitive profession­
demanding, in her case, a minimum of seventy hours a week in the lab-to
"be a successful wife and mother as well as a successful scientist." Her words
were sobering and, looking back on that era of what Hopkins called "the
bionic woman hard sell of the '7os," unusually honest. About the time Hop­
kins wrote that article, there were ten tenured women professors at Harvard
Medical School; nine of the ten had no children.
    Yet there were women who managed to successfully combine science
with motherhood. None I know took ordinary routes. Mary Jane West­
Eberhard, for example, whose ideas about the role of development in evolu­
tionary processes I discussed in chapter 3, is legendary among women field
biologists for the way she managed to combine her family and professional
lives. "It's what we all do," she told me once, apropos of the extra-tough com­
promises field biology requires of mothers. "We each construct our own idio­
syncratic life." In West-Eberhard's case, she opted to forgo a conventional
teaching position at a major university to take a research job. The position
allowed the Eberhards to live in Central America, where they could afford
housekeeping help, and, more importantly, where they could do research
while keeping an eye on their three children-literally, since the wasps they
studied were on the roof of their house.
    My own compromises took me in the opposite direction. I switched from
tramping around forested hillsides, following monkeys in India, to doing
research on human parents in archives in the United States, where I used
part-time daycare, and along with my husband took full advantage of emerg­
ing opportunities to work less than full-time and to use fax machines, and
eventually the Internet, to work at home. W hen my third child was born, I
hired a generous-hearted allomother on a very long-term basis. She lives
with us still, though my youngest child is twelve, and the allomother now
pursues a part-time profession of her own.
 114                     LOOK    TO THE ANIMALS
    Pretty obviously, not one of us was living the same way as our ancestors.
Yet we were required to resolve similar dilemmas, and so we forged new
solutions for doing so-a theme that recurs throughout this book.
    Why the Past Matters
Many of us at different stages of our lives desperately desire a child. Others,
out of commitment to career or for other reasons, are determined to have
none. Many women are certain they will never want a child, and then change
their mind. Still others have babies by accident. Those who consciously
decide are often making pragmatic decisions with a watchful ey e on the
effects upon their career, existing children, or the overall well-being of their
family. Few people give much thought to the evolutionary origins of the emo­
tions that inform such conscious or unconscious "decisions." But I am con­
vinced we are more tightly linked to our past than most people imagine.
    W hether we think about it or act "on impulse," each of us constantly
makes myriad small decisions on a daily basis that in ancestral environments
would have been correlated with reproductive success. Like it or not, each of
us lives with the emotional legacy and decision-making equipment of moth­
ers who acted so as to ensure that at least one <jJsprin9 survived to reproduce.
Prudent allocation of reproductive effort and the construction of an advanta­
geous social niche in which her offspring could survive and prosper were
linked to ultimate reproductive success.
    Women-and men-today have an unprecedented range of choices. So
far environments and the availability of birth control make it possible to have
a few children, be confident that they will survive, and invest heavily in each
one. Yet certain constraints are more or less immutable. For example,
although women in postindustrial societies live longer and experience
menopause later than was true for most of our foraging ancestors, the outer
limits arc still fixed. Few women conceive past fifty. Any woman who waits
until forty to bear her first child is taking a chance that she will never con­
ceive one.
    Because we are primates, adoption and the rearing of genetically unre­
lated babies come easily. Unlike herd-dwelling ungulates, we do not have a
critical period minutes after birth when a mother must imprint on her baby's
smell and bond with it then or never. If we were sheep, we would not have to
worry about babies getting mixed up, switched at birth in maternity wards.

116                      LOOK     TO   THE    ANIMALS
But we are primates, and primate females in the right frame of mind find all
babies fascinating and attractive. For such females, the most important ingre­
dient for eliciting love is not the molecules producing a particular scent, or
genetic relatedness, but physical proximity over time. W hether a new mother
will be willing and able to keep her baby close long enough for this old pri­
mate magic to work depends on her psychological state, as well as her physi­
cal and social circumstances.
    Human mothers learn to recognize their own babies in the days right after
birth, and gradually "fall in love." Since babies return the favor, the baby's
attachment to the mother further reinforces her commitment. This is why
when babies are adopted, the younger the better. But just as surely as the
forty- to fifty-year lifespan of a standard-issue ape ovary is fixed and more or
less immutable, fixed also are the developmental needs of infants. The same
processes by which babies attach to and learn to love their caretakers impose
a tremendous cost when such attachments never form, or when sequential
attachments are ruptured. Below a certain level of nurturing, the develop­
mental outcome is disastrous. If a baby docs not perceive that he or she is
growing up among committed kin, even a measure of care considered ade­
quate for development within normal limits may not be enough to produce
an adult who realizes his or her full human potential of empathy for others.
    By itself, giving birth does not guarantee that a mother will care for every
baby she bears. A woman predisposed to be a mother can learn to love any
baby, while a mother not so disposed does not even learn to love her own.
This is what it means to live with the emotional legacy of a human who
evolved in a hominid context where mothers relied on assistance from others
to help rear offspring.
    We are a clever and highly innovative species, but not infinitely so. Our
past matters, not just on the physical, but on an emotional front. Docs this
mean we have no conscious choice over how we lead our lives? Not at all.
People exercise free will all the time-but only in those areas where Mother
Nature cut them some slack. A woman can choose which baby she will adopt,
but falling in love with that child will not be automatic. Nor can a woman just
will herself to love a child, or respond to legal prescriptions that she do so.
This is one reason why a certain number of children placed in foster homes or
adopted end up being n�turncd-a painful outcome for all concerned that
few adoptive parents wish to discuss. This book will make clear why efforts to

    Many biological constraints-especially those having to do with disease,
and with increasing or decreasing fertility-have been removed by medical
innovations. Today, we have more options than humans have ever had before.
But such options only crop up in the interstices we carved for ourselves with
new technologies. Yet these new technologies, as often as not, bring with
them new constraints. Consider just one. It takes longer, and requires more
investment from parents than ever before, for children to acquire the educa­
tion they need to negotiate effectively in an increasingly complex world.
Such costs in turn alter emotional equations in the lives of parents, rendering
some less willing to have children.
    By placing human mothers and infants in a broader comparative and evo­
lutionary framework, I offer a new slant on what babies need from their
mothers, what mothers need from others in order to provide it, and explain
why. Explanations do little to solve such practical problems as how to enlist
more infant care from fathers and alloparents. I offer no plan for safe and
affordable day care. But I at least provide rough outlines for what adequate
allomaternal care has to include, and why it would be worth any community's
while to make such care a priority . Knowing more about the processes and
history-both deep and more recent-that underlie maternal emotions and
infant needs has to be the first step in meeting them.

     s sex destiny?" When this question is posed, it's a safe bet that the under­
     lying agenda has to do with what women should be doing. Should they be
     home caring for their children or off pursuing other interests? A compar­
ative look at other creatures that (like humans) breed cooperatively and share
responsibilities for rearing young with other group members reveals that sex
per se is not the issue. Lactation is.
    Caretakers of both sexes, wet-nurses, even "daycare"-none of these are
uniquely human, nor particularly new. They are standard features of many
cooperatiYely hreeding species. As we saw, cooperative breeding is exquis­
itely well developed in insects such as honeybees and wasps. Shared provi­
sioning is also common among birds such as acorn woodpeckers, bee-eaters,
dunnocks, and scrub jays. Although cooperative breeding is uncommon
among mammals generally, it is richly developed in species such as wolves,
wild dogs, dwarf mongooses, elephants, tamarins, marmosets, and humans.
In all these animals, individuals other than the mother ("allomothers") help
her proYision or otherwise care for her young. Typically, allomothers will
include the mother's mate (often but not necessarily the genetic progenitor).
Indh·iduals other than either parent ("alloparents") also help. These helpers
are most often recruited from kin who are not yet ready to reproduce them­
selves, or from subordinates who do not currently-or may never have­
better options. In the human case, the most important alloparents are often
older, post-reproductive relatives who have already reproduced.
    Among mammals, the trend toward having young who require costly
long-term care began modestly enough. It probably began with an egg-laying
brooding reptile that started to secrete something milklike. Such egg-layers
gradually developed glands especially equipped for milk production. Only
among mammals did one sex come to specialize in manufacturing custom­
made baby formula, to provide something critical for infant survival that

                                 mate mothers, instead of bearing litters, began
                                 focusing care on one baby at a time. These sin­
                                 gletons were born mature enough to cling to
                                 their mother's fur, to be carried by her right
                                 from birth and for months thereafter. Whether
or not this intimate and prolonged association is the mother's destiny, sex is
not the issue. Lactation is.
     What Is Lactation About?
Other forms of caretaking-fathers brooding eggs, bringing food, protecting
babies-are not nearly so sex-specific. Even gestation is a function that in
rare cases (for example, the sea horse) a male takes on. But not lactation.
Why -with the sole exception of one rare fruit bat-does lactation appear
to be exclusively female? How did these curious secretions get started?
     At first glance, a mother sea horse might seem to have a sweet deal. She
sallies up to her mate, injects her eggs into his belly pouch, and then, care­
free, propels herself off to feed and make more eggs. Meanwhile, back at the
male's pouch, the sea-mare's last batch is fertilized, toted, and kept safe in the
ballooning brood c hamber of the now extremely pregnant male. At birth, as
many as 1 ,soo fully formed but still minuscule and defenseless sea-foals are
sprayed out into the open ocean. The sea around them teems with predators
and competitors, many bigger than they are. Forced to fend for themselves
immediately after birth, almost all starve.
      Viviparity means keeping infants safe inside some scaled chamber within
the parent's body till they can be born alive, as opposed to protected in an egg
till hatching. But by itself, viviparity offers tiny, still helpless creatures only

Fig. 6. 2 Parental care is rare in reptiles. But there are exceptions, such as maternal protection of
young by mother crocodiles, or the reconstructed behavior of this duck-billed dinosaur affec­
tionately named Maiasaura, "the good mother reptile." Her nest contained ten to twenty altricial
eggs which hatched so early and so helpless that family members were required to provision
them. (Drawmg by Marianne Collins; reproduced wi1h permissionfrom Random House, London)
the slimmest toehold on posterity. Why not linger in the womb longer, and
grow bigger before venturing into the world?
    The parent so encumbered becomes less efficient at foraging, eats less
well, is less able to evade predators. Lactation evolved because it beat avail­
able alternatives for fueling rapid growth in warm-blooded babies while
allowing a foraging mother to safely stash immatures who will be somewhat
safer in a nest or burrow than if they must fend for themselves.
     Merits ofLactation
The currently favored hy pothesis for why dinosaurs disappeared is that global
climate fluctuations led to mass star vation among immatures. Mammals pur­
suing "the milky way" had an obvious advantage. Maternal provisioning
through lactation spares immatures the hazards of foraging and competing
with more mature animals to stay fed.
     Being able to rely on the maternal larder long after birth buffers imma­
tures from local scarcity. Remaining with a lactating mother provides a stable
and viable environment for immatures who would otherwise be unable to
survive severe climate fluctuations. As the dinosaurs died out, lactators came
into their own.
 124               MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
    Mammalian mothers were alchemists, able to transform available fod­
der-shellfish, grass, insects, other mammals, even toxic plants-into bio­
logical white gold: a blend of highly digestible nutrients and antibiotics that
fuels and protects immatures during the hazardous days just after birth. A
mother stockpiles energy, protein, and minerals as fat deposits on her body
and doles out these repackaged nutrients on a mutually beneficial, often quite
flexible, schedule.
    Like the young of a cold-blooded reptile, the young of a mother bear enter
the world just a fraction of their mother's bulk. But thereafter baby reptile
and baby mammal grow differently. Take the American black bear. During the
abundance of summer, the mother mates. Copulating induces her to ovulate,
but the fertilized ova do not immediately implant. They enter a state of sus­
pended development. As winter approaches, the mother grows drowsy and
retreats to her cave to save body fuel by hibernating for the winter. Even then,
continuing her pregnancy is not automatic.
    If the bear has managed to store up enough fat to sustain lactation, the fer­
tilized eggs (or blastocysts) implant, gestation and birth ensue, and the
mother sleepily suckles her babies till spring. Not enough fat, and the earliest
abortion nature offers takes place: implantation never occurs. The next con­
ception is postponed pending improvement in the mother's circumstances.
    If there is enough fat on board to sustain lactation, implantation proceeds
and the mother gives birth to two to four cubs. After birth, cubs have months
to grow before their mother brings them out in the open, and years more
before they must forage on their own. If just one is born, the mother occa­
sionally abandons it rather than allow a singleton to monopolize such a long
interval between births. That way she gives birth sooner to the full comple­
ment of which she is capable.
    By the time the three-year-old bears launch out on their own, they are
respectably burly versions of their mother, able to eat what she cats and at
least to threaten whomever she scares off . By contrast, at independence, their
reptile counterparts are but twinkles in the eyes of competitors and preda­
tors alike. 1
    Even without such gimmicks as hibernation or delayed implantation, flex­
ible lactation schedules permit mammals that originated in the tropics to
adapt to freezing climes. Macaques in northern Japan give birth and spend
the summer feeding and suckling their new babies. As fall approaches, the
young arc weaned. Both mother and weanling forage furiously to lay down fat

other fare is buried under a blanket of
snow, and the monkeys must subsist on
tree bark far too formidable for immature
teeth to gnaw. At this nadir in food avail­
ability, months after their young were
first weaned, mothers miraculously re­
sume lactation. 2
      Storing Fat
It is advantageous for mother mammals to be able to stockpile fat in advance,
on layaway, to be drawn upon later as needed. Still, timing remains crucial.
Fat is stored out of the way in tails, buttocks, or humps on the body, where
mobility will not be impeded. Deposition is under tight physiological con­
trol, and often-as in the case of the Japanese macaques-postponed as long
as possible.
      Consider our own species. With sufficient fat on board, some fat cells start
to secrete a hormone called leptin , which triggers endocrinological transfor­
mations leading to menarche. Some time after that, a young woman actually
becomes fertile. By then she will have laid down sufficient fat to help carry
her through pregnancy and lactation, what some anthropologists term
"reproductive fat."3 A woman's reproductive fat is concentrated in the but­
tocks and upper thighs, or around the abdomen. Inadvertently, modern
women relive these golden years of fat deposition when they take synthetic
estrogen-a reproductive hormone-after menopause.
      No comparable fat deposition occurs in men. Prior' to puberty, little boys
and little girls have equivalent layers of fat. In the two years after menarche,
however, the proportion of fat on a girl's body increases by 2 14 percent, in
preparation for reproduction."' Recognizing this, many societies give pubes­
cent girls special foods and lessen their workloads. In many areas of village

                                      generating hypotheses to explain the spe­

                                      lescent girl's mammary glands. These
range from the idea that breasts, like buttocks or a camel's hump, are a conve­
nient place to store fat, to the proposal that large breasts helped hominid ado­
lescents compete with other females for a good husband by advertising
(either "deceptively" or "honestly") that she has stockpiled sufficient fat to
sustain lactation. Unless the mother is starving, however, fat stored in the
breasts is not normally metabolized to make milk, nor arc large breasts per se
(as opposed to generalized body fat) correlated with being able to produce
more milk.
    What is unusual about womanly breasts is how early they appear. Breast
development begins at puberty, even before menarche, years before a woman
is capable of conceiving or needs breasts to suckle babies. Other primates
have prominent breasts, but this tissue builds up only prior to and during lac­
tation. After weaning, monkey mothers revert to the flat-chested, button­
nippled look of females who have never had a baby.

    The disconnect between permanently enlarged breasts and lactation leads
some biologists to speculate that breasts evolved as advertisements, but not
just of their nutritional stores. Symmetrical spheres of fatty tissue might
show ofT a woman's phenotypic <luality, demonstrating how resistant she has
been to disease and the various other developmental insults life dishes out. 7
The primary function of breasts, however, remains milk production.
    Lactation and Lifestyles
Mother's milk-how lean or fat it is, how long lactation lasts-can reveal a
surprising amount about lifestyle. Among small mammals, such as tree
shrews or hares, high metabolic rates mean mothers must constantly forage
to support themsekes and their litters. Mothers arc away from their nests
hours or days at a stretch. Only unusually rich, high-fat milk tides the infants
over these long absences. By comparison, infants born to early hominids­
whose mothers carried them--were in constant access to their mother's
nipples. Hence, like all primates, they could survive on dilute milk with
moderate amounts of protein and fat and high levels of sugars. This milk,
composed of 88 percent water and, like cow's milk, 3 to 4- percent fat, is spe­
cially adapted to the needs of an infant who will be able to nurse for a few
minutes several times an hour and go on nursing for many months. 8
    Lactation is a perpetual buyer's market, in the sense that intensity of suck­
ling adjusts supply to demand from the consumer, except that in some mam­
mals the seller (meaning the mother) determines the size of the consumer to
begin with. Mothers in good condition produce larger infants who require
more milk sooner. Depending on her own condition, a mother may wean
sooner if she is finding the burden too much to bear, or later, if she has a small
litter or they are growing slowly.
It is easy for humans to fall into the anthropocentric trap of assuming that
there is something inherently superior about placental mammals like our­
selves who gestate embryos till they become babies. In fact, whether or not
our own slower, more deliberate mode of reproduction is actually superior
depends on the em·ironment. In terms of the art of iteroparity as practiced by
mammals who breed sequentially in totally unpredictable, extreme environ­
ments, none surpasses that of marsupials. Marsupial mammals give birth

      Adapted to the unpredictable rainfall of the Australian outback, kangaroos
  have evolved a veritable breast-milk cafeteria to cater to infants of different
  ages. At one nipple, the mother produces low-fat "growth formula" for the
  tiny joey latched on in her pouch. Simultaneously, a distended nipple beside it
  is producing a high-fat "activity formula" for the older joey hopping beside
  her who comes back for an occasional drink. 9
      The kangaroo's ovarian assembly line is specifically geared for high
  turnover. Should either the joey in her pouch or the joey at foot for any rea­
  son cease to suckle, levels of the nursing hormone prolactin-her body's
  work order for more milk-fall precipitously. At this signal the tiny blasto­
  cyst in waiting (a nearly hollow globe of cells produced by the fertilized egg,
  inside of which an embryo will develop) is activated. The spare blastocyst
'"emerges from developmental dormancy (diapause) to serve as a replace-
  ment.
      Mortality in the outback is so high that a reproductively less flexible
  species would by now be as extinct as dinosaurs. But a kangaroo is a mother
  for any season. She simultaneously juggles progeny at three different phases

High-fat milk does not always mean the manufacturer is an absentee mother
like a tree shrew. Sometimes rich milk is delivered in a hurry: in worlds
where mother and infant are likely to be separated soon, it needs to be.
Hooded seals, although relatively large mammals, have one of the shortest
periods of lactation known-as brief as a week. Mothers stockpile blubber in
advance, then give birth atop ice floes to pups who imbibe pure cream--a
high-protein formula containing 6o percent fat, approximately 1 ,4oo calo­
ries in an eight-ounce glass.
    A seal pup can gain fifty pounds in a matter of days. It needs to. If brittle
nursery platforms crack apart, weaning can befall them at any moment, leav­
ing a pup alone in a frigid world where only the plump survive.

With rare exceptions like the Dyak fruit bat, lactation is a female specialty.
Males do not normally produce milk.12This may have to do with the fact that
in animals with internal fertilization and gestation, the mother is the only
parent who can be absolutely certain the infant is hers; males, by contrast,
should evoh·e to be more wary about investing in offspring possibly not their
own. Taking into account the resources she has already committed to gesta­
tion, it is her infant's dependence on milk and her ability to provide it (not
her own sex per se) that seals her fate.
    Gh·en that infant provisioning has not always been sex-specific, and that it
is not necessarily so, how did lactation come to be this utterly critical,
uniquely female specialization? What left mothers holding the teat?

     Prolactin and Caretaking
No one knows how lactation first evolved, but among the "accessories after
the fact," the lactation-promoting hormone called prolactin is an obvious sus­
pect. This simple protein, clearly implicated in lactation, and named in honor
of its pro-lactating function, is so ancient, versatile, multipurpose, and wide­
spread, that its fingerprints are everywhere-at the "crime scene" and every­
place else as well. Prolactin could just as well be called the "stress hormone,"
or, even more aptly, the "parenting hormone."
     Unquestionably, prolactin was around, and a play er, when lactation got
under way. But unfortunately (for those seeking simple answers), prolactin
was also around and a player in bird and fish species, among which lactation
never got started. Secreted by the pituitary, prolactin molecules crop up in
both sexes of a broad array of animals and are implicated in hair maturation,
puberty, fat metabolism, and coping with stress. For several hundred million
y ears before mammals ever appeared, prolactin was regulating metamorpho­
sis in amphibians and water balance in the tissues of bony freshwater fish. Yet
it is a curious feature of this hormone that wherever mothers or allomothers
are motivated to protect or provision y oung, prolactin can be detected at ele­
vated levels.
    The role of prolactin is not easy to interpret. W hen Cambridge University
primatologist Alan Dixson first reported levels of circulating prolactin five
times higher in male marmosets carry ing offspring around than in males not
carrying any, his report was greeted with skepticism by experienced endocri­
nologists who knew that prolactin also goes up when animals are stressed.
They hy pothesized that the testing procedure itself was the source of the dis­
parity-specifically, that a male on childcare duty would be far more stressed
by having his blood sampled than would a male on his own.
    In an ideal form of this experiment, scientists would somehow block the
effect of prolactin, then artificially replace the hormone and monitor what
effect these molecules have on caretaking. But technically, this is hard to do.
We have only tantalizing hints about the function of this protean and ubiqui­
tous hormone, nothing definitive. Even without the perfect experiment, it is
already clear that stress was not causing Dixson's results. Experimenters also
found high levels of prolactin in male caretakers when samples were obtained
from unrestrained donors who were not stressed. Later, similar patterns were
also found in the California mouse, where monogamously mated males are
heavily involved in caretaking from birth to weaning.13

     Prolactin levels spike when male sea horses gestate. 14 They arc elevated in
both sexes whenever scrub jay alloparents (typically year-old nonbreedcrs of
both sexes) fly off and bring food back to nestlings. Among tamarins, pro­
lactin levels go up in males right after their mates give birth. Prolactin levels
rise higher in experienced than in inexperienced, first-time fathers, which is
also true for mothers in species where mothers do most of the caring. 15
     Curiously, prolactin is also unusually high in contexts that seem more
nearly offensive or defensive than nurturing, such as aggression in difense cf
irifants, or when birds engage in tactics of disinformation to fool predators. In
a wide variety of birds, especially those that nest on the ground (like kildeer,
mallards, or gadwalls), the mother (often both parents) will flounder con­
spicuously on the ground, seemingly helpless, pretending to have a broken
wing or other incapacitating injury to distract predators who have gotten too
close to her nest. The nearer her eggs are to hatching, and especially if she has
chicks, the greater the risks this daredevil takes, letting the coyote or dog get
heart-stoppingly close before she takes evasive action. I've seen mother gad­
walls in the grass, flushed by a dog, just make it to the water's edge, flapping
and dragging one wing all the way, and then lead the dog swimming in circles
in pursuit of what looks to all the world like a hopelessly crippled bird,
before she dives one last time, surfaces, and miraculously flies away, her
chicks hidden in the grass on the other side of the pond. Either as instigator
for this behavior, or as a consequence of it, prolactin levels in birds engaging
                             6
in these displays shoot up.1
     Heroics aside, the higher the prolactin levels, the more attentive to infant
needs both males and females, both parents and alloparents, are. Somehow
high prolactin levels are implicated when mothers lactate and when alloparents
just help out. Possibly they interact with other hormones in ways that make
prolactin more nearly accomplice than ringleader. Engaging in nurturing
behaviors, in turn, seems to make the pituitary secrete more prolactin. (As
Eliot put it, "Our deeds determine us, as much as we determine our deeds.")
     The Ambassador of Caretaking
 Hormones like prolactin specialize in cell-to-cell communication. They are
ambassadors, not so much empowered to cause results as equipped to alter
the probability that, once activated, signals are passed on. (The word hormone
derives from the Greek "to urge on.")
     Neurons in the brain are the actual orchestrators of behavioral acts, and
                         MOTHERS          AND      ALLOMOTHERS
the integrators of behavioral states. Hormones are just the instigators, and
their effectiveness depends on how receptive to their message the target
tissues are. Hormones have an effect only where tissues are predisposed to
listen. The behavioral endocrinologist John Wingfield sums up current
knowledge on this subject thusly: it's the neuronal circuits that"cause behav­
ior"; hormones merely "influence the rate at which a behavioral trait may be
expressed under appropriate circumstances."
    The cowbirds Wingfield studies provide a curious example. These justifi­
ably unpopular birds build no nests, nor do they care for young. Rather, cow­
birds are brood parasites who lay their eggs in the nests of other birds.
Cuckolded parents find themselves in the position of bringing food back to
feed an alien chick who has grown to twice the size of the legitimate denizens
of the nest, and easily lords it over them, out-competing the host's own
chicks for food.*
    Yet even among these nest parasites, levels of prolactin circulating in the
blood go up after egg-laying.17 The difference is, cowbird mothers do not
then caretake. One suggestion is that in cowbirds the neural receptors to pro­
lactin arc insensitive to its message. Or perhaps other stimuli must also be
present to elicit caring. Even while experiments with cowbirds continue,
what is already clear is that, once targeted tissue starts to "listen," cells
become increasingly sensitized to the message and may induce changes in
production of the message elsewhere. This is why when endocrinologists are
asked "Docs the hormone cause behavior or docs the behavior cause the hor-
mone.?" thcy sm1"1e wry I y and answer, "V        1es.,18
There arc very few good ideas that are really new; there are even fewer new
molecules. Rather than resorting to spanking new products, which might

appear to have been designed. It is easy to forget that the original recipe for
lactation was slapped together from leftovers.
    Origin ofLactation
Prolactin is a true endocrinological jack-of-all-trades, implicated in a broad
range of physiological activities, from maintaining water balance to seem­
ingly bizarre displays undertaken to lure predators away from nests.True to
its eclectic heritage, this versatile hormone best known for inducing milk
production-and later named for that connection-was not even first dis­
covered in a mammal.
    Prolactin was first identified when endocrinologists injected a mystery
substance into birds and noticed that, whatever it was, these molecules caused
birds of both sexes to develop brood patches on their breasts, areas of heavily
vascularized naked skin that brooding birds apply, like heating pads, against
incubating eggs.
    In 1 9H Oscar Riddle identified the substance as prolactin and discovered
that an injection of it induces broodiness in birds. Whether in hens or cas­
trated males, increased levels of prolactin are associated with a bird's urge to
hover over, cover, and keep either eggs or young warm and safe. Brooding
urges can be so strong that they are extended indiscriminately to young of
other species.
    Among such birds as pigeons, doves, emperor penguins, and flamingos,
prolactin also stimulates males and females to produce "crop milk," a cheesy
concoction of partially digested food diluted with mucus sloughed off from
cells lining their throats. These ingredients may sound unappetizing to people
accustomed to our own fare of lipid-rich excretions from cows' udders, but
this fatty stuff has an avid following among just-hatched squabs, pigeon
fanciers, and intellectuals intrigued by unisex roles in nurturing young. 19
    "Though a man does not brood like a pigeon ... ," lamented Jean­
Jacques Rousseau in the eighteenth century, monogamous father birds among
mourning doves regularly regurgitate more crop milk into the beckoning
beaks of babes than the mothers do.20 This makes one wonder what a shot of
prolactin might do for the sensibilities of indifferent fathers. (For more on
this father of the Enlightenment's own fathering, see p.310.)
    Here and there parentally manufactured baby foods can be found: for
example, the protein provided her young by the breed-and-then-die spider
mothers, whose dissolving bodies are consumed, or the milky substance

Fig. 6.6 Among wolves, subordinate females sometimes undergo pregnancy-like hormonal
changes, including clevatt•d prolactin levels and milk production, even though not actually preg­
nant . Pseudopregnancy can lead to fascinating, if maladaptive, behaviors among their descen­
dants now living under \'cry different conditions. The mother of these kittens was no doubt
puzzled when a pseudopregnant Jack Russell terrier bitch drove her away, adopted her kittens,
and then settled down to suckle them. (Sarah 111'!/Jtr 1/rJy/Anthro-Phoro)
cichlid fish secrete on their scales, a mixture of skin and mucus that is nibbled
ofT by fingerlings. But compared to crop milk and these other substances, lac­
tation stands out because it involves specialized equipment (mammary
glands) developed in only one sex.
    The fact that mammary glands developed in just one sex indicates that lac­
tation originally evolved in some animal where eggs were tended primarily
by mothers, and newly hatched infants were already in close proximity to
their mothers. Otherwise, there seems to be no reason why both sexes
wouldn't lactate, just as both sexes in birds produce crop milk.
    The best extant facsimiles for ancient mammals are the monotremes .
Monotremes arc egg-layers, like birds, but after the eggs hatch on!J' mothers
ever care for them. The female duck-billed platypus, for example, incubates
her eggs safe inside a grass-lined burrow. Sealed up with their mother, the
hatchlings feed on milk dripping from hairs surrounding teatless milk­
producing glands on her front. Suppose, Darwin had speculated, a sweat
gland of an egg-layer got plugged up in some reptilian precursor to mam­
mals. Suppose the resulting secretions just happened to enhance the survival

of a hatchling who imbibed them. Monotremes make Darwin's accidental­
provisioning hypothesis seem quite plausible.
     The main alternative theory to explain how lactation got started is similar
in outline. The disinfectant hypothesis posits antibacterial defense of eggs
rather than nutritional benefits to infants as the initial benefit. Biologists
Daniel Blackburn and Virginia Hayssen propose that a particular component
of bodily secretions called lysozymes-enzymes present in human tears and
blood that digest bacteria-was present in secretions accidentally applied to
eggs. If this serendipitous secretion happened to protect eggs from fungi and
bacteria during incubation, then leaking mothers would have higher hatching
success than mothers who ran tighter ships. (And what better facilitator for a
leak than prolactin, a venerable regulator of water balance.)
     If eggs were being incubated someplace as damp and dark as a marsupial's
pouch, all the more reason why dousing them with some lysozyme-rich dis­
infectant might enhance maternal reproductive success. In support of the
hypothesis, Hayssen points out that a protein specific to mother's milk (alpha­
                                                21
lactalbumin) evolved from lysozymes.
     Newly hatched babies who lapped up this protein-rich antibiotic would
ha,·e gotten a nutritional boost along with their immunological dose. If
 q6                 MOTHERS         AND  ALLOMOTHERS
the antibacterial hypothesis is correct, colostrum, the thick yellowish fluid
present in the breasts before and for several days after birth, may be the clos­
est analogue to ancient mother's milk . Colostrum is packed with antibodies
but, among humans at least, contains only a sixth of the calories found in the
                                 22
thinner, blue-tinged real thing.
    Across cultures and through time, opinions about colostrum have been
remarkably variable. For reasons that no one understands, people from popu­
lations as disparate as the foraging !Kung, peasants in contemporary rural
Haiti, and medical doctors in seventeenth-century England have all deemed
colostrum harmful and advised mothers to express it, rather than risk their
newborns ingesting it. Within days of birth, colostrum is replaced by real
milk, and suckling is postponed till then. Given colostrum's beneficial conse­
quences, this delay and waste seem strange. When historian of medicine
Valerie Fildes took a closer look at changes in British breast-feeding practices
over time, she discovered a dramatic decline in infant death rates in the first
month after birth right at the time doctors changed their mind and mothers
were recommended to once again put babies to their breasts immediately
after birth. 23 History books don't normally have much to say about colos­
trum, but it is increasingly evident that this one is an aperitif with conse­
quences.
    Cellular Equivalent of a Pharmacy
Although parents in some cultures dispose of colostrum, in many others they
incorporate colostrum, with its special properties, into customary childcare.
An American nurse collecting a milk sample in a Swedish clinic was surprised
when a new father requested a dab of the fluid. He immediately smeared it on
the baby's rump. "Why?" she asked. "Oh, to prevent diaper rash. A drop of
milk can also be applied in the baby's eyes, to prevent infections." Like
colostrum, milk too provides some immunological protection.
    Laboratory experiments corroborate such folk wisdom. Fresh mother's
milk in a test tube kills one of the main dysentery-causing amoebas, Enta­
moeba histolytica, along with another common diarrhea-causing parasite, Giar­
dia Iamblia. A particular glycoprotein in mother's milk (lactadherin) has been
shown to protect against rotavirus, one of the major causes of infantile diar­
rhea. I loved the heroic gentle-David-slays-dangerous-Goliath ring to the title
of the first antiamoeba experiments published in the journal Science: "Human
Milk Kills Parasitic Intestinal Protozoa," it announced. 24
                             THE    MILKY      WAY                          137
Immunological defenses arc transmitted from mother to fetus through the
placenta, and after birth they are imbibed by the infant from mother's
colostrum and milk. Immunological protection ranks as one of the most
important of all "maternal effects." These antibodies arc tailor-made to pro­
tect the infant from precisely those bacteria, viruses, and intestinal parasites
that arc present in the environment and that the baby is in greatest danger of
contracting. Like the cellular equivalent of a pharmacy, the mother's mam­
mary glands deliver secretory immunoglobulins that work like specialized
prescriptions.
    Lest anything so essential for survival be left to chance, the mother is
reexposcd every time she ingests her baby's excretions-another good rea­
son in addition to hygiene why mother mammals (probably no one in your
family) spend so much time licking their babies. Exposed to the same
pathogens her infants arc, she manufactures just the right antibodies. By the
fourth month of lactation, a human mother secretes up to half a gram of anti­
body into her milk daily.25 Thus are mammalian young permitted the ines­
timable luxury of an immune system that revs up slowly, over a period of
weeks and months.
    Elixirs of Contentment
Breast-feeding meant prolonged proximity between mother and offspring. In
addition to providing a new delivery route for antibacterial agents like those
in colostrum, breast-feeding also led to the evolution of brand-new chemical
agents with the unprecedented task of promoting intimacy.
    I have been told that the feeling of euphoria that I experienced after the
birth of my first child was a sign that one of these, the peptide hormone oxy­
tocin, was present in large amounts. Even more fascinating is the likelihood
that when my daughter breast-fed, some of the circulating "peace and bond­
ing" hormones in me were transmitted in my milk to her, acting as a mild
sedative, leaving us both with the impression that being near each other was
deeply satisfying. Unlike prolactin, oxytocin does not have much of a track
record outside of the mammals. Apparently, this kindest of natural opiates is a
relative newcomer on the endocrinological scene, a true mammalian spe­
cialtv.

    Oxytocin is manufactured in both the brain and the body (in the ovaries or

testes). All during pregnanc y, my pituitar y had been expanding, and extra
receptors to oxytocin had set up shop in my brain and also in my uterus,
where oxytocin would soon have a special job to do. 26 As the birth process
began, pulses of oxytocin set off contractions in the smooth muscles of my
uterus, causing my daughter to be expelled in a matter of hours-hence the
name oxytocin, from the Greek okus for "swift" and tokos for "birth."
                             THE     MILKY      WAY                          139
    Two days later, as my milk came in, my daughter's sucking mouth stimu­
lated my nipples and signaled the pituitary to release more oxytocin, which
traveled in the blood to the mammary glands and caused the smooth muscles
around cavities where milk is stored to contract and reply to her request with
a thin stream of milk. As I became more conditioned to nursing, just the
thought of her, or her cry, was enough to trigger this "let-down reflex" and
cause a patch of wetness on my blouse. 27
    In spite of its no-nonsense official function, the hormone for swift birth is
profoundly implicated in more subjective responses as well-the rush of
warm sensations that suffuse a mother when she breast-feeds, the tapering off
of inhibitions as two mammals sit companionably side by side, or groom each
other, or when longtime mates nuzzle or rub each other. Oxytocin levels go
up wheneYer a person undergoes a good massage. Manipulation of the breasts
or genitals during lovemaking also stimulates release of higher levels of oxy­
tocin, which is probably why a marked increase in oxytocin is detected dur­
              28
ing orgasm.
    Some women-as well as men-are unnerved by what they perceive
as the "sexual" sensations mothers experience during breast-feeding. Tales
abound of officials at public welfare agencies who react negatively to mater­
nal confessions about sensual feelings from nursing their children. Some go
so far as to seek removal of the offspring from so "perverting" an influence. It
might be helpful for all concerned to keep in mind that maternal sensations
have clear evolutionary priority in the pleasure sphere. Long before any
woman found sexual foreplay or intercourse pleasurable, her ancestors were
selected to respond positively to similar sensations produced by birth and
suckling, because finding these activities pleasurable would help condition
her in ways that kept her infant alive. It would be more nearly correct, then,
to refer to the "afterglow" from climax as an ancient "maternal" rather than
sexual response.
How susceptible an animal is to the magic of oxytocin may vary depending on
its evolutionary history. This realization led neuroendocrinologist Sue Carter
to predict that oxytocin would be more important in animals with long-term
pair bonds, where affiliative relations between the sexes are translated into
enhanced infant sur vival. This is precisely what her colleague Tom Insel
                   MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
found: many more brain receptors to oxytocin in monogamous prairie voles
than in a closely related but more solitary species of vole in which males mate
polygynously with several females in a love-' em-and-leave-' em pattern. 29
    Lactation and Destiny
Which came first, the chicken or the egg? The egg obviously, answers evolu­
tionist John Hartung: "It was laid by a bird one mutation away from being a
chicken." Nothing about the therapsid reptile that laid the egg that became
the first milk-secreting creature could possibly have foretold how far-ranging
the repercussions of this mutation would be. Out of what initially may have
been little more than a bead of sweat, a new prolactin-mediated, medicated
growth formula would emerge. There was nothing about the origin of lacta­
tion to indicate that it would ever have anything to do with the evolution of
intelligence, but it did .
   Three things about lactation were new. Undoubtedly some mothers had
previously been sole caretakers among reptiles or birds, but both males and
females would have been equivalently equipped to protect the nest and,
when it increased their reproductive success, to provision young. Lactation
was a caretaking adaptation linked to a specific sex as never before.
    Second, this uniquely valuable formula for keeping infants alive would
make the individuals who produced milk an even more valuable, even more
limited resource than egg producers already were. As usual, males would
compete for females, but with new ramifications to the old mating game, as
females producing young then also nursed them. Each offspring that sur vives
past weaning would have extracted enormous somatic investment from the
mother, not to mention the opportunity costs-time out of her life spent
nursing offspring she already has instead of making more. Mothers who could
not sustain lactation long enough to make all that it cost her worthwhile
would be selected against. Hence female ovarian functioning became more
sensitive than ever to maternal condition and local circumstances. The longer
the inter vals between conceptions, the fewer fertile, ovulating females will
be available to males. Lactation became one more factor intensifying com­
petition between males for access to fertile females. Furthermore, other
mothers, as well as males, would sometimes enter the fray to control the pro­
ducers of this biological white gold.
   The third innovation was the prolonged intimacy between mothers and
infants that the availability of mother's milk permitted, and eventually
                              THE     .MILKY     WAY
required. Of the three corollaries accompanying lactation, this last­
prolonged intimacy-would be the most significant for the evolution of
social relationships and eventually new parts of the brain, and new attributes
(especially intelligence linked to empathy) that, because we possess them, are
of special interest to human beings.
    Parenting behaviors were old hat, but intimate social relationships, and
the ncuroendocrinological underpinnings that evolved in the brain to main­
tain them, were very new. Where ecological conditions permitted daughters
to remain near mothers, they did so, enjoying the protection and social sup­
port from birth such as only a mother and her matrilineal kin routinely offer.
    The Beginnings ofSocial Intelligence
The parts of the brain devoted to biological regulation (heart rate, breathing)
and the most basic drives and instincts (hunger, libido) and reflexes ("fight or
flight," primal fears) arc linked to the limbic system, which is located near the
brain stem and hypothalamus Gust behind the knobby part below your ear).
Atop this older, "reptilian" brain, mammals evolved the newer, cortical por­
tions of the brain, in particular the neocortex, which increases its possessor's
ability to evaluate situations, weigh costs and benefits, plan and make deci­
sions contingent on circumstances, including (and most especially) social
circumstances. Though evolutionarily more recent than the subcortical por­
tions, this neocortex is not entirely independent of them.
    Evaluations made at the level of the neocortex can override those of the
older parts of the brain, but these determinations are not free of limbic input.
As pcrsuash·ely argued by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, rational decisions
are continuously informed by old emotions. It is as if, without this primitive
input, the brain ceases to plan in ways that enhance the survival and long­
term fitness of the organism.
    Not surprisingly, the more complicated the situations that an animal needs
to evaluate, the larger (relative to body size) the neocortex needs to be. All
mammals with complex social behavior have an expanded executive neocor­
tex compared with the rest of the forebrain. Across the Primate order,
species with larger group sizes also have relatively larger neocortices. 30 Add
to this one of the strangest findings to emerge so far from genetics and neuro­
science.
    Ever since Mendel, scientists have understood that offspring inherit traits
from their mother and from their father, depending on the genes they receive
                   MOTHERS          AND    ALLOMOTHERS
from each parent. Yes, but not exactly. Sometimes equivalent genes are
expressed differently depending on which parent they comefrom. At least some of
the time, this is due to a process called "genetic imprinting," which silences or
inactivates information carried on the gene originating from the other par­
ent. One of the most fascinating albeit still poorly understood cases of
parent-specific gene expression has to do with a gene that affects a person's
ability to adjust to social situations.
   Like many extraordinary genetic discoveries, this finding began with an
investigation of a genetic defect. It involved individuals born with only one X
chromosome. Neither XY (a boy) nor XX (a normal girl), XO girls never
develop ovaries, and they exhibit a suite of other traits known as "Turner's
syndrome." D. H. Skuse and colleagues at the Institute of Child Health in
London noticed a curious difference among girls with Turner's syndrome
depending upon whether they received their lone X chromosome from their
mother or their father. Although most people assume that women tend to be
more socially adept than men are, girls whose X chromosome derived from
their mother were less socially competent and less able to weed out distract­
ing impulses than were Turner's syndrome girls who received their X chro­
mosome from their father. T hese results led Skuse to speculate that many of
the developmental disorders in speech and reading ability, as well as more
severe conditions such as autism, to which boys are especially vulnerable,
might have to do with silencing of a gene influencing social cognition and lan­
guage that rides on the X chromosome.
   It seems odd and counterintuitive that a Turner's syndrome daughter· with
her only X from her mother would be less sociable than a Turner's syndrome
daughter who receives her lone X chromosome from her father. One possi­
ble explanation for this bizarre outcome emerges as soon as we think about it
in the evolutionary context in which mammalian mothers ordinarily gave
birth to sons and daughters.
    Genetic anomalies aside, under what circumstances does an individual
normally receive a single X from its mother? T his happens every time a nor­
mal male is conceived. For under normal circumstances, a son's lone X chro­
mosome always derives from his mother. T hat son's lone X chromosome
would ordinarily be the only X chromosome ever unmatched and unbuffered
hy any corresponding chromosome apart from the characteristic little Y that
male mammals have. If disinclination to form social relationships, or inepti­
tude at doing so, resulted from an unbuffered maternal X, all the better. It

would reduce the incentive lot· a son to stay home. Fat· among most mam­
mals, it is females who remain among their kin (or arc "female philopatric" or
"matrilocal") and males who depart to go fight and breed someplace else,
usually among strangers and away from their matrilineal kin. By contrast,
daughters endowed with a "fi·icndly" X chromosome from their dad to bal­
ance out the "irascible" X ti·otn their mom will be the ones most likely to stick
around. This of course is pure speculation on my part. Cambridge University
neurophy siologist Eric Kcvcrnc's explanation for the evolution of self­
conscious intelligence in mammals is even wilder.
   The Origins of Compassion
Almost all zoologists agree that if mammals arc going to live in social groups,
by and large it is the daughters who remain ncar their mothers, among their
matrilineal kin. This is true for almost all prosimians and monkeys as well as
for mammals generally. With this in mind, Kevcrnc proposed that prolonged
association among female relatives was the social environment of evolution­
ary relevance in which the "executive" regions of the brain evolved. These arc
the areas of the cortex that enable animals to size up social situations and
devise coherent strategies to cope with them. Selection pressures favoring
evolution of the executive brain cannot be understood without taking into
account these matrilineal groupings. 31
    Extraordinary experimental evidence coming out of Keverne's lab pro­
vides indirect support for the idea that social intelligence originated in a
matrilineal context. Kevernc and coworkers showed that genes inherited
from the mother have more influence on the newer, "executive" portions of
the brain than do those inherited from the father. Keverne used specially bred
mice to investigate this parent-specific gene expression. When he blocked out
maternal input, babies were born brawny but small-brained. When paternal
input was blocked, however, bodies were smaller, but brains were enormous.
'Whereas in the hypothesis about irascible sons and affiliative daughters from
the XO example, sons were rendered more likely to leave, in Keverne's
model the mothers render daughters more sociable, more likely to stay and
be intelligent in their dealings with others. And why not? Gregarious, socia11y
skilled daughters will remain nearby to interact with her and with hers.
    But a mother's contributions arc not just physiological. She also passes on

individuals her developing infants learn to identify as "familiar conspecifics"
and therefore come to identify and treat like "kin."32
     If corroborated, Keverne's work will qualify mammalian social attributes
and the relationships that go with them as the most stunning maternal effects
on record. Every creature with the social intelligence to respond to others as
individuals and form enduring relationships shares this common mammalian
heritage. All descended from distant ancestresses whose life cycle was char­

It is early days still in this remarkable research going on at the interface of
genes, neuroscience, and behavior. Yet already it is clear that the "milky way"
initiated the evolution of a charmed rclatio_nship between dependent imma­
tures and their hostess. Many organisms, from coral reefs to wasps, arc social;
even a tadpole or a sea squirt has sufficient neurons to discriminate kin from
nonkin. All kinds of other animals respond to stimuli and signals by reflex­
ively providing a service to another-say, a father bird popping food into a

opportunist Mother Nature get to try out different neuroendocrine combi­
nations and select for the ones that promoted the social relationships most con­
ducive to infant survival and to the mother's long-term reproductive success.
Sex may not be destiny in the sense that it is necessarily a female that cares for
offspring, but lactation requires a female to stay near her young. Prolonged
association between mother and suckling young provided both the chance
and necessity for "social intelligence" to evolve.
    Lactation turns out to be a key player in the evolution of animals who
were both social and intelligent . In this sense lactation was a shaper of des­
tinies not just for mothers, but for all individuals who would evolve a capac­
ity for compassion.

   unconditional it can not be controlled or acquired ... because they are all

    n the beginning there is some manageable rodent. Laboratory rats and
    mice are docile, have shor t generation times, and breed readily in plastic
    boxes, which is why so much of what we know about the genetics and
physiology of maternal behavior comes from studies of these small mammals.
    Shortly before she gives birth, a wild mouse transports bits of straw, feath­
ers, fur, or, at my house, cotton stuffing from our sofa, into some safe­
seeming nook. After generations of ar tificial breeding, a white mouse in a
cage still feverishly piles sawdust into a soft mound before settling into the
warm indentation her body creates.
    No prior practice is necessary. Within minutes of giving birth, the mother
mouse bites off the amniotic sac, eats the placenta, and sets about doing the
needful. The same female who just weeks before would have either ignored
or killed any newborn she encountered now gently picks up the pups in her
mouth, one by one, and places them in a warm heap in her nest. If a pup
tumbles out, the mother picks up the rubbery pink sausage and gently puts
it back. Lost pups are located by the ultrasonic vocalizations they emit as chill
sets in.
    Right after giving bir th, the mother is especially attuned to the smells and
sounds of pups. She may also be attracted to their warmth, as they certainly
are to hers. No more outlying squeaks, the mother settles her body over the
huddled pups while they latch on to her nipples and nurse. The specificity of
mammalian mothering boggles the mind. Even in a first-time mother, there is
amazingly little trial, virtually no error. Postpartum housekeeping is direct,
stereotyped, reliable. How can her efficiency in biting off the amniotic sac be
other than "preprogrammed"?Yet we also know that there is sufficient varia­
tion among mothers that a fraction of them never care for pups at all.

     What Is Meant by "Instinctive"
The deliberate way a mother meets infant needs, and the way infants evoke
the necessary responses, testify to a highly integrated, coevolved system. The
mother purposefully licks amniotic fluid and remnant blood off a helpless
morsel that at another time or place she might well eat. She pays special
attention to the anus and genital region. Like most nest- or burrow-dwelling
mammals, stimulation from the mother's licking is essential for urination.
Unless the mother performs this function, pups die.
     Attractive chemicals in pup urine reward the mother for good housekeep­
ing. She replaces her own much-needed electrolytes at the same time she
keeps the burrow from turning into a growth medium for unwanted parasites
and an odoriferous beacon to predators. In some kinds of rodents, mothers
lavish special attention on the genitals of sons, licking them significantly more
than those of daughters. When experimental psychologist Celia Moore
blocked the ability of mothers to tell sons and daughters apart (which
rodents do by smell), she found that sons deprived of this extra stimulation
never de,·eloped neuronal pathways essential for adult sexual functioning.
Is a mother born instinctively nurturing? ("She is a motherly type," I've some­
times heard it said.) Does something inside her change during pregnancy that
makes her maternal? ("Before the baby was born, her nesting instinct really
got going.") Is increased responsiveness due to stimulation from the infant?
("She just fell in love with her new baby.") Is a female gradually primed to be
a mother by experiences?
     For mice at least, the answer to these questions is: all of the above.
"Instinctive" is a reasonable way to describe her maternal behavior, as long as
it is understood that mother mammals do not necessarily exhibit automatic,
full-blown commitment to infants immediately after birth. Rather, her
"maternal instinct" unfolds gradually, in "baby steps" in which infants, too, are
implicated.
    Nature cannot be compartmentalized from nurture, yet something about
human imaginations predisposes us to dichotomize the world that way.
Nature versus Nurture, innate or acquired. The persistence, decade after
decade, of a nonexistent dichotomy puzzles me. The recent discovery that

Fig. 7.1 In ancient China and Japan strains of"dancing mice" were as popular as the latest video
game is today. In China, albino mice were used to divine the future, and the trade in them can be
dated back as early as A.D. 307, small fortunes being paid for the rarest mutants. These illustra­
tions come from an eighteenth-century Japanese text providing instructions for breeding piebald
and dwarf varieties. In Darwin's time British traders carried"fancy mice" back to Europe. By the
early twentieth century, scientists at places like Harvard were using their knowledge about dom­
inant and recessive genes for coat color to study inheritance and by the end of the century to bio­
engineer mice with certain genes"knocked out" in order to learn more about the role of genes in
behavior. (Fiaures arc a compoSitefrom Chobei 7tn!,Ya's 1787 Chingan-sodategusa; "The breedina1'curious •·amtics tfmicc,"

mother mice lacking a particular gene fail to care for their babies inevitably
led to news stories about the gene responsible for "the very essence of moth­
ering," as if with the gene she had it, without it she did not. The "nature of
nurture" (as the headlines put it) may not be innate, but the need to organize
information into neat binary oppositions like Nature versus Nurture may
well be.1

    Genotype to Phenotype
Scientists have long suspected that a specific area of a mammal's brain (the
preoptic area of the hypothalamus) plays a critical role in sending instructions
for behaviors related to nurturing. It is in the hypothalamus that a family of
four genes known as "fos genes" arc typically expressed. Fos genes work like
master switches in an electrical system; they activate, or "turn on," other
genes.
    In order to study how switch genes work, Jennifer Brown, working with
Michael Greenberg at Harvard Medical School, engineered a new genetic
strain of mice lacking just one gene, known as fosB. These "knockout" mice
seemed otherwise normal. It ought to be possible to compare mice without
the fosB gene with those that had one, and in that way learn what the gene
docs.
    The first step was to get fosB-less mice to reproduce so that sufficient
numbers of knockout mice would be on hand for large-scale studies. Mice
missing the fosB gene were slightly smaller, but otherwise healthy, able to
mate, become pregnant, and deliver viable young. W hen the next generation
of mutants was born, however, it became apparent that something was very
wrong: almost all pups born to mothers lacking a fosB gene died within two
days of birth. Were they infected with something, or defective, Brown won­
dered. Closer examination revealed that the problems were not physiologi­
cal. Furthermore, if taken away and placed with a foster mother, they did
fine. The problem was not with the babies, but what appeared to be an
absence of maternal care. Within a day or two after birth, pups died of cold
and starvation. 2
    The mother's hearing and sense of smell seemed fine; maternal hormones
like oxytocin and progesterone were within the normal range; mammary
glands were producing milk. So why was she neglecting her pups? If anyone
was looking for an evolutionary sine qua non, so far as mammalian posterity
was concerned, the fosB gene in mice sure looked like it. But can a gene be
the "essence of mothering"?
    No. All a gene can do is code for particular proteins. Getting from mole­
cules to complex behaviors is a more complicated and dynamic process. In
mammals such processes tend to be sensitive to social and environmental
conditions, responses that depend on external stimuli (like the presence of
pups) and are altered by the mother's own past experiences. It is not that fosB

Fig. 7. 2 The research being done in Michael Greenberg's lab was focused on how switch genes
worked, not on mothering. Yet it seemed strange that almost all of the pups born to the geneti­
cally engineered "knockout" mothers were left outside the nest, cold, hungry and sending des­
perate ultrasonic signals---to no avail. As Jennifer Brown put it later, at first the infant mortality
"was enough to pique my interest and provoke me to do a larger experiment but not enough to
make me think there was that much going on."1 (&produced bJ permission '![Jennifer BroH'n and Cdl)
genes cause mothers to mother, but that the absence of fosB genes means
something essential in the sequence of interactions that elicit maternal behav­
ior in a hormonally primed female never happens-rather like being on a
treasure hunt but missing one clue.
    The fosB gene is responsible for one link in a cascade of signals from the
mother's brain to other parts of her body. But it is a critical link. Brown sug­
gests the following, still tentative, explanation: The first time a mother sniffs
pups, their smell triggers a nerve signal that activates fosB genes in her brain.
FosB genes in turn switch on other genes, which sensitize her hypothalamus
to this cascade of signals. One eventual target of the signals may be nerves in
the mouth and jaw that facilitate behavior essential for the retrieval of the
pups, since to gather the pups together, the mother must pick up each one in
her mouth. If the caretaker fails to gather pups into a squir ming squeaking
clump radiating pup smells, none of the other scc1uenccs of behavior that arc
elicited in response to such audio-olfactory cues ever get going.4
    Whether or not Brown's scenario is the one researchers still usc a decade
hence, her point is well taken . Rather than the "essence" of mothering, what
is missing here is activation by a gene in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus

may or may not he relevant to animals (monkeys, for example) where new­
borns cling to their mothers. W hen pressed to spell out the connection
between fosB and mothering in humans, the researchers themselves, wisely
and warily, replied: "There is a fosB gene in humans. From there it's up to

\Vhat happens if a mother mouse lacking a gene for a critical step in the
emergence of nurturing has that link in the cascade of responses artificially
performed for her? We don't know yet. But imagine that the pups of a fosB­
less mother were automatically placed in a position where she would nurse
them. Would other maternal behaviors then unfold as usuai?We already know
that Mother Nature's designs arc riddled with fail-safes, redundancies, and
alternath·e routes.
    Being pregnant and giving birth is not the only route to becoming mater­
nal. Psy chologists discovered long ago the phenomenon called "sensitization."
A virgin female rat, for example, will either ignore or devour a pup she hap­
pens upon. But if she is repeatedly exposed to pups, this inexperienced "au
pair from hell" becomes quite nurturing-without undergoing the hormone
changes specific to pregnancy. W hen experimenters place pups in her cage
again and again, eventually she stops killing and begins to care for them .
    Most rodent females (as well as many males) can be conditioned to lick
babies, crouch over them protectively, tenderly pick them up in their teeth
and carry them back when they stray. Once the message starts to get
through, the mere presence of pups produces the urge to care for them.
Clearly, hormonal changes during pregnancy are not absolutely essential. Yet
the same female, once she becomes pregnant, responds to pups faster.6
    In a now classic experiment, blood from a rat who had just given birth was
injected into a virgin female. The transfusion caused a dramatic reduction in
the amount of time it took this virgin to retrieve babies. Within fifteen hours,
virgin females spontaneously gathered up babies without requiring long,
often gory, prior exposure. They hunched the pups together, crouched over
them, and licked them just as a parous mother who had just given birth
would.7
                   MOTHERS          AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    Lactational Aggression
Virgin mice can be induced to perform many of the same caretaking tasks as a
real mother by repeatedly introducing them to pups. But this process (sensiti­
zation) has one marked deficiency: no allomother ever defends infants with
anything like the ferocity of a real mother.
    W ithin days after birth, as milk production gets under way in response to
pupular demand, mothers metamorphose from mild-mannered mice into
relentless biting fur-balls. I have seen a postpartum wild mouse slash the
intruding snout of an eighteen-inch-long snake. Others inflict life-threatening
injuries on members of their own species, male or female. 8
    We are talking about female gladiators who fully deserve Erich Fromm's
epithet "all protective." In the face of such ferocity only the most determined
intruders persevere. Maternal conditioning of others to stay away from her
young pertains in many mammals. If you want to see a large male dog back
slowly away, hold a tiny puppy in front of his nose. Dreading retaliation from
the mother, he avoids the puppy as if it were the wrong end of a furry
magnet.
    The technical term for this Jekyll-to-Hyde transformation is "lactational
aggression." But why should a female be especially aggressive when she is lac­
tating? Even prior to giving birth, life is tough, full of predators and competi­
tors. Partly, of course, an animal intent on defending a nest full of helpless
babies has to be more ready to stand her ground. But Italian sociobiologist
Stefano Parmigiani has proposed a different explanation. A mother with
suckling pups has something special to protect against: conspecifics, in partic­
ular infanticidal males belonging to her own species. 9
    Lactational aggression sets in just as the period of really heavy investment
in her young is under way. It takes a tremendous toll for such a tiny, active,
warm-blooded creature to provide fat-rich mouse milk to seven or eight
babies. Over the three weeks till she weans her pups, a mother mouse weigh­
ing just 2o or so grams herself provides them on the order of 1 oo grams of
milk-five times her own body weight in protein, fat, and sugars. The vast
majority of pups killed by marauding males are killed in the first three days.
From that point on, at least, the mother has reached the point of no return;
                                                                     10
she risks all to defend her litter against trespassing conspccifics.
    A series of gruesome studies done twenty years ago demonstrated that
suckling triggers this transformation. Mothers whose nipples were surgically
removed so they could not suckle did not make the shift into hyperferocity.
                     FROM     HERE TO        MATERNITY
Virgin females treated with hormones so their nipples grew enough for
experimenters to stimulate them (an experimental procedure stimulating
                                                1
both pregnancy and suckling) did turn feisty. 1
    The initial explanation for the aggressiveness of new mothers was preda­
tor defense. Not very much infanticide had been observed, and what had
been seen was assumed to he an artifact of captivity. But more information
was coming in, and Parmigiani pointed out that without the protection pro­
,·idcd by lactational aggression, infanticide would be even more common.12
His argument sounded a bit like the White Knight who explains to Alice that
his horse wears anklets to ward off shark bites. When Alice retorts that there
arc no sharks, he tells her that that just proves the ankle-chaps work. Experi­
ments in which the mother was removed confirmed suspicions that anti­
infanticide protection was warranted. (Today, such attacks are so widely
documented for so many birds and mammals that many animal behaviorists
consider it unethical to do experiments that involve removing a protective
parent in species reported to be infanticidal.) 13
    Maternal Hormones
In real life, a new mother only gets one try. If she ignores her pups, they die.
But not to worry. Shortly after conception, as soon as implantation of the
embryos occurs, the placenta (which operates as an extension of embryos,
and on their behalf) starts to manufacture extra estrogen and progesterone to
sustain the pregnancy, and also, rather like a love potion, to put the mother in
the mood.
    A cascade of endocrinological events during the last third of pregnancy
prepares a mother mouse for love on their first blind date. But there's a hitch.
The pups' supply line, the placenta, which is also the agent serving up this
cocktail, is delivered right along with the babies. Expulsion of the placenta
causes levels of progesterone and estrogen to plummet-seemingly at the
very moment babies most need their mother to imbibe them. Mothers get
one last dose when they eat the hormone-rich, opiate-laced placenta . 14
    Although they helped to get the mother in a nurturing mood, high levels
of progesterone and estrogen can scarcely account for mom's continued
attentiveness. Enter prolactin and oxytocin, the hormones described in the
previous chapter and most often identified with milk production and the let­
down reflex that delivers it. During pregnancy, and especially just prior to
birth, oxytocin receptors build up in the brain. At birth, when pulses of this
                    MOTHERS          AND    ALLOMOTHERS
hormone trigger birth contractions, these natural opiates ensure that the
mother, the creature whose behavior determines the fate of the pups, greets
them in a broody, mellow mood.15
    From rodents to primates, oxytocin promotes affiliative feelings. A mon­
key mother whose brain receptors to these natural opiates are blocked makes
fewer overtures toward her infant, is less likely to put her face near the baby's
and reassuringly smack her lips. Without the warm glow from this most quin­
tessentially mammalian of all hormones-the endocrinological equivalent of
candlelight, soft music, and a glass of wine-monkey mothers tolerate off­
                                                            16
spring, but it's left to the infant to cling for dear life.
    Cues from Pups
Placentally produced steroids (estrogen and progesterone) prime the mother
and put her on the emotional alert to detect infantile scents and sounds.
Once pups slip into the world, dripping in amniotic fluids-which mothers
find irresistibly attractive and potent-and the placenta is consumed, the
mother is primed for pups to continue eliciting her nurturing responses. And
her responses to the pups stimulate production of more maternal hormones.
    As the mother instinctively hovers over her babies, it's up to them to latch
on to her nipples. Their tugging and sucking, in turn, stimulates production
of still more prolactin, intensifying her reactions to the infantile signals these
pups emit. She continues to respond till the pups themselves outgrow the
infantile traits that so turned her on. If the experimenter replaces grown
pups with younger ones, however, a mother can be artificially induced to
              .    17
k eep on nursmg.
    Experiencing the sound and smell of pups, their stimulation of her nip­
ples, and other maternal reactions to them all cause new neural pathways to
form, leading to reorganization in the mother's brain. A mother who has
given birth, or nursed babies, literally develops a different "mindset." Past
experience with pups is one reason why parous mothers respond more
quickly the second time around. A mother's deeds in the form of her past his­
tory do indeed determine her almost as much as she determines them.
    Of Mice and Monkeys
Less is known about how hormones produced during pregnancy affect pri­
mates. Pregnant primates experience hormone changes similar to those in
mice but respond in a much less stereotyped and automatic way. You could
                       FROM    HERE TO MATERNITY
say they arc more "thoughtful." For example, if the baby docs not at first catch
hold, an experienced mother compensates, using her hand to push the baby
up to, and close against, her breast. The main source of this g1·eater flexibility
in primates is the activity in the newer parts of their mammalian brains,
known as the neocortex. Greater reliance on newer portions of the brain
allows primate mothers to respond with greater flexibility than mice. The flip
side of this escape from rigid, stereotypical responses is that practice and
learning become more important-even essential.
    Caged monkeys deprived of opportunities to socialize and interact with
babies make neglectful, sometimes abusive, first-time mothers, yet they
improve with successive infants. 18 Watching these first-time mothers give
birth can be hair-raising. One primiparous, socially inexperienced rhesus
macaque mother was so frightened by her new baby that she leapt to the top
of her cage, the infant swinging by the umbilical cord in the air behind her.
When birth by caesarean section deprives first-time mothers of the experi­
ence of giving birth, they make even worse mothers. Only 3 percent of prim­
iparous monkeys whose first infant was delivered by caesarean section even
picked the baby up off the floor of the cage. They were far more interested in
lapping up the addictive chemicals from the birth fluids that keepers had
smeared on the baby than in the newborn itself. With luck, though, if a baby
is strong enough, luring the mother close this way does the trick. Once the
mother is close (to taste the attractive molecules in the amniotic fluid she has
to lick the baby), a determined and enterprising newborn monkey can catch
hold of its mother's fur and, with all four limbs, like a climber scrambling up
a cliff-face, inch its way over to her breasts. 19
It seems a miracle that infants born to inexperienced first-time mothers ever
survive. That they do is testimony to the initiative as well as hardiness of baby
monkeys. It seems unlikely that primiparae living in natural groups could be
as ill-prepared as their socially deprived peers in captivity; nevertheless, for
reasons still not understood, wild firstborn infants die at high rates. Mortality
rates among firstborn infants can be 6o percent or higher in some popula­
tions of monkeys and apes. Some human groups are also characterized by dis­
                                                                   20
proportionate mortality among infants born to young mothers.
    In light of such dismal odds, one wonders why early conceptions occur at
                   MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
all in these barely mature mothers, until one notes that with physical growth
and practice mother primates (including humans) grow not only bigger
but better with successive infants. In mice, at least, neural pathways in the
mother's brain arc reconfigured just by acts of caretaking. The brain and
responsiveness to maternal hormones and stimuli from pups are different the
second time round; she is really not the same mouse that she was.
    Changes in neural pathways mean that learning-or its physiological
equivalent-has taken place. The role of learning is more important still
in the much more flexible mothering of primates. The real tipoff is the un­
abashed lust to hold and carry babies manifested by young females. Only in a
handful of monkeys do future allomothers actually get to take and carry
babies to their heart's content (and I' ll come to these "infant-sharers" in a
moment).
    "Learning to Mother"
Anywhere in the world, no matter how aloof people seem, no matter how
inappropriate it would be to strike up a conversation with strangers, people
smile and chat up babies. Normal social rules don't apply. Strangers don't
need to be introduced. A woman's overtures arc considered normal. Indeed,
others might disaprove if she fails to evince such interest. Why do primate
females find babies so irresistible?
    Primatologists have long been aware of the magnetic appeal of babies.
Young females from one troop will kidnap an infant from another; orphans
may he adopted by older sisters or grandmothers , even on occasion by
females belonging to different communities. Mexican primatologist Alejan­
dro Estrada tells the story of the graceful spider monkey female, an experi­
enced mother, who adopted an ugly duckling, a chunky, phlegmatic howler
monkey. The spider monkey spontaneously lactated to suckle it.
    As Estrada noted, such spontaneous nurturing of an infant belonging to
another species was obviously not elicited by genetic relatedness, or even by
any trait specific to the adopter's own species. What seemed to count most
was the generalized signals advertising the baby's vulnerability and newness,
or"nconativity." Features relevant to this "natal attraction" include: small size;
the large, rounded head; the awkward way of moving; and, especially, the dis­
tinctive black, snow-white, or golden natal coats baby monkeys arc horn
wearing. (Natal coats and selection pressures on infants to evolve these flam­
boyant signals of hahyncss arc explained in chapter 19, "Why Be Adorable?")

    Why Primates Adopt Infants
    More EasilyThan Sheep Do
Around the world, people were charmed
and amazed by the altruism of Binti Jua, a
gorilla mother at Chicago's Brookfield
Zoo, who gently gathered up a little boy
who fell into her cage. Time magazine
extolled her as "the gorilla of America's dreams." This simian Good Samaritan
sparked excited philosophical debate along the lines of"Docs one have to be
human to be humane?" (Obviously not.)21
    Primatologists were pleased by the good press for a deserving species.
That Binti Jua so readily delivered the toddler to the keeper's door and
handed over her windfall was impressive. All round, the safe outcome was a
great relief. But few familiar with apes were surprised that this female was
attracted to a child.
    All female primates find babies (the younger the better) fascinating, some
more so than others. And why not? Baby-lust improves the chances a new
mother will care for her own baby, and if she is young, motivates her to get
the practice that will make her a more competent caretaker. Finding babies
attractiYe is a luxury primates can afford because the chances are so slim that
a mother will mistake some other female's baby for her own and nurture an
alien infant at the expense of her own. By contrast, in other very social or
herd-dwelling animals, where infants are born more precocial-on their feet
and running within minutes-there would be an ever-present danger that a
mother's milk might be diverted to a stranger while her own infant starved.
Consider a baby lamb or other herd-dwelling ungulate. Minutes-old babies
arc quite capable of wandering over and latching on to the nipple of another
mother in the same herd if she fails to fend them ofi For a mother in such a
species, open-ended tolerance toward babies would be evolutionarily disas­
trous, causing the mother's milk to be diverted to strangers while her own
babies starved. As a result, mothers in such species, mother ewes for exam­
ple, haYe been selected to imprint on the smell of their own baby within min­
utes of birth and thereafter reject babies that don't smell exactly like that.
                   MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    In sheep, the imprinting process begins as the lamb passes through the
birth canal. Dilation of the ewe's cervix induces a surge of oxytocin. For
a brief window of time lasting less than five minutes, neural changes in
response to this pulse of hormones make the mother sensitive to certain
smells, like typing a user code into a computer. 22 Although under normal cir­
cumstances a ewe is repelled by the smell of amniotic fluid (so that a female
would be amenable to this process only after she herself had given birth),
during this sensitive period she finds the scent of amniotic fluid temporarily
irresistible. As the mother avidly licks this slimy ambrosia off her singleton,
twin, or triplet babies, she imprints on the scents in their wool. And then the
door to maternal tolerance slams shut. The mother implacably rejects any
lamb that does not wear the olfactory badge that she just learned to identify.
    Highly discriminating sheep mothers arc the opposite of communal
breeders. There are certain strains of mice, for example, in which a mother
will suckle any baby within ten days or so of the age of her own litter that for
any reason ends up in her nest. Evolutionarily, of course, infants she found
there would likely belong to her sister or some other close relative who
evolved to share a nest this way because of the significant survival advantages
for both mothers' pups.23
    Mother primates fall between these two extremes: they find all babies­
especially very little ones-attractive, hut they learn to discriminate between
their own and other intants. Learning begins shortly after birth, thus reduc­
ing the chances that a mother will ever mistake or prefer another female's
infant to her own, but not precluding the possibility of accepting a foster
baby.
    Based primarily on what is known for humans, a mother primate can iden­
tify her own baby's smell within a day of birth. She can pick out her own
baby's T-shirt from among a soiled pile. Smell and sound arc apparently even
more important than sight. Within forty-eight hours of birth a mother can
differentiate the cry of her own baby from others. 24 Some hospitals find it
worthwhile to record "cry-prints" right along with footprints.
    In humans, much of this learning is happening on a suhliminal lcvcl, such
that when a new mother was recently informed by the hospital a few Jays
after giving birth that a mix-up had occurred, she found it very difficult to
believe ami at first refused to accept her own baby. "I want the baby I brought
home," she told otlicials at the hospital. 25 This mother presumably had
imprinted on her baby immediately after birth, but to a far less definitive

Fig. 7 ·4 Right after birth, ewes arc powerfully attracted to the smell of the viscous film coating
their kids. Licking off this amniotic fluid, they learn to recognize their own infants' smell. Shep­
herds use a process known as "slime grafting" to induce a ewe whose lamb has been born dead to
accept another baby, usually a "bummer" lamb rejected by its own mother. (Since ev..-cs can care
for only two young, and triplets are not rare, redundant, unwanted lambs are not rare either.)
The motherless (bummer) lamb is hog-tied and "slimed" either by placing the bummer under­
neath the dclh·ering ewe's \'agina, or smearing it with the birth fluid. As the mother licks away,
she imprints on the bummer lamb as her own ami thereafter is more likely to allow it to suckle,
and once that happens, to adopt it. (Sarah Bl<ljfor HrJylAnrhro-Phoro)
degree than a sheep would have. With a DNA test and the tincture of time,
the mother came around.
     In the environments in which most humans evolved, there was no possi­
bility that another woman's baby would accidentally be substituted for a
woman's own. If a woman adopted an infant to replace her own, chances
were that foster-baby would be a relative-far and away the most common

circumstance for adoption in both human and nonhuman primate societies_
This is why adoption-especially of very young infants, or when the infant is
a substitute for her own rather than in addition to it-often works so well
and results in relationships between mothers and adopted infants indistin­
guishable from those of mothers and offspring they gave birth to.
     Maternal programs are quite open-ended in primates, as compared to,
say, sheep. This distinction may seem an obvious point. Yet a failure to
acknowledge it led to a major misunderstanding in the interface where ani-

    Infant-Sharers
Fascination with babies is universal in primates . What differs between species
is the willingness of mothers to let anyone else hold her newborn. Invariably
other females come up to a new mothc1· to nuzzle or inspect the neonate.
Some try to take it from her. For the most pa1·t, however, mothers respond
possessh·cly, as if to say, "Look . . . maybe even touch . . . but you arc not to
take this baby away." Among most baboons and macaques-which belong to
the ccrcopithccine branch of the Old World monkeys, characterized by
ranked matrilineal clans-mothers arc anxious about loaning their babies,
and with good reason. Most mothers steadfastly refuse to. If a subordinate
female is forced to hand over a baby to a female from a more dominant matri­
line, the mother may not be able to get it back, with the result that the infant
stanes to death. 27
    Chimpanzee mothers have a special worry. These apes arc unusual among
primates insofar as they hunt, and mothers have to worry about the possibil­
ity of a meat-hungry chimp eating her newborn-a peculiar maternal con­
cern that may not fit the mental image most people have about these apes. It's
probably significant that chimps arc more carnivorous than most primates,
and also that they arc among the minority of primates in which mothers do
not necessarily remain to breed among close kin.
    Then there are the infant-sharers, monkey species in which females are
especially closely related and also have dominance hierarchies so relaxed that
mothers can afford to freely give up babies to their kin-heaven, if you arc an
eager young allomothcr, and very convenient for mothers. It is to these
infant-sharing monkeys that we need to look to get a clear picture of which of
all these baby-lusting females arc actually most motivated to get their hands
on babies-to hold and carry them- --and why.
    Even though a newborn monkey clings from birth to its mother's fur,
keeping it there requires constant minor adjustments, as anyone knows who
has tried to use their hands to get a job done while carrying something both
,·ulncrable and awkward. A mother ·who turns her baby over to a sitter is
freed to pluck and cat more mouthfuls of food per minute. What primatolo­
gists call "freedom to forage" is the payoff for maternal permissiveness. In
species characterized by infant sharing, babies grow faster. This is presumably
 J62               MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
because better-fed mothers can make more milk for them. Infant-sharing
                                                              28
mothers also breed at a faster rate, after shorter intervals.
    Invariably the most persistent allomothers, and also the allomothers who
keep the baby the longest once they get hold of it (if mothers will let them take
it), are young females who have never had an infant of their own and who­
as the anthropologist Jane Lancaster pointed out-have the most to gain
from "learning to mother." This is the equivalent age-sex group that in human
societies spends hours and hours playing with dolls. The species where moth­
ers arc most permissive about loaning out their babies-langurs, colobus
monkeys, and other "lcaf-caters"-belong to the colobine subfamily of the
Old World monkeys.
    The hanuman langur monkeys of India that I studied are classic infant­
sharers. Groups tend to be small on average, with only a single breeding
male . Females are as closely related as sisters or cousins. Unlike baboons and
other species with fixed female hierarchies, langurs have relatively fluid
female hierarchies that fluctuate through time, with young females rising in
rank about the time they start to breed and then declining in rank as they
grow old. 29 In these relaxed matrilineal groups, mothers freely farm out
babies to their kin.
    W ithin hours of birth, baby langurs are spirited away from their mothers.
They spend up to 50 percent of daylight hours passed from allomother to
allomother. The newer the baby, the more irresistible allomothers find it,
although the baby at the center of all this complains loudly at being taken
away from its mother's breast.
    I was a nulliparous female in my own right back when I studied infant­
sharing in wild langurs, and found the cries of the borrowed babies enor­
mously stressful because they made me want to intervene-which was not
possible. Allomothcrs occasionally treated infants roughly, pulling them by
one leg or, if they got bored with the baby and were trying to make it let go,
pressing its face to the ground. Yet in thousands of hours of observation, I
never once saw an allomother harm her charge. The younger and less experi­
enced an allomother was, the harder she tried to keep the baby happy, patting
it on the back, nuzzling its face, never pushing it off.
    More experienced females who have had several infants of their own
eagerly take the infant a few times, perhaps turning it upside down to inspect
its genitals, hut quickly lose interest. Besides the inexperienced youngsters,
                         I'ROM     HERE       TO    MATERNITY
Fig. 7. 6 A juvenile I augur monkey takes an infant from another allomother, a very pregnant
female on the verge of giving birth. Both are very motivated to take and carry babies. (San>h Blaffir
Hrd)'lAnrhro-Phoro)
the only females likely to keep an infant longer than five minutes arc very
pregnant females approaching term-probably primed to feel broody by the
same maternal cocktail that induces maternal behavior in expectant mice. 30
Adult male langurs, however, have no interest in carrying babies, and imma­
ture males account for only a tiny fraction (o. 2 percent) of attempts to take
babies. Playing at being a mother is something only future mothers are moti­
vated to do (which is different from saying males can't or won't caretake­
see chapter 9, "Three Men and a Baby").
     Since langur milk appears to be just as low-fat as the dilute milk of other
monkeys in species where babies spend all their time within reach of the nip­
ple, my guess is that consumers make up at night for time spent ofr their
mother's nipples during the day. 31 Allomothcring the langur way is one of
those win-win situations from which both over-burdened mothers and eager
allomothers benefit, with babies none the worse for it.

Fig. 7. 7 Newborn infants exercise a magnetic appeal. Young females who have never had an infant
of their own, along with wry pregnant females hormonally primed to mother, arc especially
mesmerized, and sometimes downright obnoxious in their efforts to get hold of one. This may be
one reason langur mothers seek secluded places to give birth. I crawled for seventy feet under
thick bushes to photograph this mother giving birth. By the time I found her, so had her group
mates. The group's alpha female (a temporary status) was \'ery pregnant at the time and desper­
ately eager to have a look. The new mother, unwilling to gh·e her neonate up yet, lay on top of
the neonate and crossed her paws (the newborn's drying umbilical cord can be seen just sticking
out from under the silver hairs on its mother's stomach). In the foreground, an older juvenile
female is also mightily interested, but, as langurs arc wont to do, bashfully looks away from the
neonatal object of her desires   while inching ever closer. (Sarah Bl'!!for Hr<!J·!.�nrhro-Phoro)
     Culture and Socialization
In some human societies, mothers pass babies around like some infant-sharing
primates do, though more often only the mother holds her newborn. This
degree of variation in the pattern of maternal care within the same species is
one respect in which humans differ from other primates. But there is another
even more important respect. Unlike other primates, women imagine ahead
of time what it will be like to give birth and to be a mother. Their expectations
are built not just on what they themselves have experienced, and from observ­
ing others and practicing with their babies, but from what others (especially
other women) tell them it should he like. Anyone who observed Prissy's panic
and heard Melanic's anguished screams in the ncar-death labor scenes from
the film of Gone With the Wind at an impressionable age is more likely to

Fig. 7 .SThis diagram of the size of the neonate's head (the black oval) relative to the pelvic outlet
in monkeys and apes illustrates why delivering babies is so much tougher for women compared
with other apes. Labor in a gorilla is short, on the order of twenty minutes, and enviably easy. By
contrast, human births take far longer, and range from easy to extraordinarily difficult. It took
sixty-four contractions (occurring an hour apart at first and then gradually occurring every two
to four minutes) over an eight-hour period to deliver my third baby, and all present regarded it as
an "easy" birth. For such ordeals, women can thank the engineering demands of a pelvis that
allows upright walking. Quite simply my baby's cranium was larger than the anterior-posterior
dimensions of my pelvic outlet, requiring my son's head to enter the outlet facing sideways. Evo­
lution of largcr brains around 1. _s- million years ago unquestionably played a role in this tortuous
process. In contrast to apes, but more like humans, monkeys also undergo a tight squeeze. It's
obvious that giving birth hurts; the parturient monkey strains and may yelp. But she docs not

assume she will need painkillers at parturition than someone whose expecta­
tions about childbirth were shaped by Pearl Buck's The Good Earth. The peas­
ant woman's baby slipped out and the mother went back to work in the rice
fields the same day.
     Even though nerve signals work the same way, something as obviously
biological as pain in childbirth is experienced differently depending on cul­
tural expectations. Women develop expectations not just about how they
should respond but about how they should experience their own sensations
and emotions. A human mother experiences particular emotions quite spe­
cific to her infant even before it is born, something I doubt other animals do.
 166               MOTHERS          AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    An Initial Reserve
In some cultures, like my own, the birth experience is seen as "labor." The
"work product" is the baby, whose successful arrival is supposed to-and
often does-evoke spontaneous joy. To this day the word that comes to mind
when I recall my own first birth is euphoric. My husband describes the
moment our first daughter was handed to him as the happiest in his life. Yet
Wenda Trevathan, an anthropologist who studies birth across cultures, was
surprised to learn how atypical this "immediate reaction of joy" actually is in
the context of general human experi ence.
    In many cultures a guarded maternal response is more typical, what Tre­
vathan describes as "a period of indifference while the woman recovers from
the exertion of delivery." Among the Machiguenga and other peoples of low­
land South America, the newborn is set aside after the midwife cuts the
umbilical cord, almost ignored, till the mother has been bathed. Only after
the mother begins to nurse the child, hours later, or perhaps the next day,
does the mother become concerned about the infant. 32
    In many cultures, formal acceptance of the infant as a new member of the
community is delayed, and only celebrated some time after birth. Expres­
sions of ebullience at birth would be regarded as unseemly, like tempting
fate. In others, emotions are put on hold until people can be assured all is
well. There is a matter-of-factness about giving birth. People simply do what
they need to do. There is also an awareness that this is a time of real danger,
spiritual as well as physical (see chapter 2 o).
    Traditionally, most anthropological fieldworkers were men. Rarely would
they be eligible to attend births. Remarkably few detailed and objective
accounts of births from different cultures are available. Brigitte Jordan pro­
vides one of the few detailed published accounts for Mayan-speaking people
                                              "
in Yucatan, where she noted that there was      no reaction. No smiles. No talk or
exclamations." This account is very similar to that recorded by psychiatrists
in a sample of mostly married, well-off and healthy British mothers. The psy­
chiatrists were struck by the seeming "indifference" of mothers holding their
babies for the first time, just after birth-particularly first-time mothers, 40
percent of whom reportedly felt no particular affection for their babies ini­
tially, compared with 25 percent of experienced mothers (who had given
birth before). Strong feelings of attachment to the baby emerged in the days
and weeks following birth. n
    Among other things, the Mayan bystanders were waiting for what West-
                    FROM      IIERE TO      MATERNITY
crncrs call "the afterbirth." \Vith no remedy a\·ailable against postpartum
hemon·haging, safe dcli,·ery of the placent<l is critical to a safe outcome.
Among the best predictors of whether a mother seems indiiTcrcnt or actively
pleased, suggests Trevathan, is how much social support she has.14
    A Shortage of "Fixed Action Patterns"
If only women started to scratch furiously in the dirt just prior to giving
birth! Or if after giving birth women felt an irresistible compulsion to lick
the newborn all O\'er its body, or cat the placenta like other apes do. 15 If only,
like dogs (whose wolf ancestors also reared their pups in nursery dens), we
cleaned up our infants' excrement hy eating it. If only mothers engaged in
such "fixed action patterns," their stereotyped responses would put to rest the
debate owr whether or not there is an innate component to maternal behav­
ior in humans. But we don't.
    Primatologist Kelly Stewart, one of the few people who has observed a
wild gorilla give birth, describes that mother's compulsion to cat the pla­
centa. "She left her newborn lying on the ground, picked up the placenta and
ate it with two hands, like pizza," Kelly told me. Only after that did the
mother turn her attention to the baby. 36
    But there are no "fixed action patterns" universally exhibited by new
mothers in Homo sapiens comparable to mammalian mothers licking babies
and biting off the amniotic sac. Humans respond to placentas very differently
and quite variably-disposing of them as waste, as we do, or (as in many
other cultures) burying them, either privately or with some public ritual.
Eating placentas seems to be more common among back-to-nature cults in
California than in any bona fide tribal society I know of.
    Apart from some Tibetan mothers, 37 postparturient women rarely lick
their babies. Instead, Bisayan women cleanse them with coconut oil and dust
newborns with powder; Mixtecans grease them with almond oil; Marshelles
with pure coconut oil; the ancient Greeks with olive oil; the Tewa bathe and
then rub babies with cornmeal; the Caraja apply red dye; the Tiwi of north
Australia cover neonates in charcoal; Hottentots rub newborns all over with
moist cow dung, followed by the juice of a fig tree, then smear them with
sheep fat and finally dust them with fine powdcr.18
    The myriad ways mothers respond to birth, and especially the broad range
of human customs surrounding birth (which depend on what specific sub­
stances, symbols, social rituals, and incantations they have available) makes it

also kept the body straight and prevented an infant from reverting to a fetal position, and thus
was regarded as part of the socialization process, transforming an infant from a more
animal-like creature into a civilized human-being who will walk upright. fl<· Noun-au N<\ bJ Gco�qcs Jc

impossible to come up with a list of species-typical universal traits that is any
more than obvious (the baby emerges from the birth canal covered with flu­
ids that need to be cleaned off somehow). The handful of behaviors that can
be reliably considered cross-cultural universals are all quite practical. They
include cleansing and immediate inspection of the baby, genitals first, fol­
lowed by touching the baby all over and perhaps long looks into the baby's
face. Even this inspection is skipped over hy some inexperienced young
mothers. In my own case, I felt a powerful urge to hold the baby close and
feel its skin and hody next to mine , and especially to smell the baby, which is

what many women do. But I cannot be sure my own urges were "universal,"
since according to those ethnographic accounts we do have, many mothers
delay holding the baby. 40
     Post partum Depression
Approximately half of all new mothers experience "postpartum blues" or
weepiness a few days after birth. A smaller portion (around 1 o to 1 5 percent
of women in Britain, North America, and Uganda, for example) go on to
experience serious depression several weeks after birth. 41 The most com-
                     FROM     HERE       TO   MATERNITY                       171
manly cited symptoms arc anxiety, sleep disturbances, concern for the baby,
depression, irritability, and hostility.
    That the arrival of a "bundle of joy" should have such counterintuitive
effects seems strange. Most people assume that being depressed right after
giving birth is not particularly adaptive . A few, however, go a step further and
ask why, then, arc postpartum "blues" so common?
    One popular psychoanalytic interpretation in the old days was that moth­
ers became depressed following birth due to their "sense of loss" at no longer
being pregnant. 42 (Remember, most psychoanalysts in those days had never
experienced the very memorable last week of pregnancy, the onset of which
can be pinpointed, as a friend once told me, to "when you can't stand it
another moment and burst into tears. Then you know you will give birth in
one week.")
    Few contemporary psychiatrists, and even fewer mothers, are persuaded
that women are anything other than relieved when pregnancy ends. Today,
there are three main explanations, none mutually exclusive, all evolutionary.
    As discussed above, there is considerable evidence for mammals that neu­
rochemical changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period evolved to
ensure proximity of mothers and infants. Hence, some medical experts have
come to see the new mother's depression as a pathological response to mod­
ern procedures that interfere with her following this natural mammalian pro­
gram of mother-infant proximity, or else depression is simply a by-product of
these changes, period.
    Detailed naturalistic observations of mothers with different amounts of
exposure to their babies might allow testing of this proposition. Unfortu­
nately, most information derives from routine medical exams. "Well, Mrs.
Jones, how are you feeling today?" followed by a weak, unconvincing reply:
"Fine, I guess . . ."-an interchange that provides far less information than
could be obtained by actually observing how many minutes of each hour Mrs.
Jones and her new baby are in contact, whether she breast-feeds, and how
often, compared with a control sample of cheerful moms.
    The second hypothesis, favored by evolutionary psychologist Stephen
Pinker and others, assumes that the postpartum depression is specifically
human in origin (rather than mammalian or primate). They trace it to a con­
flict between a mother who, in some earlier nomadic hunter-gatherer phase
of human evolution, would have chosen to invest no further in an infant if it
were defective or if she lacked a mate, and civilized circumstances, which
 1]2               MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
prevent such a mother from bailing out. Contemporary constraints include
both custom and stringent laws that make infanticide ill-advised or impossi­
ble. "The depression is most severe," Pinker writes, "in the circumstances that
lead mothers elsewhere in the world to commit infanticide."43
    The fact that depressed mothers were less affectionate with their babies,
and that half of them were depressed while pregnant, even before they
gave birth,44 are both consistent with Pinker's hypothesis. However, medi­
cal researchers counter by citing cases of women suffering postpartum
depression whose children are healthy, social circumstances good, father
present and willing to invest45-in short, mothers who do not obviously
seem to resemble that small fraction of hunter-gatherer mothers who would
have committed infanticide (the best estimates for nomadic African hunter­
gatherers like the !Kung are on the order of one in a hundred births,46 far
lower than the fraction of women who suffer from postpartum depression).
Furthermore, whereas most women who abandon or kill their own infants
tend to be young, women suffering postpartum depression and postpartum
psychoses seem to represent the average age of mothers generally. 47
    I have talked to women suffering postpartum depression. Often they are
mystified as to why they should feel so "sad" or "so angry," and quite certain
that they want to keep their babies. Why would a vestigial emotion that
applied to only a fraction of women (say, one in a hundred) in the evolution­
ary past apply to one in ten or more today?
    This brings me to the third of these evolutionary hypotheses, first pro­
posed by psychiatrist I. Mastrodiacomo and associates in Italy. Their explana­
tion relics on older mammalian responses, not necessarily rooted in the past
hundred thousand years of human evolution. It applies to a wider range of
mothers-those with "old" as well as "new" brains. According to this third
hypothesis, which might be termed the "vestigial lactational aggression"
hypothesis, postpartum depression is an endocrinological by-product or left­
over from an intense intolerance of others that was once adaptive among
mothers who might need to protect infants from either predators or conspe­
cific members of their same species. The root of her depression derives not
from the mother's suppressed desire to abandon her infant, hut from a fierce
compulsion to protect it that fills her with hostility toward others. The worse
off she is, or the more potentially threatened the mother feels, the more
defensive she should be. 48
    Such maternal emotions would not he nearly so inappropriate as feeling
                     FROM     HERE TO        MATERNITY                       173
infanticidal. Nevertheless, such hostile emotions arc rarely, in any human
culture, considered exemplary in a woman. In many cultures (especially
patriarchal ones) women arc taught that they should never feel or behave
aggressively, that they should cheerfully accommodate those around them.
Mothers (mammal, primate, or human) with minimal support, those who
felt the most stressed, would include among their numbers a tiny fraction
who might benefit from abandoning their babies, but many more who would
benefit from being able to protect them. Is "unexpressable" hostility being
registered as postpartum "depression"?
    All during pregnancy, a woman's anterior pituitary (which along with the
placenta is a major producer of prolactin) increases in size by about 40 to so
percent, preparing the mother's body for lactation. Prolactin may also be
implicated in responses that make her behave more defensively to protect her
young. Whether she decides to breast-feed or not, a woman r ight after birth
has high circulating levels of the same hormones that in other mammals are
implicated in "lactational aggression."
     Hormone profiles are consistent with the hypothesis that hostile feelings
in these recent mothers represent vestiges of lactational aggression. Prolactin
levels remain high at a time when estrogen and progesterone precipitously
drop. Women tested seven days postpartum had higher hostility ratings than
female hospital employees who were asked to volunteer to serve as controls.
When postpartum women were matched with patients known (for other rea­
sons) to ha,·e elevated prolactin levels (hyperprolactineia), the two groups
scored the same on hostility measures.49 Even women with no particular
depression undergo a postpartum decline in "positive feelings" toward hus­
bands in the couple of months immediately after birth, which seems very
odd-except as an artifact of lactational aggression. 50
    Little Steps to Maternity
All mammalian females have innate maternal responses, or "maternal
instincts." The question is, what do we mean by such terms? With fosB, we
learned just how important one gene-just one gene out of a total genome of
 1 oo,ooo or so-can be. One step at a time, something as simple and discrete
as a build-up of hormone receptors in the brain can determine whether a
particular signal from a pup fails to register, or becomes magnified into a net­
work of responses. Small nudges favoring distance by the mother, or affilia­
tion, can make an enormous difference in whether a bond between mother
 174               MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
and infant is forged . Many of these tiny differences can contribute to mater­
nal decisions of life-or-death significance for the newborn.
    But this unfolding of genetic instructions docs not conform to the com­
mon view of instinctive maternal devotion summed up in Fromm's epigraph,
love that is spontaneously expressed and "unconditional." It is not true that
women instinctively love their babies, in the sense that they automatically
nurture each baby born. Neither do other mammals-although when they do
care it is hard to explain their behavior as anything other than instinctive. In
other words, there is probably no mammal in which maternal commitment
docs not emerge piecemeal and chronically sensitive to external cues. Nur­
turing has to be teased out, reinforced, maintained. Nurturing itself needs to
be nurtured.
    Instead of old dichotomies about nature versus nurture, attention needs
to be focused on the complicated interactions among genes, tissue, glands,
past experiences, and environmental cues, including sensory cues provided
by infants themselves and by other individuals in the vicinity. Complex
behaviors like nurturing, especially when tied to even more complex emo­
tions like "love," are never either genetically predetermined or environmen­
tally produced.

The mother's gift of life can be measured in calories, minerals, opportunities
to invest in other children present and future, charged against her own con­
tinued survival in times of famine-or in teeth. In practical terms, the Ger­
man proverb Ein Kind, ein Zahn (One child, one tooth) comes closer to the
mark.
    This ol<i saying (which exists also in Danish, Russian, and Japanese) is con­
sistent with a recent study of Danish fraternal twins ages seventy-three years
and older: the more children a woman had, the fewer teeth she retained in
old age. Mothers of low social status lost about one tooth per child, while
those better off more nearly lost a tooth for every two children . 1
    Nine months, and there definitely is a charge. Pregnancy lasts over eight
months in gorillas, and closer to nine in orangutans and humans, making
the 7. 6-month gestation of chimps a bargain by comparison. Our hominoid
ancestresses topped off marathon pregnancies with a long, calcium-depleting
three to fiw years or more of lactation, which probably cost them more than
a tooth per child.
    Lactation, the most exorbitant phase of reproduction, lasts longer in pri­
mates than in any other mammal of comparable body size. Furthermore, a
primate mother must not only provision but also tote her infant. 2 If she suc­
cumbs in the process, her infant most likely dies with her. Thus mother and
infant had to cocvolve some way to space births that was calibrated to the
needs and condition of each. But how? Just what arc the implications of
                   MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
widely spaced, singleton births, and of the staggering maternal commitment
to each infant born that such scheduling permits?Why is maternal commit­
ment toward babies so much more contingent on circumstances in human
mothers than is the case in most other primates? I am convinced that part of
the answer lies in the past: not in the distant past, but in the last _5"o,ooo years
or so, a period for which we know almost nothing about child-rearing prac­
tices . Once again, comparative evidence (from other primates and people liv­
ing nomadic, foraging lives) offers the best hope for insights.
    Life in the Slow Lane
It's no wonder wild populations of apes have so much trouble bouncing back
after environmental disasters and in many areas of the world today hover on
the brink of extinction. Nor is it surprising that it took so long for the earliest
humans to amble out of Africa and only very, very gradually people the globe.
A mother ape's commitment to each infant born is part and parcel of having
evolved for "life in the slow lane."
    Seventy million years ago the earliest squirrel-like, scurrying ancestor of
these apes lived differently. She bore multiple young; and most likely she
stashed litters in nests the way the rare ruffed lemur (who typically has twins)
does today. Ruffed lemur females still sport three pairs of nipples as a mem­
ento of more prolific times. Under pressure to reproduce before something
ate them, primitive primates weaned fast-growing babies and bred again
quickly, compressing as many litters as possible into this short, busy, vulnera­
ble lifespan.
    T heir modern descendants, however, have evolved to breed at a more
deliberate pace. Birth rates, growth rates, and death rates among apes arc a
quarter to a half those found in other comparably sized mammals . In a life
lasting half a century, ape mothers rarely produce more than five widely
spaced offspring. Taking years to reach her mature body size, an ape breeds
late and spaces births four to eight years apart-although no other ape takes
quite so long to mature as immatures in humans typically do. 3
    Costly Offspring
Maternal investment begins at conception, extends through gestation and
lactation, and then, in. most mammals, terminates at weaning. For many,
weaning marks the end of further contact. A mother who meets her offspring
years later may fail to show any sign of recognition , may even attack, as if

the latter were a stranger-something dog
breeders know very well. But not so with
primates and mammals with prolonged
mother-olTspring relationships.
     A critical distinction between humans
and other animals, even other cooperative breeders, is the sheer duration and
extent of parental investment, along with the diverse forms parental invest­
ment takes. Weaning (to quote again from a song, this time a lullaby) is "only
the beginning." The provisioning of human young continues on and on, past
childhood into adolescence. 4 Behavioral ecologist Hillard Kaplan estimates
the pro,·isioning costs among South American foragers for one human from
birth to independence at 1 o to 13 million calories, not counting the food an
older child collects for himself. No foraging woman can meet such outlays by
herself. 5
     Long after weaning, human parents continue to invest in offspring; they
even help a grown daughter at her first birth. Parents and other kin help set
up progeny to breed, negotiate settlements of the property that customarily
changes hands when a son obtains a wife ("bride price"), or care for and pro­
vision grandchildren. In complex, stratified human societies, parents provide
substantial dowries, goods delivered to the groom's family by the bride's. The
present S 13 3 ,ooo plus cradle-to-college price tag of a middle-class North
American child merely represents the extreme end of a trajectory of greater
investment in offspring embarked upon by primates seventy million years
      6
ago.
     Unconditional Commitment of Mother Monkeys
In other mammals, a mother who bears a particularly large or costly litter can
be discriminating about which young she cares for. A mother hamster or
prairie dog, or even a domestic dog, will sometimes cope with a large litter
 1]8                 MOTHERS       AND     ALLOMOTHERS
by pruning, nudging aside the smallest or weakest pups so as to concentrate
on the strongest. But such pruning is not an option for a primate mother. She
gives birth to a single infant, born after an unusually long gestation. This baby
arrives with prioritizing built in. Its mother has already opted for quality over
quantity.
    Commitment of a monkey mother to her singleton, high-cost baby almost
never depends on attributes if the irifant itself, traits like weight, sex, birth
order, or physical conditions that affect survival prospects. Like all mammals,
primate mothers are primed by potent hormonal cocktails during pregnancy,
and at birth are exposed to the newborn's irresistibly infantile signals-its
shape, smell, sounds, and natal coat. The big difference between these pri­
mates and, say, prairie dogs is the extraordinarily low incidence among pri­
mates of maternal failure to attach to their babies. In fairness , however, it
must be noted that primate neonates themselves deserve some credit for this,
since they often clinch the deal by grasping hold of the mother's fur right
after birth. The neonate quite literally attaches to his mother.
The fact that humans are primates makes the degree of maternal ambivalence
found in our species seem all the more curious. Mother monkeys and apes
stand out among mammals for the extent to which they almost never dis­
criminate among offspring. Monkeys born blind or suffering from gross loco­
motor deficits like spastic cerebral palsy are assiduously cared for, so long as
they can initially cling. 7
    Being able to hold tight seems to be the only viability test newborn mon­
keys are subjected to. Pass that test and the mother soon after learns to recog­
nize and love the baby as her own. Thereafter she holds him even if the baby
becomes too weak to cling.
    Once emotionally attached, a monkey or ape mother will carry for days
the limp, even decomposing, body of an infant that has died. Ever so gently,
the mother lays the corpse on the ground while she feeds, fetching it when
she is ready to move on. Gradually the distance between the mother and the
object of false hopes extends. She moves farther and farther away to feed.
Elapsed time between visits to the now desiccated corpse grows longer until,
reluctantly, one day, with obvious ambivalence, the mother leaves behind the
flattened strip of fur.
                FAMILY     PLANNING         PRIMATE -STYLE                  179
    E,·en as she distances herself, a mother may continue to defend the
corpse. Once, years ago, before I knew better, I attempted to examine the
desiccated corpse of an infant Langur. I was mobbed, not only by the mother
and her female kin but also by the burly father. Langurs, Presbytis entellus
(named for the boxer Entellus lionized in the Aeneid), are in fact normally not
at all aggressive toward humans. On this occasion, however, it was as if the
ancient Trojans were battling to win back the body of Hector or some other
fallen comrade. Dropping my quarry and shielding my face, ignominious as
Paris, I beat my retreat.
    Such passionate maternal devotion in the service of a lost cause-for an
infant who has died-persists in the monkey mother's repertoire presumably
because comatose infants revive just often enough to make this energetically
costly allegiance to an immobile infant worthwhile in evolutionary terms.
Once in a blue moon, pale eyelids flicker open again.
    This unconditional commitment to her infant, irrespective of its sex or
other physical attributes, is, as we will see, one of the key differences
between monkey and ape mothers and human ones. Across human societies,
murder rates among men are always higher than those among women. Not
surprisingly, men tend to murder people they are not related to. But when
women cause someone else's death (through sins of omission as well as com­
mission) that person is most like1y to be her own newborn baby. 8 In this
respect, women are utterly different from other primates that, like us, pro­
duce one baby at a time.
    Infanticide is hardly unique to humans, and is widely documented among
primates, both human and nonhuman. But in other primates, the killer is
almost always an unrelated individual, never the mother. Even when nonhu­
man primate females are implicated in infanticide, mothers don't harm their
own infants, they   kill someone else's . Only under the direst circumstances
does a mother cease to care for her infant or actually abandon it.
    It is not that unusual for a mother monkey to treat her baby roughly, to
briefly drag it, or even punish it with a slap or threaten it with a toothy gri­
mace-especially when she is trying to wean. But no wild monkey or ape
mother has ever been observed to deliberately harm her own baby. 9
    Singleton versus Multiple Young
Docs this mean that primate mothers are by nature more nurturing than
other mammals? Does giving birth to one baby at a time somehow sharpen
 180                MOTHERS       AND     ALLOMOTHERS
maternal commitment? Were it not for the thick dossier implicating human
mothers in abandonment and outright infanticide, it would certainly ap­
pear so.
    Let's consider the evidence then for monkey and ape mothers that do give
birth to multiple young. Twins are rarer than in humans, and unless condi­
tions are very favorable, mothers have trouble rearing them. When moni­
tored, each twin gains weight more slowly and is weaned later than a
singleton baby. Often, survival of both twins is compromised, and cases of
twins provide several of the very few recorded instances when mother mon­
keys do appear to discriminate between infants based on viability.
    When a twin situation is artificially produced by a particularly zealous
mother adopting a second, "foster" infant in addition to her own, the mother's
own infant manages to spend more time on her breast. That infant also
grows faster than the fostered baby, presumably because the mother is able
to distinguish between them and discriminates in favor of her own. Similarly,
a wild gorilla mother who gave birth to twins abandoned the weaker of the
two.10
    The most telling evidence that multiple births is a factor in maternal aban­
donment comes from such unusual species as marmosets and tamarins, who
routinely give birth to multiple young. The commitment of these mothers to
their babies is far more conditional than that of other monkeys. Cotton-top
tamarins illustrate the point. These little South American monkeys are arche­
typal "colonizers," adapted to reproduce quickly when new foraging oppor­
tunities become available. They are among the several exceptions to the rule
that most primates arc slow breeders.
    Tamarin mothers routinely give birth to twins, occasionally to triplets,
and rely on the father and other group members to help rear them. When
faced with a shortage of allomaternal assistance, mothers reject one or more
babies, reducing their litter to a manageable size . If helpers are not on hand,
the majority of mothers refuse to undertake the daunting task of rearing mul­
tiple young. The babies are abandoned, usually within the first seventy-two
                    11
hours after birth .
    Can Monkeys Discriminate Between Infants?
Mother monkeys come close to psychologist Erich Fromm's ideal of a loving
mother: "unconditional" and "all-protective." But arc they unconditional in
their commitment because they lack the cognitive capacity to tell the differ-
                 FAMILY      PLANNING         PRIMATE -STYLE                    I 81
ence between infants, between a son and a daughter, a weak baby and a strong
one?
    This can't he the answer. Alloparents readily discriminate between one
baby and another based on age, sex, degree of relatedness, or physical condi­
tion, especially when abusing another female's infant. Other group members
may attack juveniles that behave in a strange or spastic way. Macaque alto­
mothers harass daughters born to low-ranking mothers but tolerate their
sons. Infanticidal male chimps, on the other hand, discriminate the other way,
killing male infants whose mother may have been impregnated by an out­
sider, while tolerating her daughters.
    There can be no doubt that nonhuman primate mothers have the capacity
to distinguish a healthy infant from a sick one, a son from a daughter. Yet there
is no evidence that mothers usc such information to discriminate among their
offspring. They never withhold care on the basis if physical attributes like sex,
age, 12 or poor health. Their willingness to care is not affected by infant quality.
In this respect, nonhuman primate mothers differ markedly from many
human ones. This is not to say that no monkey or ape ever abandons an off­
spring. Under extreme circumstances they do so. But abandonment depends
on the mother's condition or social situation, rather than attributes of the
infant itself. The circumstances are as revealing as they are unusual.
    When Monkey or Ape Mothers Abandon Babies
Cases of wi1d monkey mothers who abandon their babies almost always
im·olve mothers in very poor condition or faced with terrible predicaments.
A case in point would be a mother confronted with the arrival in her group of
a determinedly infanticidal male.
    A primate mother's worst nightmare is to have an infanticidal male per­
manently install himself in her group. Typically, mothers fight him off as best
they can, but time is on his side. Confronted with repeated attacks, some
mothers "give up." But the cases of special interest here involve mothers with
older, nearly weaned infants, infants who usually would be past the age when
infanticidal males would target them. (For example, most infants killed by
invading langur males are under six months old.) But some mothers find
themselves in the terrible predicament of having to decide either to remain in
their troop with a male who is attacking her infant or to leave the safe harbor
of the troop she is accustomed to.
    Confronted with infanticidal males, both gorilla and langur mothers have
 J82                MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
been known to take the extreme step of temporarily leaving their group.
Some take their infant and try to deposit it in the custody of the ousted father
or with the baby's brothers. In some cases, infants subject to such sudden
weaning and separation from their mother may survive. Among the many lia­
bilities, however, is that an infant old enough to survive on its ow n is also old
enough to find its way through the forest alone, back to its mother. In both
gorillas and langurs, abandoned youngsters were observed who eventually
caught up with their mothers again, only to be attacked by the new males
then accompanying them-suggesting that each mother "knew" what she was
doing when she deserted her baby "for its own good." In the langur case, the
little female was only wounded, not killed. The youngster (who was years
younger than the age of menarche) then did something amazing. She pre­
sented to the male and shuddered her head in the stereotypic pattern of an
estrous female sexually soliciting her attacker, as if to remind him "I'm too
old to kill. I' m someone you could mate with."13
    "Unconditional" versus "Contingent" Commitment
Giving birth as they do to one widely spaced infant at a time, a monkey
mother's marching song is understandable: "If it clings, I will carry it." But
what else would we expect from a mammal that breeds so slowly and is so
cautious about embarking on pregnancy, so discriminating about which preg­
nancies were continued? The majority of pregnancies, after all, terminate
before implantation of the embryo occurs. Considerable birth management
has already been exercised by the time each primate infant is horn.
    The singularity and costliness of each birth is what makes the contingent
nature of maternal commitment among human mothers so especially curi­
ous. Yet there is an enormous amount of evidence (reviewed below, in
chapters 1 2 through 14) that not all women do anything like commit uncon­
ditionally to each baby they bear. The fact that some human mothers give or
withhold care depending on the infant's sex , or some other specific attribute,
is unexpected and curious not because mammalian mothers arc uncondition­
ally nurturing (they arc not) but because other primates are.
    No other primate discriminates between offspring on the basis of infant
attributes. My question, then, is: What happened in the course of human evo­
lution and history to make mothers in our own species so much more dis­
criminating than other primates? No other primate, ever, scrutinizes an
infant for defects, or buries a newborn alive because it is horn the "wrong"
                FAMILY PLANNING            PRIMATE -STYLE
sex. Does our extremely contingent nature of maternal commitment mean
that human mothers arc born with less developed instincts, with blanker
slates in this regard than other primates?
    A Population in Check
Paleontologists, demographers, and anthropologists all agree that for most of
the Pleistocene, humans lived at extremely low population densities with an
infinitesimally slow rate of growth. Anthropologists studying modern genetic
di,·ersity in order to reconstruct ancient demographic history have hypothe­
sized that their effective breeding population never expanded much beyond
ten thousand people. 14 These early humans could have traversed vast dis­
tances without ever encountering as many new faces as one of us sees in an
evening at the movies .
    Demographers estimate for the beginning of the Paleolithic that it would
have takenfifty thousand years for a ragtag group of one hundred survivors to
multiply to ten thousand. Confronted with hard times, many small local pop­
ulations died out. Blessed with periods of abundance, others expanded, split,
and spread. Even so, the estimated doubling time was probably around once
every 1 s ,ooo years, contrasted with a human population currently doubling
every fifty. 15
    An astonishing fact from primate population genetics underscores how
newly fecund our species is. There is more variation in the genomes of vanish­
ing populations of East and West African chimpanzees than exists in all of
humanity put together. Why? Because all humans on earth today probably
descended from the same small population of hunter-gatherers last in the
same place roughly 1 oo,ooo years ago. After an exceedingly slow start, the
carpet of humanity covering the globe today was laid down over such a short
period that Homo sapiens as a species did not have time for the extensive local
evolution and microdifferentiation at a genetic level that characterized the
many different ancestral populations of chimpanzees.
    So how did our ancestors maintain their slow reproductive pace for so
long? What limited early hominid populations? And what changed?
    Explaining Slow Growth
The very fact that populations were so dispersed made it unlikely that
epidemics or warfare, which are essentially local phenomena, could have
sufficed to keep the lid on population growth over such long periods.
                   MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
Unsatisfied by Malthusian explanations-murder, pestilence, and famine­
the generation of evolutionary anthropologists that preceded my own (most
prominently J. B. Birdsell) postulated that hunter-gatherer parents kept fam­
ily sizes within manageable bounds by practicing infanticide. Darwin had
noted that "Barbarians find it difficult to support themselves and their chil­
dren, and it is a simple plan to kill their infants." Birdsell went further,
                                                                            16
hypothesizing infanticide rates as high as I' to )O percent of live births.
    By the I 97os, fieldworkers began to replace these guesses with real num­
bers. Infanticide rates as high as 40 percent could be documented, but pri­
marily in more settled and patriarchal societies with preferences for sons so
strong that they killed daughters, not in nomadic hunter-gatherers consid­
ered representative of Pleistocene foragers. In her classic demographic analy­
sis of !Kung San nomads, still making their living in an arduous old-fashioned
hunter-gatherer way, anthropological demographer Nancy Howell reported
only six cases of infanticide in )OO live births. Infanticide was culturally sanc­
tioned, even regarded as a duty under certain circumstances. But circum­
stances requiring infanticide-birth defects or a birth so ill-timed that it
would jeopardize survival chances for an older child-were uncommon. 17
    Practiced at such low rates, infanticide could not account for such slow
population growth. For one thing, infanticide right after birth (which !Kung
infanticide always was) unless practiced again and again is not an effective way
to reduce population growth, since a human (or ape) mother who loses a
neonate becomes pregnant and gives birth soon again, perhaps within the
year. Furthermore, birth intervals reported for hunters and gatherers were if
anything shorter than those in other hominoid apes among whom mothers
never killed, and very rarely abandoned, their own infants. Hence, although
infanticide was almost certainly practiced, it was a poor candidate to explain
slow growth of populations like the !Kung. Something else had to he responsi­
ble for the very low birth rates and slow population growth. What? The
answer resides in the ovaries and the lifestyles of foraging ape females, and can
be divided into three categories: delayed maturation; a long delay between
first menstruation and the point where a woman actually becomes fertile (a
period known as "adolescent subfertility"); and long intervals between births.
    Delayed Maturation and "Adolescent Subfertility"
By the standards of most mammalian life histories, all apes take a long time to
mature to breeding age. Humans, however, arc off the scale (see below, chap-
                 fAMILY      PLANNING        PRIMATE-STYLE
ter 1 1 ). \Vithin the age range possible for their species, however, individuals
mature at different times. In general, better-nourished human females reach
menarche sooner, conceh·e earlier, and reach full body size sooner. A chimp
in a producti\·e territory blessed with supportive and influential kin (Flo's
eldest daughter, Fili, comes to mind) reaches menarche as early as eight,
several years before other females in her community do. In the 197os, nutri­
tionist Rose Frisch confirmed nineteenth-century suspicions that women
resembled apes and other mammals in this rcspect.18
    \Vith reproductive fat beginning to accumulate, some of the fat cells
secrete the hormone leptin. Soon, every ninety minutes the girl's hypothala­
mus will release regular pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.19These
pulses are the critical event in puberty, stimulating the pituitary gland to
secrete hormones addressed to long-dormant ovarian follicles-follicle­
stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which essentially tell this egg­
incubating organ to switch on.
    But the first menstrual cycles in humans and other apes have a special
twist. Whether females mature early or late, cycling begins long before preg­
nancy is possible. In apes, this period of adolescent subfertility lasts anywhere
from six months to three years, protecting an adolescent who is sexually
active from conceiving.      In some species (chimpanzees and bonobos come to
                          20
mind), adolescent females are sexually very active indeed.
    A female chimpanzee, for example, may reach menarche at eight. But it
will be several years before her sexual swellings (as a result of rising estrogen
le,·els in the middle of her cycle) are full-sized, and grown males pay atten­
tion and mating begins in earnest. But even then, a female chimpanzee may
copulate on the order of 3, 6 oo times during successive subfertile cycles
before she conceives for the first time, around age fourteen, and gives birth.
                                                                                21
    An adolescent's sexual swellings are especially conspicuous. Young females
use them like "diplomatic passports" that permit safe passage through hostile
territories. This way the wandering female can check out competitors and
local resources in foreign communities while she decides where to eventually
settle to breed . In the meantime, young females are free to explore and to
continue growing.
    By fifteen, a chimpanzee female has already borne her first baby and
attained full body size. From then on, she is far more fertile than younger
females. Furthermore, because of her greater maturity and experience, an
infant born to such a mature female is more likely to survive. It is as if male
 J86                MOTHERS          AND   ALLOMOTHERS
chimps are programmed to know this and respond accordingly. Given a
choice between two sexually swollen females , male chimps invariably choose
the older one. 22 It is interesting to speculate why men in some societies differ
from other primates in this respect, placing so much emphasis on youth. One
reason, I suspect, is that these men are in a position to monopolize access to
their mate and to literally possess her long-term. The mate he acquires may
end up living in his social unit for a long time, whereas a male chimpanzee is
merely seeking to fertilize a female and have done. Even though males of
their respective species may have different criteria for sexual attractiveness,
women and female chimps are nevertheless characterized by the same pat­
tern of fertility, shaped like a lopsided bowler hat.
    Early adulthood is the time women are most fertile, their pregnancies
most likely to have a good outcome, and their infants most likely to survive.
For most women, fertility peaks between the early and mid-twenties,
although among some poorly nourished West African and Nepali groups peak
fertility is much later, around twenty-six to twenty-nine years. 23 Fertility is
lower and the probability of miscarriage higher among the very young and
very old. 24 After peaking in early adulthood, fertility declines with age, fall­
ing to zero at menopause, sometime in the forties for chimps and women in
most foraging societies, later for women in postindustrial societies-and
around thirty in a captive macaque.
Late menarche and adolescent subfertility protect a young female from a
dangerous reproductive enterprise unlikely to yield sur viving offspring. The
same stockpiled resources could be put to far better usc later, when offspring
would be more likely to be born healthy and to survive. The importance of
such delays may be even more critical for human mothers than other pri­
mates because conscious planning plays such an important role in our ability

Fig. 8. 2 At fourteen this !Kung girl is just reaching puberty. Under the harsh conditions of the
Kalahari, she is still several years away from menstruating for the first time. By contrast , a rich
diet and a far more sedentary lifestyle mean that girls in the United States mature more rapidly.
The majority reach menarche by age twelve and a half, four years earlier than this nomadic gath­
erer. Adolescent subfertility, not chastity, ensures that she will be nearly twenty before she gives
birth . (lrv DtlorelAnrhro-Pboto)

to cope. Yet faculties critical for emotional control and for organizing and
carrying through with plans of action arc still maturing at the same time
her ovaries are . This is why some psychiatrists refer to early reproductive
maturation as "starting a car engine without a skilled driver."25
    Since the Neolithic, and especially in the past several centuries, better­
nourished girls have begun to mature earlier, and are capable of conceiving
earlier than ever before in human existence-closer to twelve than twenty.
In the United States in I 996, a half-million babies were born to girls between
ages fifteen and nineteen, I I ,ooo to girls fourteen and under-the highest
                                                        26
rate of teenage births of any industrialized country.
    People refer to this as the "problem" of teenage pregnancy, yet it is more
nearly a problem of failed contraception, an undermining of evolved safe­
guards that under conditions more typical of human existence protected very
young girls from inopportune conceptions. Any adolescent girl living under
foraging conditions who found herself in the unusual situation of being
plump enough to trigger ovulation in her early teens would almost certainly
be in an unusually productive habitat. She also-and this is important­
would have to be surrounded by well-disposed adults helping to provision
her (see chapter I I). In modern societies, however, adolescents can be terri­
bly disadvantaged, lack all manner of social and economic support, yet still be
so hypernourishcd that they reach menarche at twelve and conceive by fif­
teen . The amount of fat a girl has on board has become a dangerously mislead­
ing signal telling this young mammal that it is a good time to go ahead and
reproduce, when it is anything but. In the United States today early childbear­
ing and large numbers of closely spaced births arc the two greatest risk fac­
tors for child abuse and infanticide. 27 I return to this topic in chapter 1 2.
The way the hypothalamus and the pituitary respond to signals secreted by
fat cells is another one of those clues suggesting that evolution did not end
with the Pleistocene, nor stop when radiation out of Africa got under way.
Depending on the geographic origin of her ancestors, different girls' thresh­
olds for responding to the hormones that trigger menarche arc set slightly
diffcre�tly. Selection pressures on her not-so-distant ancestors have become
encapsulated in her genome. Hence, age of menarche varies not only with a
                fAMILY      PLANNING        PRIMATE -STYLE
girl's immediate circumstances but also according to where he•· ancestors
came from.
    Even fed the same diet of high-fat, high-carbohydrate Big Mac equivalents,
daughters of mothers born in the warmer climes of southeastern Europe
reach menarche earlier on average than daughters whose ancestors came
from northwestern Etirope. Just why this is so (cold winters? taller bodies?
greater likelihood of famine?) is not known. Nevertheless, recent European
migrants to Australia, all currently living in the same environment, start to
menstruate at different ages depending on whether their mothers came from
southern or northern Europe-strong evidence that some genetic compo­
                                    28
nent influences age of menarche.
    Absent Fathers and Early Menarche
In all primates, menarche can be speeded up or slowed down by various fac­
tors. Primate females respond to social stress, mother's low status, or unpre­
dictable resources, by delaying puberty. Curiously, one of the first findings
about human mating systems to catch the attention of sociobiologists was an
apparent exception to this pattern. Girls growing up in households where the
father was absent reached menarche earlier on average than those with the
father present. 29
    Struck by this correlation, evolutionary-minded anthropologists Pat
Draper and Henry Harpending proposed that girls growing up in "father­
absent" households are conditioned to expect men to provide little and to be
unpredictable ("cads" was their memorable term, as opposed to more nur­
turing and reliable "dads"), and respond accordingly by pursuing alternative,
more promiscuous reproductive strategies. Having written off the likelihood
of being able to forge an enduring pair bond, the girl opts for a more oppor­
tunistic strategy aimed at short-term gains. 30
    In line with this model, girls growing up without fathers engage in sex
earlier, and with more different partners. Some researchers hypothesize that
sexual maturation might be speeded up by a higher level of social stress in the
home that "triggers an early increase in gonadal and adrenal hormones facili­
tating early sexual activity among girls." Essentially, then, early menarche is
assumed to be an effect produced by ecological and social circumstances,
including the daughter's perception of her mother's plight. lJ
    It is an intriguing hypothesis. In some circles it is already accepted as fact.
                    MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
It is, however, a hypothesis that makes primatologists uneasy, because the
underlying reproductive physiology is so "unprimatclike." "The less pre­
dictable the resource base, the greater the social stress-the earlier the
female matures?" a primatologist asks incredulously. Completely the opposite
is true for resource-deprived baboons and low-ranking female chimps. In
other primates, stressed females delay rather than speed up maturation.
    The main competing hypothesis is that the correlation is an artifact of
something else. This alternative hypothesis focuses on a girl's genetic inheri­
tance from a mother who matured early rather than some nonheritable
"maternal effect." If mothers who reach menarche earlier, engage in sex ear­
lier, and become pregnant at an earlier age, are, as a consequence of this
personal history, less likely to end up in a stable relationship, then their early­
maturing daughters would find themselves growing up in a household with­
out a father. This would make early menarche more nearly an incidental
correlate of absent fathers than an adaptation to cope with them. 32 At this
writing, the puzzle remains unresolved.
    When Primates Give Birth Young
No matter how or why she happened to conceive so young, there is a general
(and reasonable) perception that girls in their early teens make poor moth­
ers . Young mothers arc disproportionately represented among neglectful,
abandoning, or even infanticidal mothers in both police records for North
America and ethnographic accounts for tribal societies. 33
    It is difficult to tease apart complicating variables-heredity, the girl's
own childhood experiences, prenatal care, social support, marital status,
available resources. Is it really giving birth at an early age that produces inad­
equate mothering, or is it the correlation in our society between giving birth
early and low socioeconomic status?34 In monkeys, however, the correlation
between giving birth in adolescence and substandard caretaking is less com­
plicated.
    Like many an American girl who gives birth in her early teens, some
sedentary and unusually well-provisioned monkeys also breed early. Con­
sider the vervct monkeys kept by primatologist Lynn Fairbanks in a large
outdoor colony ncar Los Angeles. Fed ad libitum, hypcrnourishcd thrcc­
ycar-olds gave birth a year or more sooner than they would have in the mixed
African woodland-savanna habitats where the species evolved.
    To field primatologists, accustomed to the virtues of mother monkeys, the
               FAMILY      PLANNING          PRIMATE -STYLE
behavior of these "teenage" mothers came as a shock. Compared with physi­
cally mature ven·ets, these "young" mothers were negligent to a degree not
seen in the wild. Some failed even to pick their neonates up off the ground.
Once again, as with the twin-bearing tamarins, abandonment almost always
occurred within the first se,·enty-two hours (sec above, page 18o). It's as
though something critical for maternal responsiwness never quite clicked
on. Their infants died at twice the rate of infants born to full-sized mothers in
                                                  lS
the "prime" breeding years of early adulthood.
    It is meaningless to point out that such lapses in maternal solicitude arc
never reported in the wild, because vcrvets that young never conceive in the
wild. There is an obvious temptation in the case of the hyperfcrtile \'crvets to
compare the consequences of their artificial, provisioned lifestyle with the
plight of human teenagers. Settled living and plentiful food have removed
constraints on fertility that for tens of millions of years protected anthropoid
primates from giving birth at such young ages.
    From a purely biological perspective, whenever chastity among teenagers
is an unrealistic expectation, providing them with birth control can be
viewed as a reasonable way to compensate for recent and drastic transforma­
tions in the circumstances of human existence--rather like pressurizing the
cabin for people flying on airplanes, to compensate for hurtling them through
an environment they were never adapted to. If a primatologist instead of a
politician were president, it's likely that Joycelyn Elders, ex-Surgeon Gen­
eral of the United States, would have been given a medal rather than fired.
The immediate impetus for the surgeon general's dismissal was her public
comments to the effect that sex education and alternative outlets for libido
(such as masturbation) would be preferable to early, unprotected intercourse
by teenage girls who are fertile at the unprecedented age of thirteen.
    Extra Support at First Birth
For any primate, first birth is an especially vulnerable time. A wide range of
adaptations help a young female to negotiate it. Delayed maturation and ado­
lescent subfertility arc only part of the story; there arc also patterns of social
behavior that provide extra support to first-time mothers. Among the best­
documented such pattern is the one found among matrilineally organized
societies of monkeys where mothers help to ensure that daughters arc better
fed, and buffered from attacks at just the point in life when they begin to
reproduce.
                    MOTHERS          AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    Few females subscribe to a social etiquette more exquisitely subtle,
orderly, or predictable than Old World cercopithecine monkeys. As each
female baboon, macaque, or vervet matures, she develops a set of status
expectations about who belongs where. Cercopithecine societies are com­
posed of ranked matrilineal clans, with each clan in turn organized into a
rigid female hierarchy. It is mothers and grandmothers who shape it, by
perpetually monitoring the competition. Matrilineal clans stick together,
rallying to suppress or exclude social-climbing daughters of lower-ranking
lineages, while orchestrating advantageous social positions for their own, ex­
ercising all the tribal "discipline of a small society," as Edith W harton termed
the social hierarchies produced by society matrons in early-twentieth­
century New York.
    The two rules that prevail in cercopithecine societies are: (1) daughters fit
into the female social hierarchy just under their mothers; and (2) if there is
more than one daughter, the younger, just about the time she matures and
peaks in her reproductive potential, rises in rank above her older sister. But
given that she is smaller, younger, and weighs less , how? The younger sister
rises above her older sister with the help of an indomitable ally who ranks
above both of them-their mother. 36
    As her younger daughter approaches breeding age, the baboon or
macaque mother takes her younger daughter's side in confrontations with her
bigger, heavier, previously dominant older sister. The likeliest explanation for
this seemingly whimsical maternal preference is that she boosts her younger
daughter's fortunes at a critical juncture. 37
    Worlds away, hunter-gatherer girls giving birth for the first time act as if
they, too, feel the need for special support . Young couples in nomadic free­
form societies like the !Kung could live almost anywhere with anyone they
chose. But the most common pattern is for the new couple to remain near
the girl's parents till after the birth of her first child. 38
    A man who catches the fancy of a girl, and persuades her (or her family) to
have him, typically settles for a time near her folks. If the girl has not yet
begun to menstruate, sex may be postponed . Meat provided to the bride's
family constitutes a form of payment for reproductive rights to the daughter
by the prospective son-in-law.
    It is a way of life that passed out of favor with the Neolithic. In most pas­
toralist and agricultural societies, the bride decamps to go live with her hus-
                I'AMILY     t>LANNING        I'Rll\tATE -STYLE
band's family at marriage. But among foraging people, living as our ancestors
most likely did (that is, those hunter-gatherers who did not t·cly on boats or
hot·scs), daughters arc about as likely to stay ncar kin when they first marry as
they at·c to lea\·e. Anthropologists Kim Hill and Magdalena Hurtado report
that of twenty-one young foraging women among the Ache women of
Paraguay, sixteen continued to hang their hammocks within an easy holler of
their parents-at least for her first marriage (the average number of mar­
riages in this society is ten). 19
    This means that a young woman pregnant for the first time enjoys the sup­
port of kin at a time that will prove critical for her continued survival as well
as for her lifetime reproductive success. Furthermore, if the marriage does
not work out, as is common, parents arc on hand to support her.
A curious reminder of how adaptive it once was for a pregnant woman to be
ncar kin when pregnant persists in a modern woman's sense of smell. As has
been experimentally demonstrated for other mammals, ovulating women
prefer the scent of males who have genetically produced immunological
attributes (or, "major histocompatibility complexes")        different from their
own . Presumably this is to decrease the chances that a woman will mate with
close kin. Mice manage to avoid incestuous matings this way, by sniffing the
male's urine. Women use body odors instead. They can distinguish between
different men's smelly T-shirts, and rank them as either "attractive" or "unat­
tractive." Instead of preferring alien smells, very different from their own,
however, women taking birth control pills that simulate pregnancy exhibit
the re,·erse preference: they prifer the smell of those with immune systems
genetically most similar to their own, men most likely to be brothers or even
their father. 40 Perhaps women whose hodies have hecn artificially induced to
simulate pregnancy subconsciously gravitate toward kin.
    "Got Milk?"
Once a woman is mature and bears a child, what maintains the characteristi­
cally long three-to-five-year birth spacing typical of hunter -gatherers? Speci­
fications for a foraging woman's ideal birth-spacing mechanism would
include:
 194               MOTHERS          AND     ALLOMOTHERS
     1. the mother's nutritional condition;
    2.  her workload;
    3· how much milk any infant currently suckling still needs; and
    4· whether environmental conditions (especially resource availability)
        seem to be getting better or worse.
These are exacting specifications. Amazingly, the "ecology" of a woman's
ovaries takes into account all four.
    In the eighteenth century, some women, among them Mary Woll­
stonecraft (an early advocate of women's rights), were well aware that if
mothers would only breast-feed, "there would be such an interval between
the birth of each child, that we should seldom see a houseful of babes.'>41
    The understanding that nursing delays the next conception emerges in the
diaries of some aristocratic women of this period who deliberately contrived
to switch from wet nurses to breast-feeding so as to delay becoming pregnant
again.42 So far as medical science was concerned, however, breast-feeding
continued to be viewed as a notoriously unreliable form of birth control. The
"breast connection" was long dismissed as an old wives' tale.
    Not until the 1 97os did scientists appreciate that breast-feeding was the
foundation of family planning in primates, including people in traditional
societies. The "puzzle" of long birth intervals among hunter-gatherers was
officially solved when anthropologists studying the !Kung recognized just
how ciften babies were sucking on their mother's nipples. Mel Konner and
Carol Worthman reported that babies who were carried everywhere by their
mothers nursed several times an hour during daytime and slept with their
mothers, nursing on and off through the night. Konner and Worthman
demonstrated that frequent stimulation of the nipples was associated with
specific hormonal responses in foraging mothers.
    Right after birth, a rapid rise in circulating levels of prolactin signals onset
of milk production. Thereafter, each time the baby's mouth closes around a
nipple, stimulation from the baby's sucking signals the hypothalamus. This
small region at the base of the brain, in turn, lowers secretion of dopamine,
which triggers the anterior pituitary (a small gland ncar the hypothalamus) to
pump out more prolactin. Continued tugging on the nipple causes prolactin
levels to spike higher, increasing fifteen-fold above prenursing levels before
returning to the base level in about three hours-unless the baby sucks again.
                FAMILY      PLANNING         PRIMATE -STYLE
In women whose infants nurse frequently, pr-olactin levels remain continually
elevated. T hese high prolactin levels arc correlated with some as yet unknown
function that suppresses ovulation. Whatever it is, this thermostat is set at
night (sec discussion of melatonin and body rhythms above, in chapter ) ) .
    Sucking on one nipple, perhaps kneading and pulling on the other with its
fingers, the infant docs its baby-best to stimulate prolactin levels. From the
perspective of an infant strh·ing to survive, high prolactin levels not only sus­
tain lactation, they help hold at bay the conception of a new sibling, whose
impending arrival ·would encourage the mother to wean at once the babe at
breast. So far as the mother is concerned, the link between intensity of suck­
ling and postpartum infertility prevents an organism already burdened by
metabolizing for two from being saddled with another pregnancy and the
even more daunting task of metabolizing for three. 43
    Environmentally Sensitive Feedback Loops
Fashion-conscious readers of Harper's Bazaar who are also interested in avoid­
ing conception may have noticed an interesting new product being advertised
in its pages: a high-powered mini-microscope that allows the user to detect
changes in her saliva that are indicative of cycle state. To say that this snazzy
assay of steroid levels in saliva is an improvement over the rhythm method is
to put it mildly. Instead of groping groggily for her thermometer, wrestling
with doubts about whether the slight dip in her early A.M. temperature means
she is about to ovulate, or getting over being sick, smart women can "Simply
anoint the lipstick-size scope's reusable slide with a thin layer of saliva and
examine it through lens.'>44
    Celebratory bubbles form in nonfertile times, when it is safe (so far as
contraception is concerned) to have unprotected sex. During fertile times,
straight lines with cross-hatching will appear. T he dissemination of knowl­
edge that led to this gadget ("used by European women for decades" and only
S 3 9. 9 5) provided an even bigger windfall for anthropologists studying the
ecology of the onries.
    No longer faced with the need to persuade women to volunteer to have
their veins jabbed for a blood sample, Harvard University's Peter Ellison and
his coworkers fanned out around the world with stopwatches, notebooks,
and small glass vials. Trekking to pygmies living deep in the forests of Zaire,
to highland tribes in Papua New Guinea, to peasants in the Himalayas of
                   MOTHERS       AND     ALLOMOTHERS
Nepal and the Andes of South America, or merely ringing the doorbells of
housewives in Eastern Europe and Massachusetts, anthropologists observed
how often mothers suckled their babies, noted how much exercise the moth­
ers got, how much energy they had to expend to do their work, and then
requested them to please spit here, into this vial.
    Ellison and company were helping to unravel an incredibly complicated
system of interconnected, environmentally sensitive feedback loops involv­
ing the hypothalamus, pituitary, and the ovaries (technically referred to as
the "hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis"). T he reason breast-feeding
turns out to be so quirky and unreliable as a means of birth control is
precisely because this dynamic system is so keenly responsive to maternal
condition. 45
    On average, eighty minutes of suckling a day spread over a minimum of
six bouts should suppress menstrual cycling for eighteen months. 46 But it
takes more suckling to suppress ovulation if the mother is sedentary, less if
she has to walk long distances carrying heavy loads, or if she is jogging ten
miles a day. A professional ballerina, accustomed to grueling workouts,
would have been unlikely to conceive in the first place. Exercise notwith­
standing, the direct cue for how close to nutritional independence the
mother's baby is will be how hard or how often the baby sucks. But frequency
of suckling can be affected by the mother's work schedule, how far she has to
commute, and whether she carries the infant with her or leaves him behind.
(Of course, when a mother uses a breast pump, her body goes by how fre­
quently she expresses milk, not by the infant's feeding schedule.) When there
is no suitable substitute for milk, no safe water, or no safe place apart from
the mother's breast for the baby to be, then weaning must of necessity occur
late. A mother who neither breast-feeds nor works out may begin menstruat­
ing again as soon as two months after giving birth. However, women nutri­
tionally depleted by either recent food shortages or from breast-feeding her
last baby may cycle without necessarily ovulating.
    To many women, it is scarcely news that nutritional depletion makes them
less fertile. As one pygmy woman living in the lturi Forest of Zaire confided
to Ellison, "Hunger times arc not birth times."+7 Elsewhere in Africa, among
agro-pastoralists like the Kipsigis of Kenya, families seeking wives for sons
pay higher "bride-wealth" for young women who are plump and who reach
menarche earlier because, hypothesizes anthropologist Monique Borgerhoff
Mulder, the Kipsigis recognize that plump wives arc the most fertile.

   Back-Load Model
Like a modern working mother agonizing over when to go hack to work, o1·
whether or not to leave he•· hahy at the nearby daycare center, whose stall she
docs not quite trust, mothers have always found themselves calculating
whether it's safe to leave baby w ith an allomother. Can she return to camp in
time to suckle it? How hungry or dehydrated will it be? If she takes the child
with her foraging, will she be able to carry back enough food to make the
arduous trek worthwhile? Most such choices in the Pleistocene, however,
were c\·cn harsher. The baby of a mother who miscalculated the time to wean
probably died.
   Some environments were safer than others. Anthropologist Nick Blurton­
Janes and others have called attention to the harshness of the climate in a
desert locale like the K alahari, the ease with which a wandering child might
become lost in the vast, featureless flatlands; the sheer distances involved. A
gathering woman could not but take her infant with her. Yet she also paid
dearly when she did.
   Women frequently had to travel to distant groves of mongongo trees to
collect protein-rich nuts that arc a staple food in the !Kung diet. The trip
could be daunting, a dehydrating six miles each way. Given small group sizes,
even if another woman in her band was lactating, this woman might not be
willing to volunteer as a wet nurse, or might have to leave camp herself.
   The availability of palatable, alternative foods had to be factored in to age
of weaning. Infants born into worlds without safe water or soft, easily
digestible foods for weaning had to wait. Instead of Gerber's baby food,
babies made do on milk and insect grubs or fibrous vegetables masticated in
their mother's mouth, or, like lucky Ache weanlings, sucked on armadillo fat.
For a foraging mother to remain in close enough proximity to nurse could
require carrying babies-plus supplies and gathered provender- back­
breaking distances. Birth of another baby too soon could prove disastrous.
Hence Blurton Jones proposed that, in fact, far from limiting population
growth, endocrinological feedback loops that spaced babies at long intervals
actually worked to ensure that mothers replaced themselves, by optimizina
the survival of such infants as they did produce. Babies born at shorter inter­
vals might destabilize a mother's precarious juggling, contributing to her
demise and/or their own. W hen tested against data for the !Kung, the "back­
load hypothesis" held fairly well. 48

warns a !Kung proverb. This woman in the last months of pregnancy returns to camp with her
four-year-old son riding on her shoulders. Her leather sling, or kaross, permits her to carry nuts
or gathered food weighing twenty-fi\·e pounds or more, together with another five pounds of
personal possessions and water for the trip in an ostrich egg canteen, and her child, who weighs
almost thirty pounds. A child this age would already have been carried hy his mother some 4, 900
miles. (/l.ich•rJ 8./.ecl:lnthro·Photo)
out our understanding of Pleistocene lifestyles, it is important to remember
that the K alahari was just one of many possible permutations for hunter­
gatherers. Far to the north of Botswana , in the rock-strewn hillsides of Tanza­
nia, Hadza foragers collect all the tubers and baohah pods they need without
having to travel more than two miles from camp. Mothers arc rarely gone
longer than an hour (average travel time is twenty-five minutes). Infants arc
left behind at a much younger age (closer to age two than tour, as is charac­
teristic among the ! Kung), oft<.'n with subadult caretakers. Because they have
the option to leave babies with an allomothcr, Hadza mothers can produce
infants after shorter intervals than ! Kung mothers without compromising
               I' A 1\1 I I. Y I' I. A N N I N G I' R I M A T E - S T Y L E   '99
infant survival. As a consequence, the Hadza population is growing by 1 per·­
cent a year rather than holding steady. Similarly, abundant game in the South
American forests, where Ache foragers live, means more protein and fat for
women, birth intervals even shorter than among the Hadza, and higher popu­
lation growth rates. The "sleeper" here, the nonohvious hut very important
determiner of population regulation, is the little infant, whose suckling
transforms ecological differences into demographic ones. 49
    Division of Labor
\Vith the adoption of slings, like the leather kaross !Kung women still usc,
mothers could transport both infants and quantities of gathered food. The
technology of such carryalls is so unassuming that it is all too easy to overlook
the significance of this early technological revolution. It was the beginning­
perhaps as early as 5o,ooo years ago-of an economically significant division
of labor based on sharing.
    A rudimentary chimpanzee-style division of labor whereby males ob­
tained meat from hunting while females specialized in vegetable foods and
small prey items has characterized hominoids for more than five million
years. But with mothers' capacity to carry provender in addition to babies, they
would have had stores of food to share. The new division of labor meant that
men could go hunting confident in the knowledge that if they failed, women
would have sufficient gathered food back at camp to tide everyone over.
Anthropologist Jane Lancaster notes that new technologies for carrying
babies and also for obtaining food more efficiently (spears and sharpened dig­
ging sticks) meant that mothers who were better fed could give birth after
shorter intervals. Improved efficiency in food-getting contributed to shorter
birth intervals, and to the expanding human populations that were edging
their wav.I
            out of Africa. 50
    The Real Neolithic Revolutions
As the modern world closed in, bringing outsiders to once remote locales to
claim land once freely used by peoples like the !Kung, the last vestiges of
Pleistocene lifestyles came to a standstill. Former hunters and gatherers
spent more and more time in one place. Many kept livestock, or a garden, or
relied on handouts, or otherwise traded the freedom (and the uncertainty) of
a nomadic life for greater security. In the case of the !Kung, former foragers

tances carrying several offspring, or food plus offspring. These innovations left no trace in the
fossil record. The balancing baskets like these used by this Japanese mother arc still widely
employed. (Courtc�y '!}AnJy McCarrhJ·)
indentured themselves to Herrero pastoralists in exchange for milk. Instead
of making long treks to find food, carrying dependent children with them,
women stayed close to home sites.
     Whenever people cease wandering, intervals between births grow
shorter. For ethnographer Richard Lee, observing the transformation of the
!Kung San was like fast-forwarding through the Neolithic transformation of
early humans.
    "This sudden embarrassment of riches in terms of births," he noted, "is
already imposing hardships on !Kung mothers and children alike, a degree of
                 FAMILY       PLANNING         PRIMATE -STYLE                 201
stress that n:-,·eals the existence of a third system interlocked with production
and reproduction-a system I will call the emotional economy of the San."
The Neolithic revolution did not so much mean a radical overhaul in an ceo­
nomic sense; what was radically diflcrcnt was the abrupt arrival of the next
infant.
    No one had to bear the brunt of these changes more acutely than the
infants themselves. For a child in a village weaned after just a year and a half,
"The effects arc striking," wrote Lee.
    The most miserable kids I have seen among the ! Kung are some of the
     1 .5- to 2-year-old youngsters with younger siblings on the way. Their
    misery begins at weaning and continues to the birth of the sibling 6 to 8
    months later and beyond. The mother, for her part, has not only a
    demanding newborn to care for but the constant intrusions of an
    angry, sullen 2-year-old. A grandmother or aunt may do her best to
    feed and cheer up the older child and to give the overworked mother
    some relief, but it is clear to the observer that something is out of
    kilter.
The scene contrasted markedly with Lee's own earlier descriptions of loving,
infinitely tolerant !Kung mothers attending deftly to the cooing and crying of
each infant born. Gradual transitions from foraging to settled living-what
some refer to as the Neolithic revolution-were experienced by the infants
as a series of neonatal crises. 51
The prelude to the Neolithic was long and slow, dating back a million years or
more. People gradually became already more efficient at extracting food,
using sticks to dig tubers, traps or nets to catch fish and game. Furthermore,
as I will discuss in chapter 1 1 , a new type of allomother became available,
helping to provision offspring and making it possible for mothers to wean
children sooner and space births more closely. Some early humans, especially
those living in rich riparian or lakeside habitats, would not have needed to
forage quite so widely. As new food sources became available, and as people
spent more time in fewer places, birth intervals shortened and populations
began to grow.
202                 MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    Later, with the introduction of agriculture, these effects were greatly
magnified. By 1 1 ,soo years ago in central China, by 1 o,ooo years ago in the
Middle East, Mexico, and parts of highland South America, and closer tofifiy
years ago among such remnant foragers as the Ache and the ! Kung, lifestyles
changed completely. Foragers lingered in a few locales, literally putting down
roots, depending more and more on cultivated strains of wild rice, emmer,
einkorn, oats, barley, wheat, millet, or, in the New World, squash and
maize. 52 Woman the forager adjusted to the more sedentary routine of
woman the grinder. The availability of ground grain, and fired pottery to
cook it in, meant gruel was available year-round as a weaning food, so that
infants could he weaned as early as around six months and still survive. 53
    Population after population, independently, each according to its own
schedule, traded the freedom of a nomadic lifestyle for short-term security. 54
The long-term costs could be measured in the classic combination of higher
birth rates coupled with higher rates of infant mortality in the face of recur­
rent famines, epidemics, and war.
    For humans, the long birth intervals typical of chimpanzees and other apes
grew shorter. 55 Human infants were, if anything, more costly than those of
other apes, yet these slow-maturing, big-brained "ape" babies were arriving as
often as every two years or less. Large-bodied ape babies were being horn at
monkey-like inter vals. In areas where food was plentiful, selection actually
once again favored multiple births. In parts of the world where famines were
rare, the incidence of twinning increased.
    Scientists at the University ofTurku in Finland have shown that women
living on islands, with plentiful and constant supplies of fish, had higher rates
of twinning than women on the mainland. Island mothers who gave birth to
twins had a higher lifetime reproductive success, hut the same was not true
on the mainland, perhaps because crop failures and recurrent famines meant
that both twins and the mothers who bore them were more likely to die. 56
Indeed, in parts of the world where food has traditionally been less plentiful,
the only twins ever born arc identical twins. Such twins represent an accident
of early cell division rather than an inherited tendency toward multiple ovu­
lations.
    Replacing Singleton Births with Clutches
Long birth intervals were a staple feature of the coevolution between ape
mothers and their infants. However, over tens or even hundreds of thousands

hours on their knees grinding domestic cereals against a stone base, much as this Central African
 Remba mother is doing. While a mother is occupied by this daily grind, her baby might be held by
 an allomother, cradled nearby, or wrapped on to her mother's back using a sling arrangement

of years, hominid mothers were beginning to produce infants after shorter
intervals. Like the island-living Finns, some mothers were even reproduc­
tively favored for producing two at a time. Increasingly, periods of heavy
im·estment in successive infants overlapped, creating the functional equiva­
lent of litters (or the asynchronous hatching of broods found in some birds).
     At some point in human evolution, ape mothers with reproductive physi­
ologies and temperaments adapted to rearing singleton young found them­
selves simultaneously nurturing several young of different ages. Multiple
dependents became the "facts on the ground" that mothers had to adjust to
and eventually even adapt to.
     What humans, ruffed lemurs, and a handful of cooperatively breeding
monkeys like tamarins have in common with many birds is that, unlike other
apes, they live in families where mothers simultaneously care for multiple
young. Closer birth spacing over the course of human evolution exacerbated
dilemmas confronted by mothers who must then decide how to allocate

resources among dependent young with competing needs. These pressures
increased as the Neolithic brought about an unprecedented level of fertility,
but at a potential cost to particular infants who may not have been just what
(in terms of sex or other attributes) or been born when the stork ordered.
    A mother's genes would continue to be represented in the population or
disappear, depending on her ability to assess which offspring would best
translate her investment into long-term reproductive success, and on how
much assistance she managed to elicit from fathers and alloparents. I turn
now to the means by which mothers sought such help. First on the list: how
to elicit help from males in caring for infants.

              other-infant relations arc particularly intimate and long-lasting
              in primates.Great Ape mothers carry their infants wherever they
              go. Fathers, by comparison, arc rarely in direct contact with
babies.Even when, as is often the case in humans, men help provision the
mother, one-on-one care of infants by the father is unusual.Obser ving this,
the young George Eliot pondered the question of "a class of sensations and
emotions-the maternal ones-which must remain unknown to man . ."1           .   .
Later she changed her mind. Like Darwin puzzling over a capon he saw
brooding eggs, Eliot became fascinated by the possibility that males could
express the tenderness and compassion we normally associate with mothers.
    How, she w ondered, would "a lone man ...manage with a two-year-old
child ....   "What would happen, the novelist asked, if a motherless two-year­
old toddled through a blizzard and ended up at the door of a lonely man? She
titled her thought experiment Silas Marner, a novel that is still required read­
ing for English majors.In it, Eliot intuited what primatologists have since
documented. Care is most readily elicited from a male primate under three
conditions:
     1. long-standing familiarity with the immature;
    2.  the nearby infant is urgently in need of rescue; and, especially
    3· the male has a relationship with the mother.
    In Silas Marner's case, solicitude was elicited by little Effie's obvious need,
combined with a perception of kinship (Eliot tells us Marner identified the
golden-haired orphan with his long-lost "little sister"). Once triggered,
Marner's tenderness came naturally as he lifted the toddler and she

     of inarticulate cries with "mammy" by which little children express the
     bewilderment of waking. Silas pressed it to him, and almost uncon­

I know of no better human case history for exploring what Darwin termed
                          "
the "latent instincts for nurturing that lurk "even in brain of male."
     What docs it take to get a man to care for infants? And-turning to a
question much on the minds of mothers today-why don't fathers help
more? I'll first explain the immediate, or proximate, reasons why, in general,
primate mothers hold ·babies more than fathers do, then turn to the ultimate
causes for why male pr imates arc not more inclined to care for infants.
                        THREE      MEN    AND     A   BABY
   In all creatures where fertilization takes place inside the mother many
weeks or months before the infant is bon1, males cannot be certain of pater­
nity. A male's best clue to whether or not he is the father will be whether he
had sexual relations with the mother, and if so, their timing, and their fre­
quency. Most female primates have evolved to mate over a period of day s,
and (when feasible) with a range of male partners. There arc few species in
the order Primates in which males can be certain of paternity.
   This evolutionary history can still be detected in the patterning of sexual
behavior in women today, and in the psyches of men who arc obsessed with
the chastity of their mates. No matter that females did not evolve a flexible
and asserth·e sexuality in a vacuum. (It was an essential tactic for ensuring
well-being of their infants that would scarcely have been necessary if females
could choose an acceptable partner and count on him.) Given the situation as
we find it, females mate with more than one male. This leaves males little
choice. They must mate with as many females as they can, or else find them­
selves at a relative disadvantage vis-a-vis their rivals' efforts to transmit their
own genes to the next generation. Like mothers, males make tradeoffs of
their own. Males must choose between parenting offspring they may have
sired, and seeking to mate with additional females and possibly siring more.
Often such tradeoffs (along with uncertain paternity ) make it disadvanta­
geous for males to respond to the magic of infantile signals with the same
alacrity that mothers do. Mother Nature has set male thresholds for respond­
ing high. Yet it is not the case (as an egg-sitting capon led Darwin to suspect)
that males never care for infants. "Instincts" to care slumber in the hearts of
primate males, including men. Under what circumstances arc they activated?
    Godfather Gorillas
Far stranger transformations than Silas Marner's abound in the natural his­
tory of other primates. Binti Jua, the mother gorilla who rescued the little
boy at the Chicago Zoo, got all the press, but a decade earlier another little
boy on the Isle of Jersey fell onto the floor of the gorilla enclosure at the zoo
there. That time the simian good Samaritan was a silverback male named
Jambo, who stroked the boy's back and kept other apes away. 3
    Primatological lore is rich in anecdotes about aloof males transformed
into instant heroes by endangered infants. Adoptions of ape infants whose
mothers have disappeared is almost always by kin, typically brothers or possi-

carries in one hand, holds the baby Telephos ever so gently in the other. According to legend,
Heracles had a brief affair with a (supposedly chaste) priestess of Athena who abandoned their
baby at birth. The baby, Tclephos, was being suckled by a wild deer when Heracles found him.

blc fathers. The same males notorious for killing infants unlikely to be theirs
will, at other times, look out for those that might be.4 Picture the extremely
domineering hamadryas baboon male, a snout the color of raw beefsteak with
the intrusive habit of biting the neck of females who stray from his harem. Yet
when one of "his" females (this is the only nonhuman primate species for
which the term "harem" actually applies) went into labor too close to a cliff,
                       THREE     MEN    AND     A BABY
this tyrant responded with deft tenderness to catch the baby. A similar inter­
vention was witnessed in captivity, but this time-even more amazingly­
the midwife was a male orang-an event almost beyond the imaginings of
fieldworkers, for in the wild male orangutans are solitary. Shaggy hundred­
kilo titans crash through the jungle oblivious to mothers and infants, passing
females by like ships in the night, meeting with them only to mate.
    No less bizarre are the multiple cases of care-in-a-contingency offered by
notoriously nonnurturing langur males, best known for stalking babies, not
caring for them. Yet in a pinch, a brother or former consort of the mother
takes custody of an infant deposited with him by the mother. In a plot remi­
niscent of the film Three Men and a Baby, a mother langur leaves a· nearly
weaned infant with a group of males recently driven out of her breeding
group by an usurping male. She will return alone to face the potentially infan­
ticidal "stepfather" who now resides there. The same langur male that as a
juvenile showed no interest in joining his sisters as they scampered about
with borrowed babies becomes transformed into a solicitous custodian by the
overtures of a needy youngster.
    Why Males Don't Mother More (Proximate Causes)
If the circumstances are conducive, almost any primate male can be induced
to behave in a nurturing way. How is it, then, that it is almost always females
who end up holding babies? In only a tiny minority of species do males care
for infants even remotely as much as mothers do. Confronted with such over­
whelming evidence, it just seems "natural" to conclude that since mothers
provide the womb, develop the mammae, and energetically invest the most,
they therefore are the sex selected to nurture babies. End of story.
    But what if we don't end the story there?What if we look beyond the obvi­
ous to inquire further: Why is it that, even if they are not hungry, baby pri­
mates prefer mothers? Or, to bring the question closer to home: Why, even
among bottle-fed babies with both parents working outside the home, does
the traditional division of labor between father and maternal caretaker so
often emerge?
    In many mammals, retrieving, licking, "brooding," or protecting pups are
unisex potentials. What Darwin termed the "latent instincts," the basic wiring,
for such behavior seems to be there. 5 The underpinnings for caretaking arc
there; it's just not expressed under ordinary circumstances. Why not?

Like a male rat sensitized to caretake, the bachelors become not only competent but committed.

     Gender ideology is no help. How can culture and socialization explain sex
roles in mammals lacking language and symbolic thought? There must be
evolved emotional differences between males and females, differences that
go beyond the two major physical differences, birth and lactation. What
besides ideology produces this seemingly unbridgeable chasm of difference
between aloof fathers and "instinctively" caring mothers? Initial differences
turn out to be surprisingly minor-tiny compared with the magnitude of the
eventual dichotomy.

    Small Differences Much Magnified
What magnifies small differences into major divisions of labor? The simplest
answer is that people do, by following the path of least resistance. As Ed Wil­
son put it, "At birth the twig is already bent a little bit."7Where natural incli­
nations lead depends on how much effort is expended bending them back.
Among humans, conscious effort can minimize preexisting differences. More
212                 MOTHERS         AND   ALLOMOTHERS
often, small initial differences in responsiveness are exaggerated by life expe­
riences and then blown out of all proportion by cultural customs and norms.
    Imagine two working parents who start out with the noble intention of an
equal partnership caring for their new baby. The benefits of breast milk are
too important to forgo, so the mother uses a pump and stores bottles in the
freezer for the father to heat up when she can't be there. Within weeks, they
notice the baby has developed a preference for the mother. Soon it is painfully
obvious that the baby wants its mother. Aware that her husband is hurt and her
baby is unhappy, the mother quits her job and stays home with the baby.
"After all," she sighs, "you can't fool Mother Nature."
    Why did this young couple's good intentions go for naught? Recent
findings by anthropologists Joy Stallings and Carol Worthman at Emory
University, collaborating with developmental psychologist Alison Fleming
and coworkers at the University of Toronto, provide relevant clues. The
researchers asked new parents to listen to two recordings. One was the
sound of a day-old infant crying first thing in the morning when he wanted to
be fed. The second tape contained the more jagged and alarming cries of a
baby being circumcised. Reactions of mothers and fathers were carefully
monitored, and hormone levels (of cortisol, testosterone, and prolactin)
measured. At the first signal of real distress, both mothers and fathers
responded with equal alacrity. But if the infant merely sounded uncomfort­
able but not in extremis, if the cry was merely "I want" rather than "Help!
Help!" the mother was the quicker to respond. It's possible that the mother's
greater responsiveness and the physiological reactions that accompany it are
learned. More probably her lower threshold for responding to infant signals
is innate.
So the mother is more sensitive to infant needs than the father. So what? Who
cares? And that's just the point. The act of caring has its own consequences­
habits of mind and emotion. When we get down to the "underlying myster­
ies" that George Eliot called attention to, the causes of difference can be just
that simple. No doubt, other things are going on. The point is, consequences
are magnified out of proportion to initial causes.
    Just because the mother is more readily galvanized to respond to infant
demands does not mean that fathers are not able to do so, or that they cannot

become adequate caretakers, "good enough" caretakers, or that baby pri­
mates cannot form primary attachments to a male. Rather, a seemingly
insignificant difference in thresholds for responding to infant cues gradually,
insidiously, step by step, without invoking a single other cause, produces a
marked dh·ision of labor by sex .
    Recall our imaginary couple, just home from the hospital. From the nurs­
ery wafts the first sputtering sound of fretful wakening. Mother is already out
of her chair. She soothes baby, who never even reaches fuJI cry. AJI is quiet.
Baby coos contentedly. Further intervention is superfluous. "I would only be
needlessly intrusive," the father tells himself. There is no reason to move.
Mother has baby. Why disturb the peace by taking him from her? The result ,
of course, is that the baby's attachment to his mother intensifies. The baby
starts to complain whenever he is transferred from her to someone else.
    Yet aJI along there were alternatives. She could leave her baby alone with
her husband more. He could request that his wife wear earplugs, or, like
Odysseus, bind herself to the mast so she will not be able to respond to the
irresistible cal1 of her little siren. The neural equivalent of earplugs is what
Mother Nature opted for in the case of titi monkeys, rendering mothers
indifferent to the al1ure of infant cues. The result? Infants strongly prefer
fathers, and the males "just naturally," without conscious determination or
outside inter vention, do most of the childcare.
    Eliciting Paternal Devotion
Titi monkeys are as monogamous as primates get . The mother is so attached
to her mate that she borders on indifference toward her infant. After birth,
the father carries his newborn 93 percent of the time. This unusual monkey is
the exception that proves a larger rule: when a male primate's reproductive
success is substantiaJiy enhanced by assisting his mate rear offspring, and
when he has no better reproductive alternatives (the female titi makes sure of
that by driving away any female who enters her territory), he helps.8
    Sure, either titi partner may occasionally stray. They are primates, after
all, never so blindered that given an opportunity they won't at least lust in
their hearts or, should his or her partner's vigilance lapse, copulate with an
outsider. (Extra-pair copulations were first reported in titi monkeys in the
 1 96os, long before reports of female philandering in monogamous birds
caused a sensation in ornithological cirdes.)9 Nevertheless, the primary

                            ation of his care from her infant explains why a titi
                           mother is more attached to her mate than to her
                           baby. When psychologists William Mason and Sally
                            Mendoza at the California Primate Center used var­
                           ious endocrine measures to monitor responses to
                           different circumstances, they found that titi moth­
                            ers were far more stressed by a temporary separa­
                            tion from their mates than from their babies.
                                Once the infant has suckled, the titi mother wea­
                           ries of her heavy baby. She pushes it off. Since the
                           mated pair typically sit side by side on the same
branch, tails entwined, the father is nearby. Rejected by its mother, the baby
climbs aboard its father till it's time to suckle again. Thus docs the baby form
a primary attachment with him, not her.
    This is not really so strange. On the rare occasions when human fathers
or allofathcrs end up the sole caretaker, infants form primary attachments to
them. As the kindly neighbor who volunteers to teach Silas Marner how
to care for a child observes: "See there, she's fondest of you. She wants to go
                                                                                    "
to your lap, I'll be bound. Go then: Take her Master Marner.
    When Care Is Neither Exclusive nor Costly
Any male who provides exclusive care to an unrelated baby, and thereby fails
to sire children of his own, may find many satisfactions. But he docs not
increase his reproductive success. This is why Mother Nature sets the thresh­
old for direct and exclusive care of young higher in fathers than in mothers. If
primate mothers respond to infant needs right after birth, they arc unlikely
to ever misdirect their care. Males cannot he so sure.
    But what about assistance divisible among a number of babies? What if
care is only intermittently required? Far more common than the exclusive,
all-consuming care given by titi monkey fathers to offspring almost certain to
be their own is the flashier brand of male care, the quick intervention of a

Robin Hood who shows up eYcry so often, behaves like a hero, and then fades
away. Such fathering is di,·isihle (or "pa1·tihle" in the lingo of primatologists)
among many recipients. The important point is that a male need not he cer­
tain of paternity to prollc1· paternal-like assistance.
    Bctween the "dad" who is devoted to his kids and the "cad" who deserts
them lies a broad intermediate zone filled with occasional dads, and "tempo­
rary heroes." Such fathers may divide their time between many possible off­
spring. If an infant is possibly theirs, and intervention is not too risky, these
scattershot fathers can afford to be less than certain. If protection of an infant
from a predator or another male is essential for its survival, males can
scarcely afford to withhold it from an infant that might be theirs. Although
there is a tendency to assume that early hominids lived in nuclear families the
way married people do today, or perhaps in small "harems," no one knows
how they liYed. Hence, this "temporary hero" t y pe of father must be included
as one of the Yarious possible alternatives for how early hominid males inter­
                       10
acted with their kids.
sa,·anna baboon mothers breed in multi-male troops and stay in touch with
famrite former consorts. These special male friends look out for progeny
possibly their own. Hence, their relationships might provide insights into the
formation of the kind of pair-bonds we find in human parents committed to
the same child. However, it took the equivalent of a primatological "sting
operation" among the infanticide-prone baboons at Moremi to prove that
some males had the well-being of the infant in mind.
    Ryne Palombit, Robert Sey farth, and Dorothy Cheney from the Univer­
sity of Pennsylvania set up the sting by discreetly placing speakers where they
knew the baboons would pass. As each target male passed, he would hear the
taped sounds of a newly immigrant male harassing one of the recent mothers
he had a special relationship with. The adult male reacted immediately, rush­
ing to the defense of mother and infant. However, if the tape recording indi­
cated that the animal harassing her was just another female, the same male
exhibited little interest. If the mother's infant was no longer alive, the
"strange-male-hassling-y our-girlfriend" tape elicited no response whatsoever
from him.11 The researchers concluded that protection of infants from
strange males was indeed high on the possible father's list of priorities.

Fig. 9.6 Jeanne Altmann's 1980 diagram shows the special relationships forged between savanna
baboon mothers and adult males they have mated with. During the first three months after the
birth of her infant Moshi, his mother, Mom, stays closest to male Slim, but also engages in fre­
quent grooming with Peter. These "godfathers," of the genus Papio, defend the mother and her
infant from other baboons. This may not be "quantity time" but it is "quality time" in the most ele­
mental sense . Occasional intervention by former consorts can mean the difference between an
infant's life or death. (Courte9' ofjeanne Altmann)
     Several primatologists, most notably Carel van Schaik and Robin Dunbar,
have proposed that one of the main selection pressures on males to remain
near their mates after breeding-an essential precursor to monogamy and
any form of the nuclear family-was to guard mothers and offspring from
other males-especially infanticidal ones. As novelist Alison Lurie put it in
The War Between the Tates, her savagely funny dissection of American marriage,
"We need (menJ sometimes, if only to protect us from other men."
     A primate mother's best bet in such a system would be to find a mate
strong enough to protect her. However, if her mate dies , or is driven off by
                      THREE     MEN     AND     A   HAHY                     217
another male, she would he better ofT if she had associated with several
males, thereby improving the odds that there will be several candidates in the
neighborhood who classif)' her offspring as possibly "kin." At issue here is not
whether males can help protect or care for infants, hut how mothers can
moth·ate them to do so. Next to ensuring that she conceive with an appropri­
ate mate, the most important selection pressures shaping female sexuality in
primates have to do with forging relationships that promote tolerant, even
protecth·e, relations between a past or present consort and her infant.
    The Trouble with Being a Male Primate
A mother mammal relies on proximity right after birth to learn to recognize
the smells and sounds of her newborn baby. A male has only his past relation­
ship with the mother to go on. If he has managed to control access to the
mother during every moment when she was last fertile, his paternity is guar­
anteed. This contrasts with the situation for, say, pronghorn antelopes: when
it's time to breed, the pronghorn female surveys the scene, selects the most
vigorous male, and mates with him-just once. Then the matter is closed till
next season.
    Among such prosimians as the little African galago, the female may mate
with more than one male, but only during a brief period, lasting a few hours.
The rest of the time an epithelial membrane seals the galago's vagina shut,
and intromission is impossible. But for simian primates, the window of
opportunity during which copulations can occur is more flexible. Worse
(from the male's point of view), in most primates there is no conspicuous
midcycle signal advertising ovulation, such as the red swelling on a baboon or
chimpanzee. Under some circumstances (for example, when strange males
enter her troop) a monkey female may solicit males although she is not ovu­
lating, something neither Saint Augustine nor the Catholic Church was aware
of when they mistakenly assumed that intercourse without possibility of con-
      .                1 12
cept10n was unnatura .
     Exactly why monkey and ape females are so sexually flexible, or why they
go to so much trouble to solicit matings from extra males, is much debated.
Among the various explanations proposed is that females are ensuring that
conception occurs. Or they might be increasing the odds of bearing offspring
sired by males \Vith superior genes. Perhaps they are reducing the chances of
inbred offspring sired by close relatives. 13 One consequence of female wan­
derlust is that only a male who completely excludes other males from his

Fig. 9·7 Relatively few primate species advertise ovulation with conspicuous sexual swellings. In
most species, females are more subtle. A langur around the time of ovulation solicits males by
presenting her rump and frenetically shuddering her head. She exhibits no other visible sign .
Females vary in the intensity of their head shudder, so only a resident male has reliable informa­
tion about her actual cycle phase and probable fertility. (Daniel B.Hrdy/Anthro-Photo)
mate's vicinity can afford to regard his recent sexual history with the mother
as a reliable cue for paternity. By the same token , the margin of uncertainty
surrounding paternity could forestall males who recently mated with the
mother from harming her subsequent offspring-an infant that just misht be
theirs. T his is one of several benefits mothers derive from being able to
manipulate the information available to males concerning paternity.
     Whatever the explanation for this polyandrous component to female mat­
ing habits, there are obvious repercussions for males. To remain competitive
with other males in his vicinity, a male primate must grow large enough
to dominate and control females, and to exclude rival males (the way domi­
nant male gorillas do). Or else he must evolve large testicles and ejaculate
plentiful, high-quality sperm in order to compete in a different arena, inside
the reproductive tract of a female he will never manage to monopolize.

Fig. 9.8 Comparisons of the genitalia of Great Apes conform with the general rule. Males in one­
male breeding units, like gorillas, have smaller testes rclath·c to their body weight than do males
in species where a number of males mate on the same day with a female who conspicuously
advertises ovulation. Hence, a 1 7o-kilogram male gorilla who is able to prevent other males
from getting anywhere ncar ovulating females in his "harem" has testes weighing just 2 7 grams,
compared to the enormous 14o-gram testes of a considerably smaller, 4�-kilo chimp. Because a
chimp does not have the luxury of excluding competing males, his sperm competes inside the
female's vaginal tract with the sperm of rival males. Humans have testes proportionally larger
than those of the underendowed gorilla, but considerably smaller than those of chimps. Men fall
with orangs among primarily monandrous (or one-male-at-a-time) breeders. This might be
interpreted as showing that our ancestors lived in one-male breeding sy stems, but with just
enough lapses to maintain continuing selection for moderately large testicles. Alternatively, it
could mean that selection favoring large testes was once important hut no longer is, and men arc
slowly evolving smaller testes. With no advantage to maintain the extra sperm-producing capac­
ity of testes, through time the average testes size in humans might become smaller still, sperm
counts lower. (Courtesy ofrhe.�. H. Schulrz-St!fiung,Anthropologicallnstitute, University ofZunch)
Larger testes give a competitive edge to the male who produces the most (or
most competitive) sperm. But without DNA tests, who knows which male
that is?14
     Woman's Sexual Legacy
From galagos to bonobos, female primates range from being sexually recep­
tive for just a few hours right around midcycle to being able to copulate
(although not necessarily desirous of doing so) across extended periods of the

Fig. 9. 9 a and b. Early reports about honobos sounded like flights of feminist fancy. In addition to
their free-wheeling sexual ways, females have feeding priority, and may share food they obtain
with the offspring of female friends. Bonobo swellings can last weeks at a stretch. Prolonged sex­
ual attractiveness helps females to cement alliances and to exchange sexual favors for food. (a)
This bonobo engages in face-to-face sex, rubbing her genitals against those of the female beneath
her. As in common chimps, the bonobo's clitoris (insert b) is both absolutely and relatively larger
than that of a woman . In bonohos it is frontally placed, presumably to facilitate the achievement
of orgasm during genital-to-genital rubbing and to provide a proximate reward for alliance
building. Some evolutionists have argued that the clitoris is nothing more than a vestigial penis,
present in females hecause it is nt'cessary in males. More likely, however, selection has also oper­
ated independently on the clitoris and the penis . This would explain why the chimp and bonobo
clitoris is larger than that found in humans, while the opposite is the case for the penis, which is
larger in humans than in either bonobos or chimps. 1 s (Courtesy '!f:4m;· Parish)
cycle. Human females fall at the extreme end of this continuum, at the far
edge of flcxihlc, situation-dependent receptivity. Although in most cultures
people avoid intercourse during menstruation and for long periods post­
partum, women arc capahle of mating on any day of the menstrual cycle. Yet
vestiges of"estrus" (or cyclical sexual urges) persist.
     Like other primates, women experience a mild to pronounced increase in
libido hctwcen menstruation and ovulation, during the phase of the cycle
when the follicle ripens in preparation for releasing the egg. The exact time of
ovulation can he speeded up or slowed down depending on circumstances. If,
for example, a woman is exposed to pheromones from the armpits of another
                       THREE     MEN    AND     A  BABY                      221
woman who is just about to onilate, it may cause her to ovulate sooner. In
 1998 Martha McClintock, one of the pioneers of biosocial psychology,
experimentally confirmed the existence of these long-suspected airborne
chemicals wafting from one woman to another. She was able to entrain one
woman to another's cycle by attaching cotton swabs from the armpit of the
donor to the upper lip of a woman in another cycle phase. 1(,
    This olfactory component to female cycling has to be very old. The same
may be said for behavioral predispositions linked to ovulation, such as a
woman's increased sexual yearnings at midcycle. These responses serve as
reminders that even though our rear ends do not swell up and turn bright red
like a chimp's, and although we rationalize our actions more than baboons
and langurs do, the origins of our sexual urges predate the Pleistocene. Mod­
ern hominids have not entirely lost cyclical estrus, although its manifestations
have become much modified and subdued.
    A broad range of field and laboratory studies now confirm that women
around the time of ovulation-when a monkey or ape would be in estrus­
arc more likely to feel self-confident, to experience erotic fantasies, and to
initiate sex. This pattern became apparent when researchers excluded sexual
behavior initiated by husbands or lovers and just focused on female-initiated
sex. A woman also has a somewhat lower threshold for experiencing orgasm
around ovulation-a patterning to female libido found in both heterosexual
and lesbian pairings, and during both intercourse and masturbation. 17
    Women at midcyclc arc more restless and move around more. They have
enhanced motor capability, possibly a heightened sense of smell, 18 and are
probably better able to discriminate healthy from unhealthy people. All in all,
women at midcycle test higher, including in an academic sense-all the bet­
ter, one assumes, to use their "wanderlust" to greatest advantage by assaying
the available males and choosing well, and perhaps also using heightened sen­
sitivity to danger to avoid punishment by possessive mates. Recall (p. 85) the
West African chimps who slipped away to the neighboring community and
hack without anyone (apparently other chimps as well as human observers)
the wiser.
    So far the only in-depth study of hunter-gatherers that combines personal
interviews with information on a woman's cycle state (determined from
blood samples) is the one done in the 1970s among eight women belonging
to the same community as Nisa. Anthropologists Carol Worthman and Mel
Konner documented statistically significant increases in "sexual desire"
222                 MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
around the time of ovulation. These women were more likely to report hav­
ing had sex with their husband during the follicular phase of their cycle than
during the postovulatory, luteal phase. They were also at that time more likely
to have sex with men other than their husbands. Midcycle also brought with
it a slightly higher probability (not statistically significant) of experiencing
orgasm.19
For a long time, it was assumed that the female orgasm was a uniquely human
trait. Some even suggested that female orgasms evolved in the course of
human evolution to make women satisfied with one male. But this is unlikely.
For one thing , we now know that female orgasms occur in at least some other
                                                             20
primates, although in a different context than in humans.
    It is possible that in baboons and chimps the pleasurable sensations of sex­
ual climax once functioned to condition females to seek sustained clitoral
stimulation by mating with successive partners, one right after the other, and
that orgasms have since become secondarily enlisted by humans to serve
other ends (such as enhancing pair-bonds). Anyone who notices how erratic
the occurrence of female orgasm is, from intercourse alone, compared with
male orgasm , which invariably accompanies ejaculation, might well wonder
whether this curious psychophy siological response currently has any adaptive
function at all.
    Recently, British biologists Robin Baker and Mark Bellis suggested that
female orgasms do currently have a function: to ensure that a mother's egg is
fertilized by the best male. Their hypothesis rests on three as yet unproven
assumptions:
     1.  that orgasm produces an "upsuck" response that increases sperm reten­
         tion;
    2.   that orgasm increases the probability of impregnation; and
    3• that women are more likely to experience orgasm when mating with
         males who have superior genes.
    So far, all that has been conclusively demonstrated is that given sufficient
clitoral stimulation, any female achieves orgasm-with a male partner, a
female partner, or masturbating alone , although females may experience
                      THREE       MEN      AND   A BABY
orgasms more readily at midcycle-which may also be when women are
                                                                               21
more likely not only to become pregnant but to seek extra-pair copulations.
    A persuasive case can be made that orgasms (whether in women or bono­
bas) dispel tension and strengthen bonds between partners. But such obser­
vations arc not sufficient to argue that orgasms evolved for this purpose, or
that orgasms currently have any effect on a woman's fertility or ability to
keep her infants alive. If anything, the opposite seems more nearly true, given
that the vast majority of women today across large areas of the world (much
of Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East) live in coercively patriarchal soci­
eties. Female libido and sexual assertiveness are dangerous predispositions in
such contexts, more likely to get a woman beaten, disfigured, or killed than

    For compared to other primates, men have many more sources of infor­
mation about where their mates have been , and what they have been doing
(not the least of which is gossip). Knowing how risky extra-pair sex can often
be for females in my own species has led me to wonder if female orgasms may
be a once adaptive retention now no longer selected for, like the grasp of a
just-born baby for maternal fur that no longer exists, a reflex gradually fading
out of the human repertoire. If so, our descendants living on starships eons
from now may find themselves wondering what all the fuss was about.
Much has been made of the fact that men have stronger libidos than women
do. In Darwin's time, experts were convinced that women were sexually pas­
sive and that "the appetite never asserts itself." Today it is assumed that
women are interested, albeit not nearly so much so as men.
     W hen asked by a psychotherapist how often she and her husband have sex,
Diane Keaton in the title role of the film Annie Hall complains, "Constantly!
I'd say three times a week." By contrast, Woody Allen, playing her husband,
answers, "Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week."To make this same point
using quantitative data, evolutionary psychologists have a favorite experi­
ment. T hey send out student shills to proposition opposite-sexed "research
subjects" encountered about campus. In line with both the old stereotypes
and the widely accepted predictions from evolutionary theory, 7 � percent of
the male students approached agreed to "go to bed" with the experimenter
(no information available on what happens next), while none of the coeds
                   MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
did. 23 The dichotomous results conform to the widespread expectation that
ardent and lustful males pursue discriminating, chaste, or even, as Darwin
termed them, "coy" females.
    The results of the solicitation experiment are taken as powerful confirma­
tion of Robert Trivers's truism: since mammalian mothers invest so much
more in offspring than fathers do, they cannot afford to be indiscriminate;
they need to be much more selective about who they mate with than do
males. 24 But the tricky part comes when the interpretation of these results is
taken a step further, cited as proof that there has been far stronger selection
on male sexual desire than on that of females, or even to show that there has
been no selection in women for sexual desire. Such a black-and-white view of
the sexes is seriously at odds with field observations of female chimpanzees
and barbary macaques in estrus soliciting and copulating with multiple part­
ners with a lust and avidity that evolutionary theorists traditionally reserve
for males.
    In their extreme forms, such stereotypes derive not only from wishful
thinking on the part ofVictorian men but from an invalid comparison. The
experiments ignore social context. It is both physically dangerous for a
woman to go home with a strange man and dangerous to her reputation for
her to be perceived as interested in doing so, especially when the individual
soliciting her behaves so peculiarly and indiscreetly as the experimenter. An
even bigger problem is that one of the subjects being compared is a continu­
ously potent male, the other is an only intermittently fertile female.
    In men, production of sperm in the testes goes on all the time. Males ejac­
ulate, and then, after a refractory period, can, given the opportunity, ejacu­
late again. Their sperm count may go down in successive ejaculations, but it is
soon replenished. Indeed, a male's batteries may be recharged sooner rather
than later if a novel and desirable partner is introduced, or if a male reen­
counters his own partner after a long separation. In short, this is a gamete­
making machine almost continuously charged and ready to reproduce, not
just ever-ready to mate but ever-ready to fertilize. Compare Mr. Ever-Ready
to a woman .
    Women, like men (indeed, even more so than men, since no erection
need he sustained) arc continuously able to copulate, even though they may
not, and often do not, desire to. However, if we confine the comparison of
men's and women's libidos to just the period when women arc actually
reproductive, comparing Mr. Ever-Ready with Ms. Intermittently Fertile,
                        THREE       MEN    AND     A   BABY
the much-remarked dichotomy between ardent males and coy females begins
to pale. Given the boorish behavior of the shills, the coed still ought to say no;
but it would be informative if the experimenters had more sensitive methods
to detect whether or not she was aroused by the proposal.
    Why Smart Women Make Foolish Choices
Adaptive or not, holding steady or fading out, it would be a mistake to under­
estimate the power of libidinous retentions. Consider the mysterious process
we call "falling in love." Ancient legacies figure here as well .
    No one has been more innovative in examining the subtleties of women's
cyclicity than Dutch sexologist Koos Slob. Slob was among the first scientists
to measure uterine contractions and increased heart rate in female macaques
during sexual climax, thus helping to confirm that female orgasms occur in
other primates and were almost certainly part of the package of traits the ear­
liest hominids brought to the human experiment. When Slob used sophisti­
cated new techniques to measure sexual arousal in women, he was amazed
not just by how profoundly cyclical women's sexual responses were, but by
how far-ranging the implications of that cyclicity could be.
    During the first half (or, follicular phase) of their cycle, women were
more aroused by erotic films than during their postovulatory (luteal)
phase-not a result one would expect in an animal whose sexual responses
were culturally constructed, or among whom love and romance depend only
on context. But Slob's work also carries a warning for those who would
reduce human mate choices to simple chemistry. A woman who happened to
he in the follicular phase of her cycle the first time she saw the film footage
was more likely to be sexually aroused by it than were controls who saw the
same film at other times . But the second time the test subject saw the same
film, she responded to it the same way she had the first time, regardless of her
cycle state. It was as if recollections of her past libidinous feelings took prece­
dence over how fertile she was on that day. 25
    Along with all the sensible things a prospective mother should be attend­
ing to (such as a potential mate's health, body size, strength, ability to protect
her and her children, his intelligence, and indicators of "good genes"),
women may also be influenced by such seemingly extraneous variables as the
cycle day on which they first met.
    Imagine: a woman at midcycle looks at a man more intently than she
might otherwise do. Chronically alert to just such opportunities, the man
 226                MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
 stares back. Subconsciously, he notes her body language, the dilation of her
 pupils, and gauges her interest and responds accordingly. One thing leads to
 another . . . but, when, later in her cycle, she remembers that man, her
 emotions will be colored not just by his merits, but by how she felt when first
 aroused. It is a comparative sexologist's angle on why smart women so often
 make foolish choices. An awareness of our primate heritage carries with it a
 warning to women of good sense to keep an eye on their calendars. Ovula­
 tion can be hazardous to your judgment.
    Some Fathers Who Can Afford to Care
 Human mothers need male investment as never before. No other primate
produces babies quite so needy, or dependent, for quite so long. Yet theoreti­
cally only a male with a high certainty of paternity should be willing to pro­
 vide it. Of the 40 percent of primate species that exhibit some form of male
care, only monogamously mated males like titi monkeys with a high probabil­
ity of being the father provide direct and extensive care. Ethnographic informa­
tion for different human societies (these data all referring to the same species)
similarly suggests that paternal care is most intensive where monogamously
                                                 26
mated men have a high certainty of paternity.
    Consider the Aka pygmies of Central Africa. During the first six months of
life, the average father holds his infant more than 2o percent of the time and
remains within arm's reach of the baby an unheard-of so percent of the time.
Aka fathers mostly marry just one wife. They spend long periods at camp and
appear to have invented "flex-time." Help from fathers sustains relatively high
fertility (Aka women average 6.3 live births) without causing child mortality
to rise any higher than among the !Kung, who reproduce far more slowly. 27
    Aka togetherness is facilitated by a family-friendly workplace. Hunting­
mostly for small game-is done using nets, so that men, women, and chil­
dren can all safely and practically participate. W hen men go off to hunt,
mothers and children go with them. How typical or atypical was the Aka
lifestyle for forest-dwellers in the Pleistocene? Not known. Recent archaeo­
logical discoveries indicate, however, that hunting with nets is very old, dat-
.                                 28
mg bac k 3o,ooo years or more.
    In Western industrial countries like the United States, the 1 99os are being
hailed as the new "era of the involved father." Fifty-six percent of men inter­
viewed in a recent study by the DuPont company indicated that they want to
spend more time with their families. But is this really so new? Ethnographic
                         THRFF      MEN AND       A BABY                     227
and historical sources suggest that some men were always interested in being
with their families. Variation among men in the past probably fell along a sim­
ilar continuum ranging from the "new man," proudly and euphorically
"engrossed" in his baby son, to the stereotypical self-absorbed CEOs who act
as if they do not know they have children, to "deadbeat dads," totally resistant
to investing in them. 29
    Hype about "new fathers" notwithstanding, the DuPont survey calls atten­
tion to a valid obser vation. Across cultures, the amount of time men spend
caring for kids is the best predictor of how connected they feel toward them.
For example, the same proximity that puts a foraging father on the spot to
help out, and induces him to become emotionally involved with his kids, also
brings greater certainty of paternity. An Aka father spends 46 percent of each
day within view of his wife. This is one reason such peoples as theAka have
become to ethnography what titi monkeys are to primatology. Both represent
ideal types-"chestnuts," as it were-useful for illustrating a correlation
between pair-bonding and direct and extensive male care.
    The Hearts of Men
Given the obvious advantages of male care, why don't primate fathers­
human fathers in particular-always tend to their progeny, or at least devote
more attention to infants? Part of the reason, as I hope I have shown, is simply
opportunity and exposure. Given the right circumstances, males do care. But
there are also more fundamental reasons why women have lower thresholds
for responding to infant needs than men do. Males who invested in infants not
their own would be genetically out-competed by males whose priority was
seeking additional mates. Males arc torn between impulses to protect and
care for their offspring, at least a little bit, and their desire for novel part­
ners. 30
    From a man's perspective, a mate with heightened libido at precisely the
time when she is most fertile is a dangerous liability. Not long ago, feminist
economist Claudia Golden assumed she was making a joke about remote
fathering when she quipped that "We never ask [high-powered career]
men whether they have children. I guess we assume some of them don't
know.    . . ."31 But truth to tell, how could they? Golden had inadvertently
stumbled on one of the ultimate causes of bad fathering, the nagging problem
male primates have always faced: How to be certain of paternity? We pri­
mates are not like fish, where males come along and fer tilize eggs that
228                MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
are already laid. Nor are we absolutely monandrous, like the pronghorn
antelopes, among whom a female mates just one time per conception. It's not
just "a wise father who knows his own child," it's either a father who runs his
home like a seraglio with a eunuch at the gate, or else one who has a DNA fin­
gerprinting lab at his disposal.
    True enough, as economist Golden stresses, many men are far too busy
striving for status (in par t to impress other men and additional mates) to be
any thing other than oblivious to their children. But there is another reason
these men ignore their infants: their thresholds for paternal investment are
set high. And the reason for this is that female primates did not evolve so as to
guarantee their mates certain paternity. For humans the consequences can be
surprising.
    The Show-Off Hypothesis
In I 986 a group of behavioral ecologists embarked on a re-study of the Hadza
of northern Tanzania. Aware that hunting was the main source of protein,
they began with the classic premise of optimal foraging theory. They pre­
dicted that men would plan their hunts so as to maximize the amount of meat
they brought back to camp, consistent with acceptable risk-taking. But the
researchers were surprised to discover how inefficient the hunters were. A
Hadza hunter could expect a full month of failures for every successful kill.
This was not because game was hard to come by, but because the hunters held
out for the biggest prey they could take-creatures like the sleek, elusive,
and mar velously fleshy eland. Men tracked these imposing beasts for days,
even though the same effort devoted to lesser prey-rock hyraxes or guinea
fowl-would yield higher returns.
    Whenever the researchers could persuade the hunters to lower their
sights, the Hadza invariably came out ahead in terms of protein and calories
earned for effort expended . Self-inflicted inefficiency was the first surprise.
The second was discovering that after a month of unsuccessful hunts, when a
Hadza hunter did kill something big, he retained only a fraction of the meat
for his own family. A hunter who killed an eland kept only I 9 percent of the
enormous Ho-kilogram carcass for his own wife and children. T he vast
majority of it was shared with other group members who spontaneously
appeared "to help" eat it. Only if a hunter repeatedly failed and was forced to
resort to hunting small game did his family get to keep the entire portion .
                        THREE        MEN AND       A  HABY
    Well, such is the price of success, one might argue. An eland is too much
meat for one family. But the Hadza climate is very dry. Sliced meat quickly
deYelops a crusty rind and could easily be stored, ot· traded as jerky. Yet this
does not happen. As is typical of hunter-gatherers, Hadza hunters neither
brag about success nor attempt to claim meat as personal property. 12 Instead,
they tolerate a system in which the families of failed hunters-sometimes
including families of men who have not killed prey in anyone's memory-can
end up with the most meat.
    According to the Hadza ethic, the more a hunter obtains, the more he
gives away. This is a fairly general pattern among hunter-gatherers. From each
according to his means, to everybody else . Had evolutionary storytelling
come full circle, back to group selection? Were men storing up credit for
another day, against an unlucky stint when the hunter would have nothing,
while another, luckier, group member might have meat to reciprocate? Was
meat so rich and succulent, so desired and public a good, that no man could
afford to retain exclusive access?33 Or were men choosing to hunt larger prey
because by killing a creature with mythical status some of the animal's cha­
risma rubbed off on the hunter? This is when one of the team, Kristen
Hawkes, started to wonder if large game-meat that a man would have to
gh·e away-might not be worth more to a man in terms of prestige than as
food in the mouths of his children .
    According to Hawkes's "show-off" hypothesis, it was reputation that
hunters were maximizing, not protein. Not only would other men respect
him more, but women wowed by his prowess and intrigued by the prospect
of gifts of meat might grant him sexual favors. W hat looked like parental
effort was more nearly reproductive effort, as hunters exchanged food for
sex in a time-honored performance characteristic of every primate in which
males hunt. 34 That "women like meat" was the standard !Kung explanation
for why a particularly poor hunter remains a bachelor and has no prospects of
ever being anything but celibate. 35
How typical are Hadza show-offs? Not known. However, a recent survey
of the shopping habits of       1 67  British couples was eerily consistent with
Hawkes's view of male foragers: "showing off " took priority over economy.
                   MOTHERS       AND    ALLOMOTHERS
Even when men have the same amount of shopping experience as women,
husbands and boyfriends shop less economically. Seventy-three percent of the
time they chose different brand names than their wives, almost always more
expensive ones. Men spent 1 o percent more on shampoo, 6 percent more on
butter, 5 percent more on coffee. Men apparently find it hard to resist the
brand names and the occasional big-ticket items-the thirty-dollar bottle of
burgundy that magically materializes in the shopping cart. 36 Male shoppers
arc more tantalized than women by the prospect of showing off with the
"grand gesture."
    Economic surveys from developing countries as far afield and as culturally
different as India, Guatemala, and Ghana reveal that the nutritional level of
children in a family does not increase in direct proportion to paternal
income. Only increasing women's income has a direct effect. T he show-off
hypothesis is not only consistent with the man who stops off at a pub for a
pint with his buddies while the kids are hungry at home, but with actual sta­
tistics from the United States Department of Health and Human Services
concerning the large number of men who are more amenable to making car
payments than paying child support. 37
    Monogamy as a Compromise That Children Win
Once again, Nisa's biography provides a !Kung San forager's perspective on
the tensions underlying human pair-bonds. Nisa marries four times, always
monogamously. When her first husband, Tashay, brings home a second wife,
Nisa recalls, "I chased her away and she went back to her parents." Several of
Nisa's marriages dissolved under the strain of infidelities, either her hus­
band's or her own. In addition to her four husbands, eight lovers pass in and
out of her life. Nisa is quite obviously in love with several of them. "Pair­
bonds" were formed, but the relationships did not last. 38
    Two of Nisa's pregnancies probably derive from affairs with men other
than her husband at the time. As Nisa's daughterTwi grows up to look more
and more like her husband's brother, with whom Nisa was having an affair
when the child was conceived, her husband reminds her that his younger
brother is the likely progenitor and therefore "will help take care of her."
Whenever Nisa finds herself between husbands, when she is widowed or
divorced, she sets out across the Kalahari to find her brother and live with
  .
h1m. l9
                      THREE       MEN ANL>      A   BABY                      231
    Hunter-gatherer societies like the !Kung San are as egalitarian as tradi­
tional societies ever get. Nisa's husbands were physically stronger than she,
able to dominate her, but if she was unhappy enough, Nisa could always vote
with her feet and leave. Even when Nisa was caught by her husband in fla­
grante delicto with a ·lover and beaten and threatened with murder, others
stood up for her, and life went on. In more patriarchal societies, her perpet­
ual adulteries would have been lethal.
   Since none ofNisa's children survived to adulthood, the life of this spunky
woman can scarcely be said to typify success in evolutionary terms. Yet the
tensions that characterized her marriages are the same ones that Nisa's
mother mentions. Again and again, her predicaments crop up in women's life
stories.
   Nisa cherished her freedom of movement, her freedom to choose mates,
and, if her husband did not provide sufficient food, her freedom to negotiate
with lovers. Each husband, on the other hand, wanted multiple wives for
himself but also to maintain exclusive sexual access to Nisa. There is a
dynamic tug-of-war in these relationships that is at odds with conventional
pipe dreams about humans having an innate tendency to form long-lasting
pair-bonds, unions in which both sexes have a powerful commitment from
within to adhere. Such cases make it hard to sustain the illusion that lifelong
monogamous families are the natural human condition.
   Monogamy in Nisa's case is more nearly a compromise than a species­
typical universal. Monogamy is the most harmonious common ground she
and her husband of the moment can arrive at. And when it works, children
benefit. Monogamy reduces inherent conflicts of interest between the sexes.
Her reproductive success becomes his, and vice versa, promoting harmonious
relations between genetically distinct individuals striving toward common
goals.
    Sociobiology is not a field known for the encouraging news it offers either
sex. Yet its most promising revelation to date has to be that over evolutionary
time, lifelong monogamy turns out to be the cure for all sorts of detrimental
devices that one sex uses to exploit the other. As usual, this point is most con­
vincingly demonstrated in organisms that breed much faster than we humans
do. Once again, fruit flies are the organism of choice, the current favorites for
studying coevolution between the sexes. This time, the experiments have a
"happy ending."
232                MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
    Recall that female fruit flies mate promiscuously with many partners. To
counter female promiscuity and thwart their rivals, male ejaculate is laced
with special components that enhance an ejaculator's reproductive success,
even though their cumulative effects in females are toxic. Amazingly though,
in just forty-seven generations of experimentally imposed monogamy,
researchers Brett Holland and William Rice produced strains of male
drosophila whose seminal fluid was no longer toxic to females. At one level,
monogamy is a compromise offering something for everyone-especially
immatures. All males got to breed, at least a little. Females had less choice
among males, but they lived longer. Meanwhile, offspring were more viable.
    So who says evolutionists are necessarily antithetical to family values?The­
oretically at least, I know of no reason why Holland and Rice's experiment
would not produce similar results in the temperaments of men and women,
although the experimenters would need to locate a population of volunteers
who could precommit for descendants, guaranteeing their absolute fidelity
for fifty or more generations. The result would be a strain of men and women
whose first priorities were to the well-being of their children.
No wonder, then, that as a mother in the modern world, where children
require more parental investment than ever before over a longer time if they
are to prepare for a successful life, I personally am partial to the companion­
ate monogamous marriage. Long-term trust permits unparalleled efficiency
and emotional satisfaction. I place a high priority on the benefits that two
cooperating parents offer children. Precisely because I am aware of my bias, I
consciously guard against distorted readings of such evidence we have for
early hominid mating systems as would cause me to project upon my ances­
tors-who lived under different circumstances-the same choices I have
made.40
   I assume that mothers in the past were emotionally similar to me. But they
made their decisions under different, vastly more arduous, circumstances. It
would scarcely he wise, or fair, to extrapolate my self-interested priorities to
them. Nevertheless, from Victorian times to the present, this is what many
anthropologists and evolutionists have blithely done.
   Earlier commentators failed to consider how unusual are the particular
environmental and demographic conditions that make long-term monogamy

adnntageous for both sexes. For monogamy to benefit a mother, her mate
must be in a position to protect her or to reliably provision her. Demographic
rates and sources of mortality are also important. High adult survival rates
among men make it worthwhile for them to invest in relationships. But docs
the protection they offer matter? This depends on what the sources of infant
mortality are (pathogens, or human enemies?). Where fathers make a differ­
ence and infants also have good prospects of survival, a father can afford the
emotional luxury of sharing his mate's commitment to quality over quantity.
When, however, children are susceptible to sudden, unpredictable demise, it
should not be surprising that men go to great lengths to sire as many as possi­
ble, in the hopes that some will by chance survive.
An old ditty proYided by psychologist William James is a great favorite with
sociobiologists. It runs: "Higamous, hogamous, woman's monogamous.
Hogamus, higamus, men are polygamous." Contemporary Darwinians Don­
ald Symons, Roger Short, and Laura Bctzig have made strong cases that men in
                  MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
the past sought many mates because by doing so they increased their repro­
ductive success. Women, by contrast, did better locating one good man will­
ing and able to invest in her offspring. But there is a missing caveat to James's
ditty: "Except where males arc poor providers, likely to die young, or when
resources are unpredictable-then mothers are far better off polyandrous"­
if they can be so safely. A woman's children may be better off with several
"fathers" than with one inferior or unreliable one.
    Unpredictable providers confront mothers with a dilemma: Should she
rely on one man for much, or on several for something? W hat about in patri­
archal societies, where maternal choices arc circumscribed from the outset.
Should she seck 1 oo percent of a poor mate or settle for some fraction of the
investment to be provided by a polygynously mated potentate? From a
mother's perspective, the optimal number of "fathers" all depends.

T
            hat fathers matter is obvious. But they cannot always be relied
            upon. W hen fathers die or defect; when men seduce or rape women
            and then decamp, or when they fail to protect their wives from the
\"iolence of other men; when husbands seek other mates, prospects are
diminished for the offspring they leave behind. In the absence of effective
laws protecting the person or property r ights of women, early mothers had
to rely on such fathers or alloparents as they could enlist-husbands, lovers ,
or, failing them, male kin.N o matter how Apollo-like the progenitor, how
skilled a hunter, how good his genes, how viable his immune system, his
absence put his children at a disadvantage. Even in matrilineal societies,
where descent and transmission of rights are transmitted through the female
line and mothers typically have an unusual degree of reproductive autonomy,
when property rights are transmitted, they still pass from the mother's
brother to her son. Parents recognize that sons arc more likely to be able to
hold on to property than daughters are. 1
    Being Fatherless
In industrialized countries, disadvantages to fatherless families include eco­
nomic hardship, reduced status, and generally declining prospects. Costs to
children are measurable in poorer school performance, higher rates of delin­
quency for boys, and early pregnancies for girls.In foraging societies father­
less children are more likely to die.
    "I am without the man I married ...         "the !Kung San woman Nisa wailed
when she lost her first husband. Men were the main providers of protein.
Well might she ask: "Where will I see the food that will help my children

                   MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
grow? Who is going to help me raise this newborn? My older brother and my
younger brother are far away.''2
    Among the Ache, an infant who lost his father was four times more likely
to die before the age of two. Even if the father was still alive, Ache children
whose parents divorced were three times more likely to be killed than if the mar­
riage endured. When a widowed or abandoned mother takes a new mate,
risks to her infants shoot up. Terrible prospects are one reason why some for­
aging peoples bury orphans alive along with the deceased parent. 3
    Stepfathers Worse Than No Father
Westerners appalled by such barbaric treatment of the fatherless should take
a look at their local newspapers. Child homicide in civilized societies is
nowhere tolerated, very much against the law, and uncommon. Neverthe­
less, in North America when the father of offspring under two years of age no
longer lives in the home and an unrelated man or stepfather lives there
instead, this rare event is seventy times more likely to occur. 4
    The murder of infants by stepfathers or mothers' boyfriends resembles
the circumstances under which sexually selected infanticide evolved in other
primates: males from outside the breeding system increase their own chances
to breed by eliminating offspring sired by rivals. The superficial similarities
have sometimes led to the erroneous conclusion that child abuse as we know
it today is or once was adaptive. 5 Some clarification is in order.
    Canadian psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson were the first to
demonstrate increased risk to infants from having unrelated men in the
house. They were careful to stress that in postindustrial human societies,
neither child abuse nor infanticide is adaptive. More likely than not, the
boyfriend goes to jail and the mother is prosecuted for neglect. More impor­
tant, the attacker is not some invader entering the breeding system from out­
side it: he already has keys to the apartment and access to the mother's bed.
Imagine: the mother goes off on an errand, leaving her baby in the boy­
friend's care. She may or may not have an inkling of the risk. Perhaps she
senses that her boyfriend resents diversion of household resources, including
her attention, to some other man's child. (Among the Ache, mothers them­
selves sometimes kill fatherless infants after a conscious evaluation of what
               TilE    OPTIMAL        NUMBER        01' l'ATHERS              237
the future holds.) Perhaps boyfriend and baby are already off to a had start­
all the more reason why the hahy may reject such tcntativc comfort as this
man offers. The baby cries, makes demands not willingly met hy a man in no
way sensitized for this task. Mother Nature has set high his threshold against
altruism toward this insatiable stranger. Because of the low degree of related­
ness between the man and the child, the benefits don't come close to out­
weighing the costs of care. 6
    But beyond his lack of solicitude for an unrelated, very vulnerable but
demanding dependent, the abusive boyfriend may have little more in com­
mon with an infanticidal monkey than a certain nonspecific impatience, a
general predisposition to respond violently to repeated annoyance. By con­
trast with the boyfriend's violence, the infanticidal langur's attack is purpose­
ful and goal-oriented. Injury comes after hours of single-minded stalking of
the infant. Such males arc often in a special state of arousal, as evidenced by
an erect penis, though without other indications of sexual interest. The lan­
gur utters a distinctive hacking vocalization, a "cackle hark," rarely heard in
other contexts. His attack is as organized and focused as a shark's.
    If relatives of the infant intervene, or if the mother eludes him, the langur
male starts over, inching closer. Infants killed by infanticidal langurs typically
die from puncture wounds in the skull. To usc canine teeth to bite a baby that
way is the simian equivalent of pulling out a hunting knife and stabbing the
quarry. This behavior, when observed, cannot be considered accidental.
Infant-biting by usurping male langurs bears little resemblance to the tragic
blend of frustration, brutality, and terrible judgment that results in "shaken
baby syndrome."
    A more appropriate animal analogue for a brutal stepfather would be an
alloparent of either sex compelled to invest in an infant he or she has lost
interest in. The motive is not to kill the infant in order to increase reproduc­
tive access to the mother, but to rid oneself of an encumbrance. What evolved
is not the bizarre and maladaptive alternation of solicitude with torture that
we know as "child abuse."What evolved was a high threshold for responding
in a solicitous way toward an offspring not likely to be genetically related­
the equivalent of emotional earplugs. 7
    When Strangers Capture Mothers
Boyfriends who fatally abuse babies in their charge do not thereby enhance
their own opportunities to mate. But when raiders abduct women and leave

                                           harm the infant as to prevent it from clinging
                                            to her. Free of her encumbrance, she leaves
                                           the infant alone. Fortunately, an abandoned
                                           baby is picked up within minutes by either
                                           the mother or another allomother. (Sarah

behind or savagely kill unweaned infants, they often do. What then? Are these
men expressing infanticidal tendencies such as those that evolved in other
primates? It has the same outcome as infanticide does in other primates. Does
this mean that the killing of infants by such men is homologous-that is, sim­
ilar in its mechanisms and evolutionary origins-to infanticide by raiding
males in other animals?
    Some cultural anthropologists dismiss such behaviors as infanticide during
war as pathological, produced by colonial transformations of otherwise
peaceful tribal worlds. Some dismiss all forms of murder as idiosyncratic or
deranged. 8 They assume evidence from other species is irrelevant because
animals have no symbolic culture. They assume that infanticide, to the extent
that it is really going on, must be due to culturally constructed attitudes that
condone brutality.
    Yet the earliest evidence we have, from the Iliad and other ancient narra­
tives, suggests that raiding goes way hack. New assessments of archaeological
evidence (recently and cogently summarized in Lawrence Keeley's H{Jr Bifore
Civilization) convinces me that men have always engaged in intergroup con­
flict over access to resources, just as males do in other primates using less
elaborate or calculated means.
    Intertribal conflict is very ancient, and fertile females arc among the
resources likely to he competed for. 9 Clearly, animal cYidcnce is relevant. Th<.'
difficulty comes in trying to be specific about just how it is relevant. Just why
docs the capture of mothers put their children at such horrifying risk? It is
had enough that infants arc often forcibly left behind to starve. Worse still is

the propensity of some raiders to deliberately kill a vulnerable child that is no
immediate threat to them. The matter is problematic not just because the
beha,·ior is gruesome and the evidence sketchy, but also because we know so
little about the mechanisms involved.
     Ohsen·ing phenomena like lactational suppression of ovulation, we
understand fairly well how innate neuro-endocrinological feedback loops
adjust birth intenals in primates. The mechanisms work the same way in a
langur as in a human. So long as the mother's infant suckles frequently, ovula­
tion is suppressed, although nutrition and energy expenditure arc also rele­
vant variables. The outcome is birth intervals compatible with both infant
survival and maternal success over a long breeding career. It is far less clear
what, if anything, is the same when a strange male appropriating a female kills
her infant. We don't know if, at a physiological level, brutal monkeys and
brutal men are motivated in anything like the same way.
     Rational Actors Can Also Behave Like Brutes
One of the most reliable accounts of infanticide by tribal raiders comes from
Elena Valero, a Brazilian woman kidnaped by Yanamamo warriors when she
                            MOTHERS        AND           ALLOMOTHERS
Fig. 1 o. 3 Today the term "trophy wife" is likely to crop up in a Gary Trudeau cartoon about the
glamorous young wife of an aging, self-important CEO.But in the past such trophies were a pri­
mary objective of warfare. In this vase painting from 48o B.c. the commander-in-chief of the
Greek army, Agamemnon, commandeers the most beautiful of their recent captives from his
lieutenant, Achilles. Agamemnon leads Briscis away by the wrist in the time-honored gesture
denoting both "taking possession of" and the marriage union. "She trailed on hchind, reluctant,
every step...        "adds Homer. "Women arc the constant cause of war,"said Darwin, and the stronger
"carries off the prize." Friedrich Engels concurred: "In Homer young women arc booty and arc
handed m·cr to the pleasure of the conquerors," he wrote, "the handsomest being picked oil' hy the
commanders in order of rank."10 (:luic reJ:fioure skJ•phos atrribur�J ro ,lfakron anJ •iOIItd hy 1/�eron on one handle, cour·

was eleven years old at a time when inteJ-trihal warfare and raiding for
women was still endemic in the forested region between the Upper Orinoco
 River and the Upper Rio Negro. No sooner was she kidnaped than Elena
Valero's captors, Kohoroshiwetari Yanamamo, were themselves attacked hy
rival Yanamamo, the Karawetari. Again Elena was taken captive and handed
over to one of her abductors as a wife. She would spend the next twenty years

Fig. 1 o ·4 Rumored atrocities against children outnumber accurate eyewitness accounts. Yet many
wartime attacks on children are all too real. The Bible (Exodus                1: 16) tells us Pharaoh com­
manded Shiphrah, Puah, and the other Hebrew midwives to kill all male children at birth. Much
later, King Herod "sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all its bor­
ders from two years old and under" (Matthew 2: 16). Assuming it's true, why should Herod kill
infants of no immediate threat to him? (fhe Slaying nr the lnnnl"<'Jlts, Nicholas Poumn, I I 594-1665]. Phorcsraphit

among the Karawetari, marry twice with different captors and bear three
children before finally escaping. She would witness, and hear about, many
more raids. But none were so horrifying as the second one:
     They killed so many. I was weeping for fear and for pity, but there was
    nothing I could do. They snatched the children from their mothers to
     kill them, while the others held the mothers tightly by the arms and
     wrists as they stood up in a line. All the women wept.
                  MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    Elena Valero and the other women fled before the raiders, taking their
children with them. Were mothers with babies victimized because they were
especially vulnerable, or were they specifically targeted? With case and
absolute callousness, one of the Karawetari raiders "took the baby by his feet
and bashed him against the rock. His head split open and the little white
brains spurted out on the stone."
   When much later, anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon interviewed differ­
ent Yanamamo groups, people told him about women being kidnaped, their
infants merely left behind to starve. But in Elena Valero's account, the
children of captured women-and especially sons-were very deliberately
targeted:
   the men began to kill the children; little ones, bigger ones, they killed
   many of them. They tried to run away, but [the Karawetari raiders]
   caught them, and threw them to the ground, and stuck them with
   bows, which went through their bodies and rooted them to the
   ground. Taking the smallest by the feet, they beat them against the trees
   and the rocks. The children's eyes trembled. Then the men took the
   dead bodies and threw them among the rocks, saying, "Stay there, so
   that your fathers can find you and eat you."
   Elena Valero goes on to describe how mothers tried in vain to engage the
raiders in conversation and dissuade them from killing their offspring. One
woman pleaded, "It's a little girl, you mustn't kill her." Another gambled des­
perately to save the life of a two-year-old snatched from her arms by telling
the raider, "Don't kill him, he's your son. The mother was with you and she
ran away when she was already pregnant with this child. He's one of your
sons!"The man pauses as he mulls over this possibility before replying, "No,
he's [another group's) child. It's too long since [that woman was) with us."
                                                                           11
The man then took the baby by his feet and bashed him against the rocks.
Grisly recollections, whether they derive from the Yanamamo or Bosnia, raise
special problems. "Rational actors" seem to behave as brutally as chimps,
eliminating other males and old females, carrying off fertile females, killing
immatures, and (like chimps and langurs) especially targeting immature
              T H E  0 I' T I M A L N U M HE R    0 I' FAT H E R S             243
males.11 Some sociobiologists, like Hanard's Richard Wrangham, attribute
similarities between human and simian genocide (and he uses that term for
both) to common genetic attributes in both that cause males to behave in
a "demonic" way. Some evolutionary psychologists propose that humans
e\·oh-ed distinct psychological mechanisms, or "modules in the brain for
homicide."'' But so far these arc speculations.
    Tlw argument that infanticide can be attributed to the common heritage
of chimps and humans, who share 98 pet·cent of their genetic material
(\Vrangham's homology argument), is weakened by the fact that honobo
males also share 98 percent of their genetic material with humans yet have
(so far) never been reported to behave in quite so "demonic" a manner. How­
e,·er, as bonobo specialists Amy Parish and Frans de Waal point out, one rca­
son bonobos do not engage in infanticide is because even though females do
not remain among kin, the strong alliances that females forge with other
females make mothers too formidable.14
    Gorilla males, like chimps, share nearly 98 percent of their genes with
men, and they, too, are highly infanticidal. Yet infanticide by gorillas is a soli­
tary acth·ity, not the demonic \vork of males in groups. At the same time,
equh·alently "demonic" patterns (infanticide, perhaps special targeting of
male infants) can be found in more distantly related monkeys like langurs,
who share with humans only about 9 2 percent of their genetic material.15 It is
not clear what we are dealing with here.
    Some suspect (and I agree) that superficially similar patterns in men's
beha,·ior derh·e from a much more open-ended program than in other pri­
mates. Humans endowed with similar general motivations and emotions have
only so many practical options for solving similar problems they confront, so
they com·ergc on the same solution as other primates. Human raiders com­
mit similarly brutal acts as gorilla, chimp, or langur males. But men con­
sciously evaluate costs and benefits, as well as future consequences of their
actions. They calculate contingencies: How much more slowly, for example,
are mothers burdened by infants likely to travel? What are the chances that a
son spared will grow up to aYenge his father? Might these children be useful
alh·e?
    Yanamamo articulate their unwillingness to share resources with the off­
spring of others. They have learned through observation that the fiercer they
arc, the more other Yanamamo-enemics, comrades, and women they seck
to control- --fear and respect them. Yet they worry out loud about fears that
                   MOTHERS         AND      ALLOMOTHERS
other men will retaliate or engage in the same sort of atrocities. As Elena
Valero witnessed, some men talk to mothers whose infants they arc about to
kill, rationalizing their actions. One raider even performs some quick arith­
metic to assess the woman's claim that one of his comrades might be the
father of the infant he is about to lcill. The calculus of Hamilton's rule ( C < Br)
is ingrained not just in his genes but in his memes-in learned tribal values
that are not just a matter of genetic influences, as in wasps, but are part of
the way he is predisposed to look at the world. 16 Nevertheless, by killing
these infants, their mothers' captors eliminate an encumbrance on the trip
home, and are likely to increase their own opportunities to mate and sire off­
spring. In the long term, such actions will increase their group's access to
resources-something else they are consciously aware of.
    My own guess is that the behavior of infanticidal men is homologous to
that of their primate cousins in only the most general sense. They are moti­
vated to strive for status, to compete for access to females, to avoid invest­
ing in unrelated infants, to adopt patterns of behavior more likely to en­
hance than to decrease long-term inclusive fitness. The specific similarities,
then, are merely analogous solutions to common problems these variously
endowed animals confront.
    But even as we acknowledge that we don't really know the reason, I think
we can conclude that women have always had a problem with unrelated men
behaving savagely toward their children. Sometimes there is nothing mothers
can do about it. Other times there is.
    The Importance of Him Being Earnest
Women are not peafowl, looking for peacocks who provide nothing beyond
their genes. Nor are they cockroaches, nor butterflies on the prowl for pack­
ets of nutrients that males deliver along with their sperm. Human females
can't afford to be so single-minded as to look just for the father with the "best
genes" or even the guy who momentarily offers the most resources. Few evo­
lutionists would argue that a mother will be indifferent to signals indicating
the appropriateness or genetic quality of their mates. But, frankly, my dear, in
a species like ours, maternal decisions have to go beyond genes. If a man
inseminates and decamps, and the resulting infant dies prior to weaning, well
before any heritable traits from the father have a chance to he expressed,
their excellence is of no consequence.

    Not long ago, in the most extensive study of its kind, women in more than
thirty countries were asked to •·ank the traits they would most value in a hus­
band. After"mutual attraction" (which may include subconsciously registered
cues about mate quality, body size, and ability to protect her) women
attached the highest priority to traits like "dependable character,""emotional
                        . "                                                 "

                                                            .
    Several things about how such criteria would have played out in a hunter­
gatherer world like Nisa's arc worth noting. First of all, just reaching adult­
hood offers some measure of quality control; fools rarely managed it.
Furthermore, women often chose between closely related men. In Nisa's
case, her lover was a full brother to her husband, both men carrying many of
the same genes. Is it really so surprising, then, in a species where allomater­
nal care matters so much, that Nisa, like the majority of women in the inter­
national suney, ranked reliability above good looks, good health, physical
performance, or other indicators linked to specific genes? Even material
resources paled beside good sense-a composite of innate temperament (no
doubt at some level influenced by genes), upbringing, and life experiences.
    There is considerable evidence from a wide range of societies that women
exchange sexual favors for material resources, and that in societies where
males control access to such resources, women commonly marry for money.
Yet "financial prospects" still ranked twelfth on the international list of
fa,·ored attributes. 171n the Pleistocene, hunting success was erratic, and there
was no wealth to possess . Hence modern preoccupations with "how to marry
a millionaire" strike me as recent, closer to ten thousand than to a million
years old. Marrying for wealth is an artifact of patriarchal societies and their
aftermath, where powerful men (or patrilines) monopolize access to the
resources women need to rear their young.
    In such societies, union with a wealthy man may indeed be a promising
route to secure status and even reproductive success. But among foragers,
who have no alimony, reliability in a husband was a trait worth considering.
So were such contingency plans as a mother could make ahead of time,
should she have reason to fear that her mate might let her down.
    When Should Mothers Line Up More Than One "Father"?
When loss of a parent is a real risk, survival is hand-to-mouth, and mothers
would be hard put to provide alone for progeny, why should mothers confine
                   MOTHERS          AND    ALLOMOTHERS
themselves to just one mate, if by mating with several they increase their off­
spring's survival chances? If the logic here sounds out of character for
humans-creatures we have reason to think spent much of their evolutionary
history in primarily one-male breeding systems-consider the Western tra­
dition of asking trusted friends and especially influential people to serve as
"godparents." The goal is to line up fictive parents who, if needed, will look
out for your offspring. But beyond symbolic designation of godfathers, why
not offer them some tangible, real probability of paternity? In some parts of
the world, sexual liaisons are part of the way a mother sets up networks of
well-disposed men to help protect and provision her offspring.
The area of lowland Amazonia that today spans northern Brazil and Venezuela
down to Paraguay has long been a patchwork of forested tracts and vast
stretches of traversiblc savanna, unbroken by any natural geographic barrier.
This land is occupied today by huntcr-horticulturalists belonging to language
groups that have long since diverged as tribal groups went their separate
ways. In addition to fish and meat, these tribes today still live on manioc that
women grow in temporary gardens. Along with a similar lifestyle, these peo­
ple still share the ancient belief that a baby is sired by more than one man, a
biological fiction anthropologists refer to as "partible paternity." That is,
fetuses arc thought to be built up over time, like the luster on pearls, by
repeated applications of semen . It is a system of belief (if men buy into it) that
benefits mothers and children at the expense of any one male's certainty of
paternity.
    No matter whom they arc studying, anthropologists begin by collecting
genealogies, then classify people by type of kinship system . W hen Kim Hill
asked the Ache who their fathers were, however, he found he needed to
expand his termniology. Three hundred and twenty-one Ache listed a total of
632 fathers. That is an average of almost two "fathers" each. As in many
tribes-including the Cancla, Mundurucu, and Mehinaku of Brazil, the Bari
and Yanamamo of Venezuela       · -the Ache believe fetuses are a composite prod­
uct of scwral different men with whom the mother had sexual relations.
Hence the Ache have a word, miarc, for "the father who put it in"; pcroarc, for
"the men who mixed it"; momboarc, for "the ones who spilled it out"; and
bykuarc, for "the fathers who provided the child's essence." Men who provided

Fig. 1 o. 5' The ceremonial designation of godparents who stand beside the parents at baptism is a
time-honored way for parents to imprm·e their child's prospects in life. We often call these peo­

the mother with meat while the baby was forming arc seen as especially likely
                                             18
to ha,·e given the child its essence.
     In addition to the mother's husband, who is the socially designated father,
a baby can be born with additional, secondary, fathers, who share some obli­
gation to support this child as he or she matures. The Mchinaku joke about
this joint paternity, referring to it as an "all-male collective labor project."
     All men with whom a woman had sex when she became pregnant, and
including the period just prior to when she was detectably pregnant, arc
expected to provide food for her child. Hence, it is scarcely surprising that
just as soon as she suspects she is pregnant, a Cancla woman, like a groupie
after a rock star, attempts to seduce the tribe's best hunters and fishermen.
This is a slightly different way of thinking about why the best hunters might
get the most lovers. Arc they out-competing other men for reproductive suc­
cess, or incurring more obligations? Probably both.
     In any event, this extra provisioning may explain why Bari children with
several fathers ha,·e measurably better survival chances. According to anthro­
pologist Stephen Beckerman, only 64 percent of the 6 �8 Bari children who

edge, a child can be born with one or more fathers. These "godfathers" arc expected to give gifts
of meat and other help to the child, and arc critical for the survival of any child who is orphaned.
(Courwy '![Maadalena Hurtado and Kim llill)
had no secondary fathers survived to age fifteen, compared with 8o percent
of the     1 94 children who did. Singly fathered children born to the same
mother did not survive as well as did their multiply fathered siblings. Among
the Ache, Hill observed that children with just one father received less help,
but when a mother lined up too many fathers, the extreme uncertainty of
paternity dissuaded all candidates from helping. Children identified as having
one primary and one secondary father had the best survival rates.19
The optimal numhcr of fathers under these demographic and subsistence
conditions appears to be two. Arc husbands jealous? Among the Ache, men
deny it, but then later beat their wives. Not surprisingly, Ache mothers try to
convince possible fathers that the club is more exclusive than it really is.
Among the matrilineal and matrilocal Cancla, where women have more say,
there seems to be less need for discretion. Anthropologist William Crocker
of the Smithsonian, who has studied the Cancla for many years, is convinced

that husbands arc not jealous. Whether or not Cancla husbands are telling the
truth about not minding, they join with other group members in encouraging
wives to honor the custom. In what may be one of the more extreme cases on
record, unusual for hominids, ritual sex with twenty or more men during all­
community ceremonies left some Canela mothers with an array of candidates

for "fatherhood
    \Vith resources unpredictable and often scarce, in environments where
high adult male mortality makes divorce and widowhood likely, husbands may
see merit to their wives' infidelity. There is the insurance factor and also
enhanced social cohesion. Friendship is a widespread, if little remarked, ratio­
nale for wife-sharing among peoples such as the Eskimo, or among ritual
age-mates in parts of eastern and southern Africa where men share wives
with real or fictive brothers. Husbands turn a blind eye, appreciating that the
well-being of children whom they are fond of (and also have the best chance of
ha\'ing fathered because they had regular sexual access to the mother) is at
       21
stake.
In a traditional Canela marriage ceremony, the bride and groom lie down on
a mat, arms under each other's heads, legs entwined. The brother of each
partner's mother then comes forward. He admonishes the bride and her new
husband to stay together until the last child is grown, specifically reminding
them not to be jealous of each other's lovers. Survival of a mother's children
takes priority over a man's exclusive sexual access to his wife. The Canela
have taken the "touch of polyandry" that crops up so often in the mating
behavior of other primates, justified and legitimized it through ideology, and
magnified its significance many times over through ritual. But the system is a
fragile one. When the Canela come into contact with outsiders, Canela men

    Mother-centered societies like the Canela fare poorly when they come
into contact with more patriarchal ones. The freedom to whcel-and-deal,
which allows Canela and Bari mothers considerable leeway in negotiating for
child support, is the antithesis of patriarchal marriage, which, as Marxist the­
orist Friedrich Engels pointed out years ago, was devised with "the express

2)0                MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
patriarchal husbands translate ownership of the means of production into
"ownership" of wives; "should the wife recall the old form of sexual life and
attempt to revive it," Engels wrote, "she is punished." The "patriarchial con­
straints" hypothesis receives support from such limited evidence we now
have about misattributed paternity: rates are extremely low, less than 1 per­
cent in the most patriarchal family systems and as high as 1 o to 2o percent in
some underclass populations or in partible paternity cultures like the Yana­
mamo.23
    Matrilineal descent systems disappear as soon as farming becomes inten­
sive, when plows, livestock, and paid employment are introduced, and irriga­
tion systems built. But the possibility of mother-centered lifestyles is latent,
and always there, reinvented all the time when resources become unpre­
dictable, adult male mortality rates go up, or whenever it becomes impru­
dent for a mother to rely on protection or provisioning from a single man.
    Across the shantytowns of South America, in African townships, in urban
underclasses of both hemispheres, along with some tribal groups like the
Canela, wherever husbands prove unreliable providers and male patrilines do
not have so tight a hold as to make such tactics dangerous, mothers massage
the networks of possible paternity. Socially, marriage is monogamous, but
mothers form polyandrous sexual liaisons with several "fathers" to elicit such
contributions as these men can provide. "Why put all your eggs in one bas­
ket?" quipped one modern Zambian woman, by way of justification for what
struck her interviewer as an exploitative attitude toward men. The woman
had good reason to ponder the question-for, like a Hadza hunter who just
killed an eland, if the father of her children encounters a sudden windfall, he
may usc it to cultivate ties with other women rather than provisioning her
and her children. 24
    "Breakdown" of the Nuclear Family Scarcely New
There is a tendency among politicians and moralists on the right to decry the
"demise" of the nuclear family, as if this were some new cataclysm brought
about by the loosening of sexual mores in the wake of birth control. Some­
times feminism and sexual liberation arc specifically blamed, as in a recent
editorial in the Wall Street Journal titled: "Feminism Isn't Antisex. It's Only
Anti family." The more promiscuous women arc, the less interest men will

     Meanwhile critics from the ldt assume the breakdo\\'11 of the family must
be due to capit.1list, racist, m· <.·olonialist oppt·cssion. This at least is more
accurate insofar as such forces contribute to high male m<wtality rates and

     Is a Fraction of a Father Ever Preferable
     to a Whole One?
Of course the breeding sy stem hest suited to the goose will often look differ­
ent from the one preferred by the gander. Polygynous arrangements where
one male monopolizes sexual access to as many females as he can afford,
sequestering them from other males, keeping them all for himsc1f, is a
common goal of many male animals. In patriarchal human societies, men
usc alliances with patrilineal kin-fathers and brothers-to achieve this goal.
One way for patrilines to control w omen is to gain control over the resources
that mothers need to sun·h·c and reproduce.
     "Fraternal interest groups," whether based on real or fictive kin alliances,
constitute the business end of patriarchy. Such alliances arc particularly likely
to prc,·ail where raiding or feuding is common and where, therefore, men arc
essential to protect property, w omen, and progeny. The greater competitive­
ness of men in groups is the main reason why patrilocal marriage systems
proliferated along with the cow, the plow, and denser populations these last

ten thousand vears.
               "
     In such societies, male interests and priorities arc giYen more \veight than
maternal ones, w ith the result that high fertility (quantity) often takes prece­
dence m·cr child well-being (quality).
By the time late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century anthmpologists began to
collect information about residence patterns in dill<.·rcnt cultures, the major-
                  MOTHERS           AND   ALLOMOTHERS
ity of cultures were already patrilocal. That is , some 70 percent of human
societies were living in male philopatric arrangements. About two-thirds of
these patrilocal societies have patrilineal descent groups, and most are polyg­
ynous. Matrilineal cultures like the Canela, which reckon descent through
the mother, emerge only among people living matrilocally. Such matrilineal
arrangements are fragile, and they quickly disappear after contact with patri­
lineal herders, agriculturalists, or wage economies . A mid-twentieth-century
survey revealed 15 percent of the world's cultures were matrilineal, and they
were becoming scarcer. 27
    A matrilineal society is not the same as a "matriarchal" one-the inverse
of a patriarchal society in which powerful matrilines maintain public and pri­
vate social control. Indeed, outside of myth, I know of no evidence that any
matriarchal society ever existed. However, there is general agreement among
anthropologists that women living matrilocally among their kin tend to have
more autonomy than when they do not. Such women are likely to have many
more opportunities to take advantages of devices such as the fiction of "part­
ible paternity." By contrast, the whole thrust of patriarchal societies is to
guarantee powerful men certainty of paternity. Especially in patriarchal soci­
eties that are also polygynous, mothers have relatively little freedom of
choice, and, once mated, have access to only a fraction of the paternal invest­
ment that a man divides among the offspring of multiple wives. How, then,
do men convince women to accept a breeding system so far from optimal for
the well-being and survival of her children?
    Elaborate modes of socialization, rituals, and whole mythologies have
grown up to endorse male control over the inconvenient sexual legacy that
women inherited from their primate predecessors. Among the more com­
mon myths of patriarchy is the claim that patriarchal polygynous family
structures actually benefit women. It is a myth that social scientists them­
selves occasionally help to perpetuate.
It was George Bernard Shaw who first popularized the notion that polygyny
henefits women when he claimed that "the maternal instinct leads a woman
to prefer a tenth share in a first rate man to the exclusive possession of a third
rate one"- -a claim reaffirmed over the years by Nobel Prize-winning
economist Gary Becker in his Treatise on the Family, along with a host of
               T H E 0 I' T I M A L N li 1\1 B E R 0 I' F A T 1-1 E R S     253
cmlution-mindcd social scientists. When evolutionary biologist Robert
Tri,·ers proYocath·cly inquired of Harvard anthropologist Irvcn DeVore
whether polygynous marriages-       in which women get only a fraction of a
husband instead of a whole one-weren't just a "male chauvinist fantasy in
which males of strength and status give vent to their basest sexual appetites
and reproductiYe drives?" DeVore replied:
    That is the judgement of most people in our society, and it's heavily
    reinforced by church, state and cultural values. But in most cultures,
    women would be furious if a law were passed that decreed they could
    not become the second, third or sixth wife of a wealthy, high-status
    male when the alternative was a monogamous union with a poor, low­
                 28
    status male.
    DeVore's logic-frequently echoed among those evolutionary psycholo­
gists who assume that patriarchy is the natural, species-typical state for
humans-deriwd from a classic study of red-winged blackbirds conducted
by a founding father of behavioral ecology, Gordon Orians. Polygyny in
blackbirds is not maintained by males preventing other males from getting
ncar fertile females, but rather by males first monopolizing the resources that
females need to breed. Each breeding season a male drives away male com­
petitors, establishes his own "territory," and then sits back to see which
females settle there.
    By contrast with males in "female defense polygyny," in this "resource
defense polygyny," males vie for territories and then females come along and
"decide" whether their interests arc best served by being the first mate of a
male on a "poor" territory, or the polygynously mated wife of a male on a
"rich" one. Since females were the ones choosing between males, the exis­
tence of"female choice" seemed to confirm that a female derives more bene­
fit from becoming the second wife (or mistress) of a resource-rich male
rather than sole wife of a poor one, or a female who never gains access to any
territory at all. (Resource-defense polygyny, though originally modeled for
birds, was subsequently applied to humans by John Hartung, and this model
was confirmed in a study of the Kipsigis people of Kenya by Moniquc Borger­
hoff Mulder.)29
    So is this true? Do women benefit from polygyny-and, more to the
point, do mothers? The answer all depends on what a woman's options arc.
                  MOTHERS          AND   ALLOMOTHERS
Obviously, if men monopolize all the possible niches for breeding and all the
sources of production, so that the only way a female gets access to the
resources she needs to breed is by joining him and his other wives on his ter­
ritory on his terms, polygyny is her best option.
    If male resource control is a given, then yes, a mother accepting male
terms is better off than if she produced young without a territory and she and
her young all starved. (As nineteenth-century Darwinian feminist Eliza Burt
Gamble worked it out for her own society a century ago, "the female of the
human species is obliged to captivate the male in order to secure her sup­
port.")�0 Similarly, a mother surrounded by roving bands of marauders is bet­
ter off with a powerful protector. But in either case, her choice is scarcely
unconstrained . Hence, to argue that a woman is better off as mistress to a
wealthy man than as the sole wife of a poor one ignores other alternatives,
including the possibility that the woman might be protected by kin, by law, or
given the same access to resources that men have through patrimonies or
access to remunerative work.
    No doubt, when men monopolize resources, a woman may sometimes be
better off polygynously mated to the wealthiest. But for several of the best­
studied polygynous societies, even when there are major disparities between
husbands in terms of wealth, a mother who ends up with a fraction of a rich
man is not better off than one who has access to all of a poor one. Part of the
reason is the competition between mothers that the situation generates. The
Dogan of Mali, one of the best-studied polygynous groups, illustrate just how
high the costs to mothers and children can go when male interests take prior­
ity over maternal ones.
    When Mothers Compete for a Fraction of a Father
The Dagon are West African millet farmers. Although unusual for Africa, a
continent with many matrilineal societies, their classically patriarchal family
system has many parallels with societies in Asia and, to a lesser extent, the
Western world. (By patriarchal in this discussion I mean societies with
patrilocal residence, patrilineal inheritance, and male-biased institutions,
including preferential inheritance of property by sons.)
    Polygyny among the Do gon-as in other patriarchal societies--occurs
hand in hand with various means of monitoring female sexuality. Each
woman's menstrual cycle is open to public scrutiny. By custom, as soon as she
               THE    OPTIMAL       NUMBER       Of fATHERS                 2 )�
detects bleeding, a woman must relocate to a special hut. (Such practices arc
documented in about 1 2 percent of tribal societies.)
    Countering millions of years of evolution, the Dogon have bt'come a cul­
ture where ovulation cannot he concealed. Failure to comply with the rules,
especially cheating (pretending to menstruate when a woman is actually
pregnant), brings social reprisals in the real world, and the prospect of worse
punishments in the supernatural one. In this way, a man can be confident that
any woman he marries is not already pregnant by another man.
                                                                  ll
    In addition to menstrual monitoring, ancient female incentives for confus­
ing paternity arc countered by removing each girl's clitoris. T he Dogon take
it for granted that after clitorodectomy a woman will find sexual intercourse
outside marriage less tantalizing, not worth the risks. In this way, older men
with se,·eral young wives can be as certain of paternity as any primates in the
world-Dogon certain.
    Docs certainty of paternity ensure that Dogon men invest more in their
children? Not necessarily, especially not if they have several wives and many
sons. As in most patriarchal societies, a man's attention tends to be focused
on gaining and maintaining prestige, with its corollary of more wives and
more children.
    Ty pical for this area, child mortality among the Dogon is very high.
According to anthropologist Beverly Strassmann, 46 percent will die before
age fi,·e. What is more noteworthy, though, is that the chances of a child
dying are seven to eleven times higher if the mother is living in a poly gy ­
nous family, working together with and sharing meals with cowives, than if
she is married monogamously. In a monogamous union, a mother's loss is
equally the father's. But in the case of a man married to three wives, the
poly gy nist comes out ahead reproductively even if more than half his chil­
dren die.32
    Unlike a mother's goal, which is generally "quality," well-spaced, healthy
offspring, each one well provided for, the Dogon's father's goal is "quan­
tity"-as many children as he can have, even if many die. Among the Dogon,
this is particularly unfortunate, because land is increasingly in short supply,
and men can bequeath a homestead only to one select son, or to a couple of
sons. Yet men have little incentive to take fewer wives. For women work
hard. Owning them confers prestige, a higher standard of living, and repro­
ductive success.

                                      more information all we can conclude is that fertile
                                      females were of interest then just as they are today.
                                      Similar representations ranging from great art to
                                      obvious pornography are found in societies with
                                      very different degrees of female autonomy. This
                                      statue of a young woman just past menarche comes
                                      from an intensely patriarchal society, the Dogon of
                                      West Africa, where men hold political power and
                                      usc it to quite effectively monitor and control
                                      female sexuality. Statues such as this one are dis­
                                      played at the funerals of powerful men to symbol­
                                      ize their ability to to possess such a woman. (Cou"''J'
                                      �the Metropolitan Museum �Arr, New York)
    Strassmann is candid about not knowing for sure what causes higher mor­
tality among children-especially sons-born to polygynously married
mothers. But Dagon mothers themselves are unequivocal: they claim that
their sons arc being poisoned by cowives. Strassmann was invited to attend
rituals at which masked dancers intimidate women to deter wives from such
nefarious pursuits. Indeed, wild-sounding accusations about children poi­
soned by cowives can be extensively documented in Malian court records.
Occasionally women actually confess to poisoning a rival's child. 33 But why
primarily sons? Because daughters leave home when they marry, and it is sons
who are favored, and who remain at home to compete with their father's
other sons for inheritances of scarce land.
    Why don't wives married to the same man manage to cooperate more? In
some societies, they do, especially if the husband marries sisters. Among Aus­
tralian Aborigines, wise men often seek to marry wives who arc related to
C'ach other precisely because such women arc known to get along better. 14
But among the Dogon, the benefits of reduced strife do not outweigh the
benefits to the patriarch of discouraging his wives from forming alliances. The
               THE    OPTIMAL         NUMBER       01'  I'ATIIERS            2)7
patriarch's strategy is to "divide and conquer." Strassmann notes that sisters
and other related women arc spcc!fically prohibited from man·ying into the
same patrilinc. Such strictures make it hard to sustain the functionalist argu­
ment that these polygynous families arc set up fm the common good, with
eugenic intent to promote the well-being of all concerned. In a world where
the optimal number of fathers per child is pretty obviously at least one, not
some fraction of one, most Dogon men still aspire to he polygynists .
    Conflicting Maternal and Paternal Interests
In literature, conflicting interests between the sexes is a theme as old as the
Greek myths, yet few ha\'e zeroed in on the key issue quite so pointedly as the
brilliant, troubled, and utterly misogynist Swedish playwright August Strind­
berg. In his 1 88 7 play The Father, the wife of the patriarch (merely identified
as "the captain") torments him with the possibility that their only child may
not have been his. Lashing out in helpless rage, the captain exclaims, "If it's
true we are descended from the apes, it must have been from two different
species !males and females). There's no likeness between us, is there?"
    Writing about the same time, the Swiss-German jurist Johann Bachofen
decided that some of the myths about ancient matriarchies overturned by
men were not just stories but real history. His anthropological classic Das
Mutterrecht (The Mother Right) traced successive stages of human cultural
eYolution . He began with an imagined primeval state when all people lived in
matrilineal societies, followed by a second stage characterized by a bonobo­
like interlude of "primitive promiscuity." These were mother-centered
"·orlds, at the opposite extreme from patriarchal worlds like the Dogon's,
which Bachofen viewed as the third and final stage of cultural evolution.
    As anthropologists read the evidence today, however, there is no support
for the notion of successive stages in human evolution, and even less support
for the prior existence of matriarchies. Ancient myths about an age when
women ruled, only to be usurped and put in their proper place by men, are
not so much history as reflections of the chronic tensions between paternal
and maternal interests. Themes about men overthrowing female rule are
rampant in the origin myths of ancient Greece, Amazonia, and the ancient
Near East. This docs not mean events like those described ever happened, but
rather that conflicting interests between males and females, matrilineal and
patrilineal interests, arc perpetually at work.
                  MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    These tensions derive from the ongoing dialectic between mothers who
seek the optimal breeding situation for themselves and fathers who strive to
counter them and impose their own ideal conditions. Monogamy happens
to be an unusually stable compromise, in part because it raises survival
prospects for children. The alternative to monogamy is for matters to sort
themselves out so as to favor the sex with the most leverage, usually males.
When one sex is forced to accept a breeding arrangement that is grossly dis­
advantageous, as many women in patriarchal societies must, what prevents
mothers from defecting?This is where myth and ideology come in.
    Convincing Mothers to Accept Poor Terms
How might a female primate be persuaded to accept sequestered breeding
arrangements that may compromise her health and nutrition and diminish
her reproductive success? Why would a female primate ever give up such
hard-won assets as concealed ovulation, or collaborate in the removal of the
clitoris of her daughters? How to convince women to restrict their selection
of mates to just one male and pressure her to breed at shorter intervals than
might be optimal for her health and give birth to more children than is
healthy for her? How do males manage to maintain a one-male breeding sys­
tem, especially one that is not monogamous and in which females receive so
little paternal investment care in return? How are mothers persuaded to
make do with only a fraction of a father, and not necessarily even one of their
own choosing?
    One widely employed solution, found among gorillas and hamadryas
baboons, is to threaten with physical violence any female who resists, or, like
langurs and chimps, to make it so risky for infants of mothers short on male
defenders that mothers cannot afford to refuse their offer of protection. 35
Such rudimentary versions of patriarchal mating systems probably character­
ized some (many? ... most?) early hominid populations. Full-fledged
patriarchy, such as the Dogon developed, is more recent. It depends upon
constraints far more insidious than just out-manning daughters and wives.
Patriarchal arrangements like the Dogon's or Victorian Britain's rely for their
persistence upon the invisible constraints that creep inside human imagina­
tions and insinuate themselves into the way men and women conceptualize
who they arc.
    Humankind's unique capacity for symbolic thought brings with it Ian-

guage. Having the ability to talk not only means that people can gossip about
what other people arc doing (and often what is being discussed is the sexual
conduct of women) but that girls will have the ability to inter nalize what
others think and say. For, unique among animals, humans imagine how others
perceire them. Many animals have templates for how they should behave in
order to avoid punishment; even macaques and baboons manage this. But
only among humans do these transactions take on historical and symbolic
dimensions, resonating inside verbal brains as humans strive to avoid disgrace
and achieve honor. Typically, proper sex roles for men include being domi­
nant, or "manly"; for women, being modest, chaste, and, above all, a "good
mother."
    Enforcers of Womanly Modesty
In addition to physical constraints, phalanxes of supernatural creatures work
overtime inside human imaginations to convince women living in the real
world to comply with gender norms. Among the Maya-speaking maize farm­
ers of southern Mexico and Central America, women are afraid to go out
unchaperoned, especially at night, and with good reason. Among the Tzotzil
Maya, women fear the hl.k'al, a small super-sexed demon with a several-foot­
long penis modeled rather distantly on Cama Sotz, the large-tcsticled ancient
vampire bat from the Popul Vuh (the central Mayan religious text) whose
practice it was to zip down from the sky and decapitate people.
   Today, this fearsome creature, too horrible to mention by name lest he
come, confines himself to seizing women who behave immodestly or who fail
to respect taboos about menstruation (there are certain activities, like cook­
ing, that menstruating women arc supposed to avoid). The h,1k'al snatches
women, carrying them off to his cave, where he rapes them. A woman
impregnated by the hl.k'al swells up and then gives birth night after night,
until she dies. Not surprisingly, few women are interested in finding out
whether such demons, devils, furies, or hellfire are real or not.
    Did Modesty Evolve?
No one doubts that women behave more modestly than other apes. Women
really are very different in this respect. Women, for example, do not rub their
genitals against a partner of either sex in full view of other people, the way
bonobos do. No grown man or woman is so likely as a chimp to masturbate in

Fig. 1 o.S Once a year at the festival of Carnival held in a Mayan town in southern Mexico calle<l

public, and universally (even where people go mostly naked) there are parts
of the body (especially the genitals) that people would be ashamed for others
to sec. 36 In every culture, no matter how casual about sex, people arc embar­
rassed to be caught in flagrante delicto. In many societies women would blush
just to be suspected of imagining a compromising situation. Being caught, or
even suspected, brings a wave of mortification not unlike (and I am guessing)
a chimp who has just offended a dominant animal or been caught trespassing.
     We women arc incomparably more inhibited than chimps. But when did
this come ahout? And why? Is this diflcrence due to early learning, or has
there been selection through time, such that women lacking modest inclina­
tions died young, heforc they could reproduce? It is unsettling to ponder the

Sclk'nam foragers of Patagonia. According to Selk'nam cosmology, there once was a time when
womcn ruled. This imagined matriarchal order ended when, for the good of society, all the pow­

remain submissive and never again challenge male interests. To this end, once a y ear, men imper­
sonated misogynist demons called "shoorts" and rampaged through camp. Any willful or way­
ward wife was a special target. A shoort, in one of his eight different disguises, went to her hut,
shook it violently, stirred up the hearth, scattered her belongings, and if she looked out, stabbed
her with a sharp stick. 17 The closest contemporary comparison would probably be terrorists

possibility that generations of male domination and claustration of women
have left traces in the human genome.
       However it happened, g irls in every culture learn at an early age to emu­
late suitable behaviors, to speak and dress in appropriate ways. The earliest
written records describing standards of modest conduct for women date
back thousands of years. In preclassical Greece, for example, girls were
brought up to be constantly aware of aidos, a composite concept involving
262                MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
respectful modesty and a self-consciousness about the ever present danger of
sexual shame. Aidos is signaled by a girl's dress, her veil, her downcast eyes,
and the way she handles herself.
    Daughters were sequestered inside the home. None would leave until
they were married. In his play Tereus, Sophocles has homesick Prokne review

    men's homes, others to foreigners' , some to joyless houses, some to

    In ancient Greece, aristocratic women lived their whole lives indoors, lit­
erally in the shadows (as Aristotle noted), their faces veiled from direct view,
their glances averted from men, never looking directly at any man until their
wedding day, when they looked straight into the eyes of their husband to sig­
nify their compliance.
Was all this necessary? Certainly the ancient Greeks thought so. Young girls
w ere identified with bears, and to a lesser extent lions, common enough in
late Pleistocene Greece. Both bears and lions bear multiple young, and any
ancient hunter who chanced to witness a lioness mate would be unlikely to
have forgotten it. Female lions mate as often as every fifteen minutes, day and
night, with anywhere from one to three males, like the wild sexually uninhib­
ited maenads of Greek legend-or Canela women. 39
    For the ancient Greeks, a woman's animal nature lurked at the core of her
being. From early childhood, it was deemed necessary to "tame" her. Homer's
word for "wife," damar, means "broken into submission." Following this train
of thought, fifth-century B.C. comedic playwright Plato Comicus warned that
"if you relax too much, the wife gets out of control." This was a very different
view of female nature from the one that prevailed in Darwin's day. By then,
patriarchy had made such deep inroads into all fields of learning, even natural
history, that it was simply assumed that women "happily for them" have little
lihido.40

    Virtue Transformed into a" Maternal Effect"
Patriarchal cultures, whether among the Dogon, ancient Greeks, or in Asia,
differ in how they define female nature and the most sought-after virtues.
Always, though, virtue comes linked both to chastity and to accepting the
patriarch's assessment of what would constitute the optimal number of mates
for a mother to have: one- -him alone.
    The trick was to convince a woman that being chaste was both in her
interests and the same as being a good mother. A mother will have an obvious
stake in compliance when the status of her offspring depends on her "virtue,"
on how well she measures up to patriarchal standards. From that point on, it
becomes \'cry difficult to tease apart a husband's interests from those of his
wife and her children.
As was true in Victorian England, women in Ching dynasty China-the
eighteenth century's Eastern renaissance, noted for producing women writ­
ers of great merit-were meant to be industrious, devoted to the care of
children and to their husband's parents, and, above all, chaste. A mother's
virtues, it was assumed, rubbed off on her children-as did her vices.
    In Asia, the concept of "maternal effects" was transformed into exquisite
metaphors for women tending the gardens of their virtue in ways that were
transmitted to their children. Chinese mothers were considered so impor­
tant to the early education of scholar sons that writing by women was actually
encouraged and much admired. Historian Susan Mann has pieced together
the cloistered lives and work of these Ching women writers. Their specialty
was writing biographies of "exemplary women ." Most admirable of all were
young women who committed suicide after the death of a fiance, or lived on
as chaste widows who brought honor to their sons.
    As with women's education in England and the United States before the
twentieth century, the intention was for women to become better mothers,
not more educated people. Accomplished or not, it was unthinkable for an
upper-class Ching woman to join men, or even to be seen in public without a
chaperone. Nor was it likely. The bones of her feet were crushed in childhood
and then bound so as to prevent growth. When the period of excruciating
pain was ended, she would only be able to walk supported by maids. Her par­
ents would arrange her marriage, to a man who would treasure her tiny feet,
                    MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
as erotic to him perhaps as trim ankles to Homer, breasts to Americans, but­
tocks to Brazilians, only better, since they guaranteed that his love would be
too crippled to act on any cyclical wanderlust.
    If a daughter or wife expressed ideas judged inappropriate or rebellious,
or behaved so as to attract dishonor, her father or husband had the right to kill
her.Ching daughters who brought shame upon their families (as George Eliot
had upon hers by living openly with an already married man, George Lewes)
would be strangled or hacked to death.14 Little was known in England at that
time about these Chinese literary women, yet Eliot, with her broad-ranging
intellect, felt a natural affinity with Ching women when she wrote:
    You can try ... but ...never imagine ... what it is to have a man's
   force of genius in you, and yet to suffer the slavery of being a girl.To
   have a pattern cut out .. .this is what you must be; this is what you
   are wanted for; a woman's heart must be of such a size and no larger,
   else it must be pressed small, like Chinese feet ....42
    Even when the goal is the survival of a family line, maternal and paternal
interests do not necessarily overlap. Patriarchal societies are those in which
patrilineal interests have, over time and by whatever means, come to prevail
over strictly maternal ones.T he goal is to produce offspring-often many of
them-of undisputed paternity, no matter the cost to their mothers.
Sur veying this dismal scene, a world in which interests of mothers and chil­
dren arc so often subordinated to patrilineal aims, raises a troublesome ques­
tion at a theoretical level.How could a species like Homo sapiens ever evolve?
How could females so clearly at risk of reproductive exploitation be selected
to produce such large-brained, vulnerable, slow-maturing offspring? Why
not instead opt for (or more likely, continue to produce) babies that a mother
could rear by herself-the way chimp mothers do.Although chimp moms
require males for protection from other males, they do not need mates to
provision their young. To me the only possible solution is that humans did not
evolve in mating systems where mothers depended entirely on husbands
to provision them. Otherwise, why wouldn't females he selected for self-

sufficiency-as chimp females have been? Rather unlike other apes, the earli­
est representatives of the genus Homo were cooperative breeders. It's time
then to ask: just who besides mothers subsidized the long, slow development
that is the hallmark of the human species, the very late maturation that distin­
guishes us from every other primate?

    f a Pleistocene father's nagging source of anxiety lay in the past (just who
    did sire his child?), a mother's stretched into the future Hers was a per­ .
    petual, existential angst about who would help provide for her children.
Would her mate survive, stick around, and if he did, how committed would
he be to her children? As tantalizing opportunities came up or as she aged,
would he become involved with other women? We romanticize the past if we
imagine that a mother in the Pleistocene would have been any more certain
about her mate than women arc today. Yet, on her own, it was beyond her
capacity to provide for herself and several otl'spring. Given her predicament,
how much did fathers help? And when they fell short, who else helped?This
inquiry is yielding a new appreciation for an eclectic assortnwnt of allopar­
ents who pnl\'ided mothers the only "safety net" the Pleistocene had to offer.

    New data from extant foragers are y ielding clues that help resolve the
puzzling inconsistency. Human hahies needed more allomatcrnal assistance
than any ape e\·cr before, and needed it far longer. How could a mother so
dependent on assistance from others, y et so uncertain about whether the
father would pro\·ide it, afford to put so much on the line every time she gave
birth? Part of the ans\Ycr lies with a very special ty pe of alloparent-post­
menopausal females, former mothers who lived on not just for a few y ears,
hut for decades after their own last birth. Significantly, these older women
gathered more food than they consumed. New information on just how
much of this surplus postreproductive females may have contributed to the
weaned offspring of others is changing the way some anthropologists think
about the evolution of extra-long human childhoods.
    Contrary to common wisdom, protracted childhoods may not have
emh·ed because they were essential for the development of big brains.
Rather, long childhoods might have been a life-historical by -product of an
organism adapted for a long lifespan. "Grandmaternal" clocks set slow in
anticipation of a long life arc looking like one of several reasons why selection
for greater intelligence came at an evolutionary discount in our species.
    Subsidizing Long Childhoods
All apes mature slowly, but none so slowly as apes belonging to the genus
Homo. Humans take advantage of a long period of dependency by having
brains that grow rapidly after birth, learning to talk, engaging in trial-and­
error experimentation during play, acquiring such skills as tool use, and
absorbing all manner of tribal wisdom. Since Darwin's time it was assumed
that provisioning by increasingly skillful hunters subsidized this leisurely
development. "The most able men," wrote Darwin, "succeeded best in
defending and providing for themselves and for their wives and offspring,"
with the result that more of their children survived, leading to the evolution
of"greater mte
             ·   IIectual vigour and power of mventwn m man."1
                            ·                     ·      ·   ·
    Put another way, we had mao-the-provisioner to thank for both our inven­
th·eness and for the period of grace between birth and maturity . A century
later, this basic hunter-centered scenario is still the most widely accepted
framework for interpreting all incoming evidence. In 1974, the discovery of
the Australopithecus cifarensis fossil Lucy, and shortly afterward the discovery of
footprints left hy three australopithecines walking across volcanic ash 3. 6
268                MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
million years ago, proved beyond doubt that small-brained australopithecine
apes walked upright. On the basis of little more evidence than this, it became
widely accepted that humans became bipedal so fathers could carry food back
to their mates. 2
    By the 198os and 1990s, however, evidence from other primates and
extant hunter-gatherers was challenging the notion that children took longer
to mature because bipedal hunters provisioned mates and dependent young.
As discussed in the last two chapters, paternal agendas were too compli­
cated for any mother to count on her mate's help. Furthermore, such
paleontological evidence as was available (mostly from teeth) provided no
support for the notion that the earliest bipedal hominids, the australo­
pithecines, took longer to mature than other apes. T he earliest evidence for
long childhoods seems to date from Homo erectus, who, according to paleon­
tologist Holly Smith, reached adolescence later than chimps, but not so late
as humans do. At this point, the most reasonable conclusion is that something
other than upright walking and the hypothesized provisioning by fathers
made possible hyper-long Homo sapiens childhoods. 3 When did this occur?
And where did the extra subsidies needed to rear these especially needy off­
spring come from?
    Among hunter-gatherers men are the main source of protein. But this
does not mean that wives of the best hunters receive the most meat. Often, as
in the case of the Ache or the Hadza, meat goes to the group at large, donated
by fathers more interested in "showing off" than providing for their children.
Data from the Ache hint at incentives for doing so: the best hunters report­
edly have the most love affairs. Furthermore, in some of these groups the rca­
son that the offspring of the best hunters arc better fed is not because they
obtain more meat from their fathers, but because the best hunters manage to
marry the most enterprising gatherers. 4
    It was not so much that Darwin and several generations of anthropologists
had been on the wrong track. Rather, there were more tracks than initially
assumed. When anthropologist Frank Marlowe conducted yet another study
of the Hadza, he found that even when men "showed off" hy bagging the most
prestigious game and thereby provisioned the camp at large, more meat
somehow reached children the hunters regarded as their own than reached
their stepchildren. Marlowe concluded that provisioning by men was at least
partly "parenting effort," albeit not always as single-minded and dedicated as
many mothers might hope. To varying degrees, fathers seck to provision their

own and show off. Fortunately for mothers, fathers are not the only providers
mothers depended on.
     There is a proverb African parents dust off when a son comes of age and
sets out to find a wife: "First find yourself a good mother." By "good" they
don't mean having a fine character. Nor are they thinking about heritable
traits that a particularly beautiful or healthy woman might pass on to prog­
eny. By "good" these tipsters have in mind a mother with numerous hard­
 working and well-connected relatives. It is quintessentially good advice for a
cooperative breeder.
      Alloparental Safety Nets
 Anyone who has ever held a new baby knows that it takes two hands and cau­
tious dexterity to support both the baby and his or her floppy head. Com­
pared with baby chimps or baboons, who obligingly hold tight, human babies
do not help much. Yet a mother has no place safe from lurking predators or
stinging insects where she can set her vulnerable charge while she digs for
 roots or picks fruit from branches overhead. Even wearing a sling, a new

mother is bound to he less efficient. How, then, docs she make up the caloric
shortfall between what she can gather and the extra calories a nursing mother
needs for herself and other dependent children?
     Anthropologist Magdalena Hurtado was among the first to show that
deficits were being made up by other women. Among the Ache, foraging
mothers arc immersed in a network of casual, opportunistic, and typically
reciprocal relations involving cowivcs, in-laws, neighbors, and blood-kin. In
some societies-Andaman lslandl·rs in the Indian OCl·an, Solomon Islanders
                                WHO     CARED?                                271
in the Pacific, Efc pygmies landlocked in Central Ali·ica         a mother who
hears another mother's baby whine may offer it her breast. In the Solomon
Islands, taboos pre,·cnt a woman from nursing her baby in the tuber gardens,
so she has to leave her infant with anothct· lactating woman (often a sister-in­
law) while she hoes and han·ests.6
    As in all cooperatiYe breeders, human animals have an internalized emo­
tional calculus predisposing them to protect, care for, and allocate resources
to individuals they classify as kin, their genetic relatives, or those they think
of as kin. Fami1iarity from an early age would be the most common cue,
affection and sympathy the immediate conscious motivations. Whenever
costs of helping arc less than the benefits to their "kin," alloparcnts help. But
calculating Hamilton's simple-sounding terminology of"costs" and"benefits"
can be complicated. All other things being equal, with costs and benefits held
constant, closest kin should help the most. But when were other things ever
equal? Benefits to an infant who gets fed are fairly obvious. But how to calcu­
late the costs to the baby's aunt who provides those benefits?Those costs will
nry with her circumstances. A grandparent, an aunt, and the baby's half­
sibling all share one-quarter of their genes with the infant. Based on degree of
relatedness alone, they should be equally motivated to help. But what if the
aunt has a new baby of her own, or the grandmother is still caring for her last
child, or the half-sibling has recently had malaria and feels weak?
    The most readily available assistance is not necessarily provided by the
closest kin. Fathers are not the only ones with complicated agendas.
    Like, More Available Than Diligent
Around the world, alloparents not yet ready to breed are the working
mother's mainstay. These prereproductives arc available precisely because
they are either physically immature or have not yet"fledged," found a feeding
ground, a "nest site," a job, a mate, or territory-though they arc preparing
to. This last qualification makes them dangerously distractable.7 For such rea­
sons, teenagers may he more available than they are diligent, proficient, or
useful.
    Among some foraging groups, like the Pume of Venezuela, the average
woman will he in her mid-twenties before she starts to gathe1· all the food she
herself consumes, much less the surplus food needed for the children of
other women. Even when they engage in hard work-say, like digging up
tubers-women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four obtain less
2]2                 MOTHERS          AND     ALLOMOTHERS
food per hour than senior women, age forty or more. 8 When food is carried
back to camp (and this may sound all-too-familiar to postindustrial office
workers and soccer moms alike), the hardy young women somehow end up
carrying the lightest loads.
    Typically, adolescent girls gravitate toward easier tasks, such as berry
picking. Childcare is one of these lighter tasks, energetically far less demand­
ing than hacking tubers out of rock-hard soil. But an adolescent's heart may
not be in her work, not even when it's a light task. In an extreme case, ! Kung
kids under fifteen spend less than three minutes an hour in productive labor.
It is as though teenagers are saving themselves for better things-which,
reproductively, of course, they are. Childcare is a job their younger sisters,
mere children themselves, may be more eager to undertake. (If baby dolls are
surprisingly scarce in traditional societies compared to societies with lower
birth rates, it's because little girls have the real thing near at hand. )9
    Modern mothers joke grimly about the narcissism of the young, their self­
absorption, restlessness, and preoccupation with the other sex. From their
point of view, however, girls near menarche are actually hard at work of
another sort, reprogramming their hypothalamus and ovaries, storing up
resources as a down payment on the demanding reproductive career they are
about to embark upon. Adolescents may have expectations and priorities
quite different from those of parents. When the chips are down, without nec­
essarily knowing why, they hesitate to risk their own reproductive potential
on behalf of someone else's young.
    "Child labor, what a joke," groans a mother of my acquaintance, worn
down by her daughter's obstinance about household chores. The behaviors
parents so deplore turn out to be adaptive when "the young and the nestless"
light upon a niche of their own. If our language to describe such "fledglings"
has a birdy, aviocentric ring to it, that is because, as ornithologist Steve Emlen
delights in pointing out, cooperatively breeding birds and humans conform
to similar "decision rules" in respect to "helping at the nest."
    Extracting labor from adolescents and young adults is not an isolated
problem. In many foraging societies, women do not hit their stride as effi­
cient, diligent workers until well into adulthood. Often, the heaviest burdens
fall on the backs of older women. Older Pume women, for example, already
depleted by a lifetime of childbearing, end up carrying the heaviest loads­
                                                                      10
weighing anywhere from 7 to roo percent of their body weight.

    Across diverse taxa, cooperatively breeding animals rely on"helpers at the
nest," drawn primarily from the ranks of the prereproductive. Taken to the
extreme, among honeybees and other eusocial insects, heirs to the most dab­
orate and efficient "daycare" system ever evolved, prereproductive recruits
join the class of"sterile workers" never to become reproductives. However,
in most cooperative breeders, once a female starts to breed, she becomes less
available to rear the young of other mothers, and goes on producing babies
until she dies.
    There are some species (not necessarily cooperative breeders) in which
females cease cycling and then live on for a few years after menopause (lions
and baboons are examples), but these former mothers care mostly for their
own last offspring. In only three species are females known to quit reproduc­
ing and then go on living for a long time: humans, elephants, and pilot whales.
All happen to be particularly large as well as long-lived mammals.
    Women reach menopause by fifty but then live on another two to three
decades or more. Elephants and pilot whales breed until forty or so, then live
on among their daughters and granddaughters: until sixty in the case of
the whales, even longer for elephants. 11 For females this old, the costs-to­
benefits ratio of helping kin is completely altered. As compared to young

females, whose reproductive careers stretch out before them, older females
have a low threshold for responding to signals of need from immature rela­
tives. Much like a worker bee in a honey bee colony, who opts to become a
sterile helper rather than reproduce and almost certainly fail, these postre­
productives forage on behalf of needy kin. When available, this rarest of all
commodities, the postreproductive female, makes an ideal alloparcnt, assist­
ing other mothers to protect or provide for their weaned offspring.
    Why Postmenopausal Females Exist
If an egg is just a hen's way of making sure she is represented in the next gen­
eration's gene pool, what better route to success than for a hen to live on and
on, punctuating eternity with more eggs? A surprising number of creatures
enjoy such "indeterminate" lifespans. Among sturgeon and other teleost
(bony ) fishes, the longer a mother lives, the bigger she grows. The bigger she
grows, the more fecund she becomes. Her long lifespan translates into repro­
ductive success measurable in the gold standard of abundant caviar. But not
among mammals.
    One by one, some of the twentieth century 's greatest evolutionary theo­
rists (J.B.S. Haldane, Sir Peter Medawar, George Williams, William Hamil­
ton) have been drawn to the puzzle of senescence: Why do animals grow old
and die instead of breeding on and on? Each emerged with some variant of
the same solution: mammals have been selected for traits that help them sur­
vive in the short term even if the same traits prove detrimental in the long
term. Or, as Hamilton put it: they opt to "live now, pay later."
    Life is risky. Sooner or later, every organism succumbs to something­
lightning, floods, enemies. Evolutionists reckon that genetic traits that
benefit an organism early in life and help it reproduce before that fatal
encounter will be selected for, even if they carry with them associated (or
"pleiotrophic") effects detrimental later in life. Decay, then, must be viewed
as a by-product of early success. Probably to avoid the risk of mutations
which might otherwise arise in the dividing cells of the gcrmline, women arc
born with a fixed number of ovarian follicles, all they will ever have. After
fifty y ears of slow attrition, all the viable ones have been used up.
    Inevitable aging provides a plausible explanation for why the remaining
follicles decay, with a resulting decline in levels of circulating estrogen,
around age fifty in healthy women and chimpanzees; the same happens at
around thirty-plus years in captive macaques, and closer to twenty-four in

wild baboons.12 An extremely lucky wild baboon may manage to live as long
as twenty-se,·en years, hut she will start to experience irregular cycles by age
twenty-three, about a yeat· before she stops menstruating altogether. Simi­
larly, wild lions stop menstruating about two years before they die. This ces­
sation of cycling prior to death, or menopause, has led some evolutionists to
wonder if perhaps there was selection on females to "stop early," for ovaries
to wind down before kidneys, heart, and other organs do. According to this
hypothesis, menopause is an adaptive way to cope with the inevitability of
senescence: mothers quit producing new babies an<llive on just long enough
to ensure suniYal of that last offspring. 13
    Jane Goodall's "old Flo" is often cited to illustrate why "stopping early"
might be useful. This chimpanzee mother was already noticeably feeble when
she gaYe birth to her last baby, which died in infancy. At that point, her next­
to-last offspring, Flint, reattached himself. But when Flo lay down one day,
neYer to rise again, Flint-who, Goodall argued, had never become properly
independent-became despondent, grew ill, dying within a month of his
aged mother. How much better it would have been, if Flo had never given
birth to that last baby and instead devoted her remaining energy to making
sure Flint was strong enough to survive on his own. One healthy offspring ,
this argument r uns, is better than two dead ones. 14
    A series of distinguished theorists, most notably George Williams,
Richard Alexander, and Paul Sherman, have argued that menopause is an
adaptation to prevent aging females from making Flo's mistake. Stopping
early guarantees that old mothers who give birth to one last baby will care for
it long enough to see this reproductive enterprise through to a successful
conclusion. If menopause also means that old females are available to help
grandchildren and other kin as well, so much the better. This was the first of
three quite distinct hypotheses to become known under the rubric of "the
grandmother hypothesis"-although stopping early might more accurately
be termed "the prudent mother hypothesis," since she who stops reproducing
shortly before she dies is as likely to help her own offspring as those of her
daughter. 15
As with all long-lh·ed primates, a woman's fertility gradually increases after
menarche, when she first begins to cycle, peaks in early middle age, then
                  MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
slowly brakes to a full stop. In women who lead arduous lives, reproduction
may cease closer to for ty than fifty. But only a fraction of women anywhere
go on reproducing beyond fifty, and none past sixty. Fifty is a venerable upper
limit to the warranty on primate ovaries. It has remained constant for as long
as can be known, a milestone as inevitable among women in classical Greece
                                                                             6
and Rome as among women in contemporary Greece, Italy, or California.1
    From a comparative perspective, this scheduling is consistent with in­
formation about ovarian lifespans in other apes. "Live now, pay later," the
accepted explanation for senescence, provides a perfectly good explanation
for the reduction with age of a woman's reproductive potential. (The techni­
cal term is reproductive value, defined as the average genetic contribution to
subsequent generations that an organism of a particular age is expected to
contribute.)
    In humans, declining fertility with age is accompanied by a greater likeli­
hood of birth defects, as well as a higher likelihood of miscarriage. Even if
the DNA remains intact, cell structures in the supporting cytoplasm may
become defective over time. Resulting reproductive failures contribute to
even longer intervals between births as mothers approach the end of their
reproductive careers. Birth intervals may also be stretched out due to the
greater indulgence accorded late babies when they do arrive.
    Provided that mothers are not already overwhelmed by childcare, older
women are notorious for showering extra-tender loving care on last-horns.
From traditional sub-Saharan Africa to village India, to suburbs in postindus­
trial America, we find mothers "spoiling" the last-born child. Often, he or she
is identified with a special term of endearment. Where I grew up in Texas, a
last child was lovingly referred to as "the caboose." The rough equivalent
among the Gusii people of Kenya is omokooooti, the nickname for an older
woman's last-born, who will be breast-fed longer, weaned gently, and disci­
plined less.17 According to Hamilton's rule, such increasing maternal altru­
ism with age (and decreased reproductive value) is only to be expected.
    Why Old Females Are So Self-Sacrificing
Decline in reproductive potential with age means that mothers ncar the end
of their reproductive careers have less to lose by giving of themselves to their
own offspring-or hy assisting kin with theirs. In many species (recall the
self-sacrificing mothers who allow spidcrlings to cat them) females hecome
increasingly altruistic as they decline in reproductive value.
                               WHO      CARED?                              277
    Langur monkeys provide a particularly vivid primate example of old
females who become simultaneously more self-sacrificing and more heroic as
they age. Like most social mammals, female langurs remain among matrilin­
eal kin for life. Instead of the rigid hierarchies formed by macaque and
baboon females, a langur female's rank rises and falls over her life. Females
scramble up the social ladder in their youth, occupy top ranks of the hierar­
chy during their prime breeding years, then gradually opt out of competition
as they age, sinking back to the bottom. As a mother langur ages, intervals
between her births grow longer and longer. Finally she ceases to reproduce
altogether. Increasingly peripheralized, the aged langur becomes socially
invisible-like some aging starlet on the fringes ofHollywood.18
    Yet when neighboring groups trespass into her troop's territor y to exploit
a fruiting tree or some other finite resource to be found there, or when unre­
lated males invade and threaten infants belonging to her relatives, this same
old langur will discard her mantle of debility and rise up to heroically defend
her descendants' interests against great odds. Forget the image of an aging
starlet then, and think total warrior.
    Such a hero was old Sol, a langur I estimated to he at least twenty-five
years old . She had ceased to menstruate, and never reproduced in the half­
decade before she died . Hers was a solitary life spent on the fringes of the
group. Yet when the male shown in figure I I ·4 invaded her troop, it was Sol
who repeatedly charged this sharp-toothed male nearly twice her weight to
place herself between him and the threatened baby. When the infanticidal
male seized the infant in his jaws and ran off with him, Sol pursued the
attacker and wrested the wounded baby back. With danger momentarily
past, and the wounded infant once again in his mother's arms, old Sol
resumed her diffident attitude.
    That an arthritic old female would become marginalized with age is
scarcely surprising. More curious was Sol's transformation from decrepit
outcast to intrepid defender. Never before or since have I seen any animal so
unabashedly throw caution to the winds and take on an obviously stronger
animal with such fierce and selfless determination.
    Natural Selection and Postmenopausal Females
Increasing altruism with age (what fund-raisers call "donative intent") may be
critically important to explain why females in some species have evolved to
live on past the point where reproduction is still possible. By itself, though,
2]8                           MOTHERS      AND      ALLOMOTHERS
Fig. 1 1 ·4 Aged and decrepit, "Sol" avoided conflict with younger female rclath·es. Yet here, along
with another older but still reproductive female, she charges an adult male langur to retrieve an
infant that he has seized from its mother. The infant's body can be seen flying out like a rag from
the male's jaws. What's oddest of all about this picture is that neither defender is the mother. That
vigorous young female remained on the sidelines, out of harm's way. This was one of seven occa­
sions when I witnessed old Sol intervene to thwart this male's attacks on infants in her troop.
(S,rah Blaffir 1/rJy /Anrhro-Phoro)
greater altruism may not be enough. Three conditions have to be met before
there will be selection for females to live on not only past the time when their
ovaries wear out , but past the time when their last child becomes indepen­
dent. First, there must be donative intent toward kin. Next, there must be
something beneficial an old female can do for kin, like protecting or provi­
sioning them. Finally, the cost of having an old female around must be offset.
That is, like an old langur, she may opt out of competition with kin, or else
remain alive only so long as she increases the total amount of food available.
The more nearly these conditions arc met, the more likely selection will
favor long postmenopausal lifcspans.
     So far, efforts to measure how much well-intentioned older kin enhance
the reproductive success of offspring and grand-offspring yield mixed
results. Data from wild baboons show that the presence in the group of a
grandmother- whether she was menopausal or still fe•·tilc-was generally
beneficial; but the fact that a grandmother was postmenopausal did not trans­
late into statistically significant increases in the reproductive success of
her kin.19
     Data for captive vervet monkeys�an infant-sharing species in which
females directly care for other females' young hy carrying them--showed
                                  \VIIO    CARED?                            279
that infant survivorship was significantly higher if the infant's g•·andmothe•·
was present in the group; hut again it did not matter whcthc•· or not she
was postreproducth·e hc•·sclf. When the maternal grandmother was experi­
mentally remm·ed , her daughter's reproductive success declined: intervals
between her births grew Ionge•·, and when she did produce infants, they were
less likely to survive than if hcr (still reproductive) mother was around. These
ill dl'ects were most pronounced if the daughter herself was young and
                                 20
lacked maternal experience.
Fairly ol)\·iously , ha,·ing a mother or other well-disposed older kin around is
beneficial. But when is a female better off (in terms of genetic representation
in subsequent generations) devoting herself to the offspring of her relatives
rather than continuing to breed hersclf?There is little evidence that benefits
provided by an old female to her kin ever outweigh advantages from continu­
ing to reproduce as long as she can.21
    Postreproductive Longevity:
    Adaptation or Fringe Benefit?
The "live now, pay later" argument provides a perfectly good explanation for
whv J
       m·aries senesce. So far as I'm concerned, senescence combined with
stopping early explains menopause. After five decades or so, women cease
to ha,·e ,·iable eggs. But this does not explain why women and a few other
creatures go on living not just for a few years but for several decades after
menopause.
    Is their long postmenopausal lifespan adaptive, or just a by-product of the
fact that women today live in safer, healthier environments than ever before?
Once people managed to kill off their major predators, line up better and
more consistently available food supplies, and invent antibiotics , it seems
perfectly reasonable to suppose that like barnyard animals, people would go
on living longer simply as a fringe benefit of this new domesticity.
    This is a possibility. But the suggestion that living on after menopause is
just "a fringe benefit of domesticity" has its own problems. What about wild
elephants, another large-bodied, long-lived species living in tightly bonded
social groups in which alloparental care, including suckling other females'
babies, is ,·cry important? What about the \'arious octogenarian hunter-
 28o               MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
gatherers? No forager has ever made it to anything close to Frenchwoman
Jeanne Calment's record 1 2 2-and-a-half-years. But such foragers frequently
survive past middle age and remain active and vigorous for three to four
decades after their last child is bor n . Among the !Kung nomads most people
who reached age sixty could expect to live another ten years.
    Like elephants, humans are a species built to last. This is the conclusion of
the most extensive available study of primate body weights and brain sizes as
these relate to lifespan. Based on this study, human primates appear designed
to live to about seventy-two, far longer than any other ape, and considerably
longer than should be necessary for any mother who gives birth for the last
time at around age forty-five to pull her child through (the "stopping early"
hypothesis). 22 So far, the most reasonable conclusion is that postmenopausal
survival is more than a by-product of modern lifestyles.
    Emerging evidence for the importance of genes and underlying design
factors related to longevity is even more convincing. The genealogy of J�anne
Calment is a case in point. When researchers traced this Frenchwoman's
ancestors back to an eighteenth-century community of shopkeepers ncar
Aries, they found that all thirty-two of her great-great-great-grandparents
tended to be long-lived. Unless they died in accidents, her ancestors included
people who apparently just by chance lacked the genes that predispose peo­
ple to die of degenerative illnesses. Remarkable genetic luck converged in
this durable Frenchwoman, and passed to her brother as well; he lived to be
ninety-seven. Even more convincingly, in studies of twins, age of menopause
is closer among identical, or "monozygotic," twins than among "dizygotic"
ones. 23 Rather than a fringe benefit of domesticity, the most plausible expla­
nation for human lives lasting into the sixth and seventh decades and beyond
is that genes of people who lived longer were selected for. But why? And
especially, what advantage would there be for women to live on past the age
of reproduction?
All primates tend to he long-lived. They take about 2� percent more time to
breed and die than other mammals of comparable body size. But even by this
slow standard, the nineteen or so years that elapse before a hunter-gatherer
woman makes the switch from growth to reproduction seems long, given
                                      WHO        CARED?                                     281

 that all apes stop breeding by fifty. 25 Women actually reproduce during rela­
 tively few decades of their long lives. W hy?
     We already know that in species where females remain among their kin,
females become more altruistic with age. Based on data from peoples like the
 Hadza , older women also appear to work harder, and more effectively. They
 bring more gathered food back to camp than they consume. Incredibly fit and
282                MOTHERS       AND     ALLOMOTHERS
 wiry grandmothers, postreproductive women in their fifties and sixties, for­
age the longest hours, dig deeper for tubers, and spend more time gathering
berries and processing food than any other category of forager. In terms of
motivation and proficiency, women hit their stride sometime after thirty, by
which time they usually have weaned children. From then on, such women
keep on working, long after they quit bearing children. And if they don't have
                                                                   26
dependent children, they give the surplus away -usually to kin.
    For Hadza y oungsters in the vulnerable life phase just after weaning, hav­
ing postreproductive kinswomen on hand-aunts or grandmothers who,
quite literally, dig up something for them to eat-allows them to maintain
their weight better, grow faster, and are more likely to survive. Grand­
mothers are also repositories of important tribal knowledge. In societies like
the !Kung, the elderly are revered. As they put it, "the old people give y ou
life.'m
    Yet such reverence is a luxury not alway s forthcoming. Cultural attitudes
about old people vary, just as attitudes toward infants do. Attitudes toward
the infirm or the vulnerable are sensitive to local circumstances. For exam­
ple, old women have lower status in those societies where hunting is empha­
sized (the Eskimo, for example, or Chipewy an, or the Ache) than they do
among the !Kung or the Hadza, where gathered food is such a large part of
          28
the diet.
    An extra incentive beyond inherent altruism may help explain the dili­
gence of aging foragers. Some may fear being left behind-or worse. Because
meat is so important in the Ache diet, contributions by old women are less
important and Ache attitudes toward the old far less benevolent. In the Ache
culture, as among the Eskimos, euthanasia is practiced. Kim Hill and Mag·
dalena Hurtado recall a startling interview with an old hunter, then in his
mid-seventies, reminiscing hack to a time when just the sound of his foot­
steps on the leaves of the forest floor struck terror in the hearts of old
women. For he was a societally sanctioned specialist in eliminating old
women deemed no longer useful. He described his mode of operation: com­
ing behind an old woman unawares, he would strike her on the head with his
      29
axe.
    Today we take for granted that old people will he cared for long after they
cease to contribute to their families (and I am glad we do). But the capacity of
humans to evaluate contributions of family members, and to adjust their tol­
erance accordingly, has to he included in any attempt to model the evolution
                               WHO     CARED?
of postreproductive longevity through kin selection. W ithout such flexibility,
the burden imposed may often have been greater than a family could sustain.
The modern stereotype of grandmothers is more nearly a smiling white­
haired lady bearing Christmas presents than a wiry forager lugging large
tubers critical for warding off starvation among younger kin. For ours is an
androccntric culture in which women arc valued and judged according to
their rcproductiYe capacity (or sexual attractiveness) and few arc accustomed
to thinking of postmenopausal women as having a function. Yet in the United
States today, around four million children are currently being reared primar­
ily by a grandmother. A recent headline in the New York Times sums up the situ­
ation: "As welfare rolls shrink, load on relatives grows: Weary Milwaukee
grandmothers tell of strain."30
    Sociologist Arline Geronimus even suggests that having a healthy grand­
mother available to help may increase the odds that young women with poor
educational options (and worse marriage and job prospects) will neglect
birth control and become pregnant at an early age. According to this counter­
intuitive rationale , disadvantaged girls either consciously or unconsciously
sense the merits of reproducing young, while they are still healthy and free
of the worst consequences of sexually transmitted diseases , and especially
while mothers and grandmothers arc still around to help rear their baby.
Others emphasize psychological benefits to grandmothers. Given the stigma
attached to old age in women, helping to rear grandchildren may enhance an
aging woman's sense of worth and outweigh the substantial costs in time and
energy. Few Westerners give much thought to the antiquity of this pattern.
    Although not the case in the West today, in many parts of the world, and
throughout history, special roles for grandmothers were institutionalized.
Often grandmothers were expected to accord priority to the reproductive
interests of their progeny, as was the case in nineteenth-century Japan. For
Tokugawa era Japan, a woman's reproductive life ended when her eldest son
married-whether or not she had reached menopause. Even though she still
lived in the same house with her husband , it would have been scandalous for
her to give birth in the household now regarded as her son's. Her energy was
meant to be focused on helping her son to prosper, and to produce, in turn,
the finest heir that he could.

    Our Grandmothers' Clocks
All apes grow up slowly, but large-brained humans take the longest. In partic­
ular, young humans are nutritionally dependent for a far, far longer time.
Young chimps and gorillas who have just been weaned feed themselves. Just­
weaned children do so only partially, if at all. Since processed baby foods
enable women to wean offspring far sooner than other apes do, human babies
may be weaned earlier and spaced just a few years apart rather than separated
hy half a decade or more. This leaves human mothers with a load no other ape
mother undertakes: several simultaneously dependent youngsters. How
could a woman afford to put herself in this predicament? Why embark on a
costly enterprise with odds seemingly weighted against the likelihood that
she could rear such closely spaced dependent young to maturity?These ques­
tions lead back to the big difference between humans and other apes: our
much longer postmenopausal life.
    As behavioral ecologists began pondering differences between women
and other apes, it occurred to them that the postmenopausal life phase tacked
on at the end of a woman's reproductive career might be more than a recent
by-product, or fringe benefit, of domesticity. A group of them-including
Kristen Hawkes, James O'Connell, and Nick Blurton-Jones-turned to
Eric Charnov, a biologist who specializes in life-history theory. Using what
Charnov calls "invariant rules" for how mammalian life phases are pieced
together, they started to think of long lifespans as one integral component of
a package. If life is likely to last longer, it is worth taking the risk of growing
for a longer time before beginning to breed-like taking the trouble to care­
fully construct a piece of machinery that will be in use for a long time. The
bigger a mammal and the longer she lives, the longer it takes her to mature.
(By established convention, all life-history models are calibrated using a
breeding female.) The luxury of very slow maturation is primarily available to
those, like elephants, who can count on staying alive for a long time. This is
why slow development is not an option for a vulnerable little creature, like a
vole, who could be eaten at any moment. By this same logic, other slow­
growing apes mature faster than humans because they will also die sooner. 31
    Viewing extra-long human childhoods as an integral part of a long life that
includes a stint as postmenopausal grandmother helped explain the life­
historical differences between humans and other apes. 32 To distinguish this
model from other versions of "the grandmother hypothesis," which are aimed
                                \\' H 0  C A R E I> ?
at explaining menopause itself, rather than the extra-long life after meno­
pause, I call it "the grandmother's clock hypothesis."This hypothesis presup­
poses that there has been selection for genes that permit humans to live on
past the point where reproduction is no longer possible, as well as selection
for intemal metabolic adjustments that delay maturation. According to this
hypothesis, long childhoods came not as a gift from man-the-huntcr, hut as a
life-historical pt·clude to a long life in which all phases of growth, maturity,
senescence, and death arc interrelated. Broadly defined this way, the long
postmenopausal stint is, in fact, an integral pat·t of the human organism's
reproductirc plan.
    Accordingly, the metabolic clock that programs humans to mature slowly
could haYe emlved only in a primate-like species in which mothers were
already under selection pressure to live longer. This would occur if mothers
were selected first to live long enough to get their last offspring to indepen­
dence and thereafter selected because their altruism produced increased sur­
YiYal of close kin.
    Suppose, then, that once upon a time there was a dedicated forager with a
fortuitous complement of genes. She happened to live on past the point when
standard-issue ape ovaries normally wear out. Because she was a proficient
forager and already predisposed to help kin, she channeled surplus food to
recently weaned grandchildren because her own daughter (or perhaps her
son or brother's mate) had a new baby. Thus genes contributing to longevity,
shared in common among these kin, came to be disproportionately repre­
sented in succeeding generations, leading to a line of women who lived to
sixtv
    -'
       or seYenty Jvears.
    For those willing to entertain such a scenario, it is tantalizing to note that
long childhoods first appear in the fossil record about the time that Homo erec­
tus females grow larger. For many reasons, "big mothers" often make better
mothers. They are able to more safely bear large babies, protect them, and
efficiently carry them long distances; and with their greater strength they can
more easily dig up and carry gathered provender. Thus, hominid females
could afford the luxury of growing for a longer period of time and getting
bigger if they were also leading "reproductively productive" lives by provi­
sioning kin for longer.
    Paleontologists have long had reason to suspect some change in hominid
economies about soo,ooo to        1 .J million years ago that either made more

food available or somehow lessened the risk of starvation during recurring
famines. W ithout such an improvement, it becomes difficult to explain the
evolution of larger body size among Homo erectus females. There may have
been technological innovations that made food more available-superior
gathering and hunting techniques as ''vel) as fire for cooking have all been sug­
gested. The possibility I prefer, however, is that the change derived from the
kind of"fitness bonanza" (Hawkes's phrase) postreproductive gatherers pro­
                  ll
vided to kin.
    Hypotheses about origins arc notoriously difficult to test , and this one is
still so new that few archaeologists or ethnographers have tried. However, if
this life-historical version of the grandmother hypothesis holds up, it will
offer a very different slant on the evolution of wise Homo. Much depends on
just how typical patterns of grandmaternal provisioning documented for the
Hadza turn out to be among African foragers generally. Were older female
relatives likely to keep young relatives from starving during the relevant
phase when longer human lifcspans were cmlving?
    According to previous models, a man's success as a hunter permitted him
to obtain mates and do a better job of provisioning his ofl'spring. Since moth­
ers could count on food from the father, they could aflord to bear slow­
maturing babies, whose brains would have a chance to grow and develop
                                 WHO     CARED?
during a long, costly period of dependency. But think about it. The reproduc­
ti\"e benefits of being a little hit smarter would have had to he tremendous
in order to offset the obvious costs of taking a long time to mature. What if
a girl or hoy died before puberty, as most probably did? What if some fast­
maturing slouch out-competes a slower-developing contemporary? A long,
slow period of brain growth, development, and learning becomes more feasi­
ble, however, if early members of the genus Homo were already committed to
maturing slowly.
     It is hard to imagine how being a hominid just a little smarter than others
in the population could by itself offset the risks of delaying reproduction as
long as two decades. By contrast, benefits to be had from surviving past
reproductive age were clear and immediate-especially for females who
were already dedicated to helping kin, and in a position to do something
survival-enhancing for them. Being a little smarter did not have to offer big
payoffs right away to compensate slow maturers for delaying reproduction:
modest initial benefits would suffice if childhoods were long anyway.
     Long lives, and with them long childhoods , would have altered the
hominid equation. Small reproductive payoffs from being smarter would be
sufficient to select for sapient brains in worlds where greater intelligence did
not have to compensate completely for the enormous costs of delayed matu­
ration. Of such lives one could confidently say, I grow slowly, therefore I
think. I develop slowly, erao coaito.

N
            o girl in the Pleistocene could have reached menarche as early
            as many twelve-year-olds do today, nor become pregnant in her
            early teens. Even those who conceived in their mid-teens did so
under unusual-spectacularly good-conditions. Such a forager would have
required nutritional subsidies from others to permit her to mature so early.
In the modern world, however, being fat enough to ovulate is no longer tied
to having a supportive social network who will help rear her child.
    What happens, then, when an unwed teenager, sufficiently well fed to
ovulate but lacking social support, finds herself pregnant? The novelist
George Eliot was one of the first writers to explore this topic. Her fictional
case study accords with what psychiatrists and epidemiologists have learned
since.
    Case Study in Neonaticide
Eliot's 1 859 novel Adam Bede traces the coming of age of a plump, pretty, and
self-absorbed dairymaid, Hetty Sorrel, an orphan living with a respectable
and prosperous aunt. Seduced by a local squire, Hetty becomes pregnant.
Lacking kin support, she denies the pregnancy to herself, conceals it from
others, and makes no preparation for the impending birth. In short, Hetty
exhibits what psychiatrists today recognize as the main risk factors for
neonaticidc. 1
    Like the notorious New Jersey teenager who gave birth in a bathroom
stall during a school dance and left her baby in the trash, Hetty gives birth,
in secret and alone. She is numb, confused, and unable to feel anything about
the baby except her fear that if the birth is discovered, the consequences will
be bad, her       future ruined. "I         buried it in the wood ... the little
baby . . . and it cried . . . I heard it cry. . . . But I thought perhaps it
                                             288
                         UNNATURAL           MOTHERS
wouldn't die-there might somebody find it. I didn't kill it-1 didn't kill it
mysclf."2
    T he baby's cries just postpartum would have been an unusually powerful
auditory stimulus; they would indeed have pierced right "through" the
mother. Comparisons of women in different reproductive phases reveal that
even prior to stimulation of the nipples by the baby, the abandoning mother's
hormone leYcls would be altered. Following studies of new mothers today,
we can expect that Hetty's heart rate would have accelerated at the first
utterance, decelerated as the cry intensified, and then risen again, with con­
comitant changes in pulse and perspiration-measurable through conductiv­
ity of her skin to an electric current, the same response polygraphs pick up
when an anxious person tells a lie. 3
    Eliot depicts Hetty as amoral and emotionally shallow, but otherwise
healthy. She is a physically lovely young human animal, not so much deranged
as emotionally detached, especially from a baby she docs not want to take
responsibility for.

George Eliot's portrayal of a pregnant teenager's plight was as realistic as it
was unusual. It remains true that infants born to teenage mothers , especially
those lacking social support, are most at risk.4 Yet then as now, it was still
assumed that mothers arc naturally nurturing. Any woman who kills her own
infant must be deranged.
    Consider early-twentieth-century admissions records for Broadmoor,
Britain's state asylum for the criminally insane. Forty-eight percent of the
women hospitalized between I 902 and I 9 2 7 were women who had commit­
ted infanticide. 5 Today, being a devoted mother is still equated with mental
health .6 But Hetty is not crazy; she merely falls at the noninvesting end of the
continuum of maternal responsiveness found among mothers who give birth
at a young age, under poor circumstances, or with insufficient allomaternal
support.
    Because killing one's own infant is so abhorrent to us, even less compre­
hensible to many people than is male brutality toward an unrelated infant,
there is a tendency to compartmentalize the mother's actions as the inten­
tional killing of her infant, and to consi<ler her behavior in isolation from her
circumstances, even though they are functionally related. When we treat
infanticide as an aberration, and as a crime (which, of course, in all modern

Fig. 1 2. 1 Unlike mothers who kill neonates right after birth, mothers who kill older children are
likely to be mentally ill, often suicidal, or desperate beyond reason . Such was the case with Mar­
garet Garner, "the modern Medea," who killed her infant daughter and two older sons. She was
captured as she and other slaves attempted to escape. Margaret Garner's terrible choice,
between killing her children and having them reenslaved, was the subject ofToni Morrison's
novel Beloved. (From a wood engra•·ing rhar appeared m Harp<"r's Wc.-kly, based on a phor"Braph by rhe Brad)" studio tfa paint­

societies, it is), we arc likely to obscure underlying motivations.7 Many peo­
ple snatch at implausible straws so as to cling to the conviction that the
emotional ambivalence many mothers feel about investing in infants is
"unnatural," and hence very rare, and completely separate from more com­
mon, or "normal," maternal emotions. No connections are drawn between
the ordinary distancing of a new mother from her infant, on the one hand,
and these very extreme failures of maternal bonding that end in tragedy, on
the other. Even those who accept that infanticide takes place-among hea­
thens, somewhere else --arc often reluctant to accept its natural occurrence
among civilized or Christian people.
     The unwillingness to acknowledge infanticide among creatures like our­
selves, except as mot-ally compromised, subhuman behavior, has a sporadic
history in the West. The euphemistic catchall term overlayiny used to be

invoked when infants were "accidentally" smothered by their caretakers. In
fifteenth-century Florence, for example, Is percent of deaths among infants
sent to wet nurses were attributed to this type of mishap. Taking "overlaying"
at face ,·alue, an eighteenth-century physician advised Britons to adopt a new
im·cntion, the Florentine arcutio, a three-foot-long wooden cage designed to
prevent a woman from accidentally suffocating a baby in her bed. Italian
nurses were obliged to usc them under pain of excommunication.8
    T here is no evidence, however, that arcutios made any difference. Coro­
ners' reports for London in the period between I 8s s and 1 8 6o (about the
time George Eliot was describing Hetty Sorrel) list 3,900 deaths, mostly of
newborns, from "overlaying." In subsequent inquests,                        I, 1 20 of these cases
were deemed murder. 9 T hen as now, one suspects, it was rare for co-sleeping
to result in smothered babies. (Harder mattresses, or forbidding caretakers
to drink or take opium, would have been more effective at preventing true
accidents than prescribing this cumbersome contraption.)
    Long after the arcutio was first invented, thousands of infant deaths in
eighteenth-century England were still being attributed to overlaying. Today,
doctors and coroners sweep fairly obvious cases of infanticide under a new
euphemistic rug: unexplained sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Un­
questionably, some babies (about                     I   in 1 ,ooo) spontaneously stop breathing
for unexplained reasons; many of these SIDS cases may involve heart-rhythm
defects. 10 But not so many as otherwise cynical detectives, coroners, and
pediatricians readily accept.
    In England, it took a justifiable invasion of patients' privacy by a suspicious
British pediatrician to end a massive and futile quest for a will-o' -the-wisp­
a supposed genetic trait running in families that causes successive infants to
suddenly stop breathing. Over a period of years in a London hospital, medical
personnel working in conjunction with police secretly videotaped mothers
attempting to smother their infants who had been hospitalized for recurrent
sleep apnea. In the United States, the highly publicized 1995 murder trial of
Waneta Hovt     I
                    had the same cffcct.11
                   MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    Mrs.Hoyt was a New York State housewife with serious emotional and
financial problems whose four newborns and one older infant successively
died,their deaths attributed to SIDS.  An amazing feature of the Hoyt case is
how many people expressed doubts,only to have them overridden.People
around Waneta Hoyt were reluctant to hurt her feelings by expressing suspi­
cions.
    The case would never have come to trial had not one unusually blunt
woman medical examiner from Dallas mentioned to a Syracuse detective
how statistically preposterous the familial SIDS diagnosis was. People believe
what they want, she told him,and "they don't want to believe that a mother
could possibly do something like this to her own child."12
    The next-to-last of five Hoyt babies to die of sudden infant death syn­
drome (in 1970) was in the hospital being monitored for her "sleep apnea
condition " just days before she died.By then a handful of psychiatrists were
cautioning medical personnel that some undeterminable portion of SIDS cases
might be infanticides. 13 Several nurses at the hospital became concerned by
the mother's indifference to her infant, along with the fact that when alone
with "Molly," Mrs. Hoyt rarely touched her,and never held the baby close
even during bottle-feeding. One nurse noted in Molly Hoyt's charts that
"I discussed my concern for the baby with [the doctor in charge] this
a.m....The interaction between mother and baby is almost nil in my opin-
ion ...."Another told the director of the SIDS research project that "I don't
like the way the mother is acting....There's no maternal instinct there. She
pulls away from the baby like she really doesn't want to be bothered."14 To no
avail.
    The Hoyt case cannot be dismissed as tunnel vision by medical researchers
intent on proving at any cost a pet theory about SIDS.Too many people had to
ignore too much.They simply took for granted how a mother must feel about
her infants.After the fifth death, Waneta Hoyt went on to apply for and adopt
a two-and-a-half-year-old baby, a child she and her husband successfully
reared.
    The "suggestion that a proportion of children with recurrent apnea ...
have been suffocated [still] tends to produce either outrage or skepticism,"
Roy Mcadow ruefully noted.Meadow was in a position to know. He was the
pediatrician whose hidden videos documented twenty-seven different moth­
ers "creating" infant breathing disorder.
                                        An unfortunate legacy of the misdiag­
nosed SIDS cases is that now parents whose infants do suddenly die of natural,

hard-to-diagnose causes will have to cope with both that tragedy and the
unjustified suspicion of medical personnel newly converted to a previously
undreamed-of possibility.
While studying infanticide among nonhuman primates, I would learn in the
most up-dose-and-personal way how emotionally charged this topic can be.
A year after completing my Ph. D., in 1976 I was in Washington, D.C. for the
annual meeting of the American Anthropological Society. One of the grand
old men of physical anthropology was sitting in the front row as I laid out the
lines of evidence that led me to conclude that infanticide had been going on
among primates for a long time, and that under certain conditions it was an
adapth·e rather than a pathological behavior. I was not even talking about
mothers, but about the phenomenon of unrelated males from outside the
breeding system who kill infants sired by competing males. "Offspring arc
vital to the continued survival of any species," I began. "At first glance, it
seems surprising to find selection for behavior that docs not contribute to the
survival of infants, odder still to find selection for behaviors that actually
decrease infant survivorship."
    As I spoke, I noticed the muscles on the great man's face tighten, and his
jaw set. At the end of my talk he rose abruptly and turned to face the audi­
ence. Langur monkeys elsewhere did not behave the way I had described, he
announced. These monkeys were "not normaL" Later he was to tell a public
audience at the American Psychological Association meetings that the mon­
keys I studied were deranged. On that day, he walked down the main aisle and
out of the room while I was completing my reply. In the pages of The American
Scientist another anthropologist questioned whether these could possibly be
"Normal monkeys?" (the heading under which the letter ran). Since everyone
knows that animals reproduce in order to perpetuate their species (group
selection still reigned supreme in those days), she argued, no normal animal
would deliberately kill an infant . Such death rates as I was reporting from
infanticide could only represent "destruction, not adaptation."15 Because they
did not benefit the species, they must be pathologicaL
                                                     16
    Within anthropology this debate still persists,     long after accumulating
evidence for beetles, spiders, fish, birds, mice, ground squirrels, prairie dogs,
wolves, bears, lions, tigers, hippopotami, and wild dogs led biologists to take
294                MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
for granted that there are a range of conditions under which mothers cull
their litters and abandon or cannibalize young, and an even wider range of
circumstances in which unrelated males or rival mothers take advantage of
the vulnerability of infants. None of these cases, even when far less well doc­
umented, met the same kind of resistance as did the initial suggestion that
infanticide among primates like ourselves was an evolved behavior, an adap­
tive way for individuals to resolve dilemmas confronting them in the course
of reproduction, and not out of the range of"normal" behavior.
Unwillingness among social scientists to believe that primates evolved to
behave in such a repugnant way is one reason why many anthropologists are
still reluctant to accept that infanticide might be adaptive under some cir­
cumstances. But there is also a more complicated reason why anthropologists
hesitate to attribute infanticide to the people they study. They worry about
the eagerness with which humans ascribe atrocities to other peoples, and the
various ways we use labels like "inhuman actions" to dehumanize those
accused of committing them.
    Accusing people of depraved behavior can be the first step to viewing
them as "moral inferiors" and denying them basic human rights. Sensitive to
such concerns , some anthropologists are reluctant to publish data on behav­
ior that might be used to justify social or political intervention.
    Extracting sound data from propaganda and confidential sources is prob­
lematic. Even in societies where infanticide is sanctioned, it remains a painful
subject . Almost all mothers are reluctant to talk about it. 17 Gathering reliable
information on live births that terminate in infanticide usually requires field­
workers to augment detailed censusing with in-depth interviews with both
mothers and their associates .
    In 1990, a conference o n infanticide sponsored b y the National Science
Foundation and the Italian government18 was convened in what seemed an
appropriate venue: a mist-shrouded medieval village named Erice on a moun­
taintop in Sicily, well out of public view. I was preparing a technical report for
the conference on ecological and cultural factors contributing to high versus
low rates of infanticide in tribal societies. Why is infanticide common in some
groups, virtually nonexistent in others?

    Unusually detailed information was available for some dozen societies. At
a gross level, the answer was obvious. Mothers kill their own infants where
other forms of birth control arc unavailable. Mothers were unwilling to com­
mit themselves and had no way to delegate care of the unwanted infant to
others-kin, strangers, or institutions. History and ecological constraints
interact in complex ways to produce different solutions to unwanted births.
The task of evaluating the evidence became unexpectedly comp1icated, how­
ever, when several of the fieldworkers responsible for collecting the most
detailed case studies expressed concern that even the use of code names for
particular individuals, and even for tribal affiliation (routine practice), might
not he enough to disguise identities. They requested that all reference to their
data he deleted. Another anthropologist who was at the conference to des­
cribe discriminatory treatment of orphans among the South American tribe
he studied withdrew his paper from the published proceedings of the confer­
ence, fearing condemnation from colleagues.
    From a scientific point of view, the problem was so stark that all thirty sci­
entists from around the world who had gathered at Erice signed a statement
(prepared by biologists Fred vom Saal and Stefano Parmigiani) calling for a
"spirit of free inquiry and reporting of politically sensitive findings."
    Of course scientific information can be misused by others for political
ends. But those intent on doing so will do so whether or not their informa­
tion is accurate. The !Kung, for example, have become widely known as The
Harmless People  - the title of an early ethnography about them-while the
Yanamamo are best known by Napoleon Chagnon's epithet The Fierce People.
Both stereotypes (as the authors of these works arc the first to point out) are
narrow characterizations of multifaceted people-oversimplifications not
meant to be taken at face value. Yet ultimately such scholarly caveats are
thrown to the wind when politicians turn to these publications to justify their
actions. The homelands of both groups arc currently being appropriated
by technologically superior neighbors: the lands of the "harmless" people
because they arc deemed too childlike to have property rights, those of the
"fierce" ones because they arc viewed as too nasty, too savage, to deserve
them.20
    In the end, signers of the "Erice Statement" concluded that more harm
than good is done "by attempting to suppress the truth." By 1998, medical
doctors as well were calling for more open discussion of maternal ambiva­
lence and infanticide. 21 One of the ironies of the attempt to suppress report-
                           UNNATURAL           MOTHERS
 ing on infanticide is that the more we learn about the full range of maternal
 beha\'iors, the weaker become the grounds for ethnocentric moralizing, for
making distinctions between "civilized" and "savage" people, between Chris­
 tians and non-Christians, and so on.
     Many millions of infant deaths can be attributed directly or indirectly to
 maternal tactics to rnitigate the high cost of rearing them. These tactics
 include leaving infants at foundling homes with terrible survival statistics, in
 addition to the everyday decisions by women in many parts of the world who
 decide for various reasons not to breast-feed and hence rely on powdered
 formulas , of necessity mixed with local water so polluted as to make baby
 food a prescription for dysentery. When mothers distance themselves psy­
 chologically from excess or inopportunely born infants, such decisions
 become easier. But it is important to be clear: odd cases aside (and the Hoyt
 case may or may not be one),22 mothers don't set out to commit infanticide.
 Rather, abandonment is at one extreme of a continuum that ranges between
 termination of investment and the total commitment of a mother carrying
 her baby everywhere and nursing it on demand. Abandonment is, you might
 say, the default mode for a mother terminating investment . Infanticide occurs
 when circumstances (including fear of discovery) prevent a mother from
 abandoning it. Although legally and morally there is a difference, biologically
 the two phenomena are inseparable.
     Unkindness ofKin and Reliance on Strangers
 The late historian John Boswell is best known for his writings on same-sex
 unions among early Christians. How this man with no special interest in par­
 enting came to produce a monumental study of child abandonment in the
 West (The Kindness if Stranoers: The Abandonment if Children in Western Europe
from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance) is a fascinating story in itself.
     While researching early Christian sexual mores, Boswell came across
 some odd advice given by prominent early theologians. Men should be care­
 ful never to visit brothels or have recourse to prostitutes because in doin9 so
 they mioht unwittinoly commit incest.
     What a peculiar and oblique appeal to virtue! Boswell's curiosity was
 piqued. "Although the 'exposure' of children was a part of the standard litany
 of Roman depravities," Boswell noted, "I had understood [the babies] were
 left to die on hillsides. I never imagined that it was a widespread or common
 practice, and certainly had not thought that Christians abandoned babies."
                    MOTHERS       AND    ALLOMOTHERS
Was the warning predicated on the remote possibility that someone's aban­
doned child could end up in a brothel "worth mentioning simply because it
would be so dreadful if it did happen?" In the end Boswell succumbed to
logic: "If Christian fathers did not abandon their children, they would hardly
be dissuaded from visiting brothels by the threat of incest.'123
    Boswell's book grew out of this chance encounter with an odd admonition
to virtue. From trial and church records, civil and canon law, Boswell deter­
mined that children were given away and abandoned in great numbers
throughout this period by parents belonging to every social class. Parents
had all sorts of reasons for not rearing a child. Perhaps they already had too
many children to feed, or daughters to provide dowries for when they grew
up. Perhaps the child's birth, if known, would bring shame upon the family,
or perhaps the infant was defective. These early Christian parents, much like
the "barbarians" Darwin and various anthropologists described, abandoned
rather than killed their unwanted infants. The deeper Boswell delved, the
clearer it became that very nearly the majority of women living in Rome dur­
ing the first three centuries of the Christian era who had reared more than
one child had also abandoned at least one. He found himself looking at rates
of abandonment of around 2o to 40 percent of children born. If Romans gave
to crippled beggars it was because "everyone is afraid he might say no to his
own child."
    Still, Boswell assured readers, most of those abandoned "were rescued and
brought up either as adopted members of another household or as laborers of
some sort." Abandonment, he assumed, functioned as a benign way of recy­
cling children, transferring them from those who had too many to those who
had too few. W hether they were exposed anonymously, sold, donated to
monasteries as "oblates," or substituted for someone else's deceased child,
Boswell remained convinced that abandoned infants died at a rate only
slightly higher than the normal; "the death of expositi !exposed infants] docs
not appear to have been common at any time under the [Roman] empire."
According to this very optimistic view, "the 'kindness of strangers' in every
age seems to have been sufficient to rescue most abandoned children."24
    Boswell emphasized the altruistic end of the wide range of motivations
people have when they stoop along a muddy road to pick up helpless, crying,
starving babies, and he seriously underestimated how difficult it would have
been to keep infants who were deprived of breast milk alive without baby
bottles, sterile water, or formula.
                          UNNATURAL              MOTHERS
    When mcdieYalist Mary Martin Mclaughlin reviewed The Kindness                      ?J
Stran gers for the New }ork Times Book Review she reminded readers that as soon
as better records become available (by the early fifteenth century) and we get
"substantial testimony to the fates of children, the picture is far from happy."
Abandoned children were sometimes substituted for people's own children,
or became ,·alued laborers as "other sources of slaves dried up." These chil­
dren fared the best. But by and large, the treatment of abandoned children
was not nearly so "gentle" as Boswell hoped . Some significant portion of those
who sun-h·ed were being sold as slaves and prostitutes-which is what they
were doing in brothels in the first place. 25
    The lasting importance of Boswell's scholarship docs not lie in his ideas
about the recycling of babies by strangers, but in his documentation of how
widespread maternal abandonment of infants was in antiquity. Some portion
of European foundlings surely survived. But that proportion varied with time
and location, depending primarily on whether or not abandoned babies
ended up in the arms of a suitable wet nurse. Even those who survived would
haYe confronted an uncertain future at best.
    "Unintended Consequences on a Massive Scale"
The explicit aim of foundling homes was to prevent abandoned infants from
dying. T he "Hospital of the Innocents," one of the earliest such institutions in
the world, still stands in Florence, a stately reminder of a catastrophic experi­
ment in social engineering. Founded in I 4 I 9, with assistance from the silk
guilds, the Ospedale degli Innocenti was completed in 1445". 26 Ninety found­
lings were left there the first year. By I 5" 39 (a famine year), 96 I babies wer e left.
EYentually five thousand infants a year poured in from all corners ofTuscany.
    Although the best known, the Innocenti was just one, the largest, of six­
teen such foundling homes in the Grand Duchy ofTuscany. Three centuries
after it opened, mortality rates were still appalling. Of I 5" ,ooo babies left at
the Innocenti between I7H and I 773, two-thirds died before reaching their
first birthday. 27
Elsewhere in Europe groups of citizens and governments were similarly dis­
turbed by the large numbers of unwanted infants left along roads and in gut­
ters. In city after city the same painful experiment was repeated. In England,

retired sea captain Thomas Coram got royal backing to build a home for
deserted children. W hen it opened in 1741, it became immediately apparent
that he had underestimated the magnitude of the problem. Mothers fought at
the gates for admission. By I n6 the British Parliament guaranteed funds to
ensure open admissions, with the result that within four years, 1 s ,ooo chil­
dren had been admitted. Mortality rates soared, as there were simply not
enough wet nurses to go around.
     To the cast, imperial foundling homes in Moscow and St. Petersburg were
formally opened by Catherine II of Russia. The bountiful empress had fallen
under the influence of an idealistic reformer named Ivan Bctskoi who drew
her attention to the children abandoned in the streets of Moscow and the
"incomparably greater number" who "having managed to draw their first
breath arc deprived of it secretly by merciless mothers and their inhuman
              •       nlM
accomp I1ccs.
     Having traveled thmugh Europe, Bctskoi was familiar with the writings of
reformers like Rousseau. He became convinced that with proper rearing,
almost anything was possible. Bctskoi persuaded Empress Catherine that
foundlings could he reared to provide the trained labor pool that would allow
Russia to develop along Western lines.

    The ,·cry tangible results were the imperial foundling homes in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, intended to qualify Russia as a player in the mid­
eighteenth-century European Enlightenment. The doors of these grand
repositories were formally opened in                   1 764. Both the St. Petersburg and
Moscow foundling homes were soon admitting a steady stream of ill-fated
applicants. Of the S2 3 children admitted during the first year, 81 percent
died. There followed two years of improved survival prospects, culminating
in the catastrophe of              1 767. Ninety-nine percent of 1 ,o89 infants admitted
that year failed to survive to the next. 29
    The foundling homes became focal points of contagion for smallpox,
syphilis, and dysentery. But the key problem was always how to feed infants
without introducing lethal diarrhea-causing pathogens . Without nutritionally
fortified baby formulas and sterile water to mix with them, the availability of
breast milk has always been, and in many parts of thc world continues to he,
the single most important predictor of infant sur vival. As this reality emerged
J02               MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
from a grim period of trial and error, administrators in Moscow and St.
Petersburg developed plans to contract with peasant women to breast-feed
babies from the foundling homes.
    A fine plan in principle, but the administrators failed to foresee the
number of parents who would seize the chance to delegate care of their chil­
dren to others. By providing payments to wet nurses, the state foundling
homes also created financial incentives for the torsovki, women peddlers who
scoured the countryside for abandoned babies to deposit at the foundling
homes. These babies were then transported from the foundling homes back to
the countryside, where they generated pitiful stipends for peasant women.
Many of these "wet nurses" kept the passbooks guaranteeing payment and
passed their charges on to even more poorly paid-and not necessarily lac­
tating-women . Even more desperate were the unmarried women who
managed to secure for themselves skimpy sinecures by getting pregnant,
depositing their own baby at a foundling home, and then qualifying to wet­
nurse a foundling for pay. A tiny, lucky percentage of the hired wet nurses (if
anyone in this tragic network can be called lucky) managed to bribe a
foundling-home employee to assign them their own infants. In the words of
historian David Ransel, the state's well-intentioned plan for caring for infants

    Foundling homes offered ambivalent parents an easy, blameless option for
delegating the costs of lactation and provisioning to someone else. Unfortu­
nately, unless they essentially adopt the baby, unrelated alloparents can rarely
be counted on for wholehearted commitment. And for mothers without
access to birth control, not suckling their newborns often meant that they
conceived again soon, sometimes within the year, only adding to the number
of unwanted babies.
    Epidemics of Foundlings
Because there were rarely enough lactating nurses to go around, foundling
homes did little more than forestall death from exposure-just long enough
to ensure that the baby was baptized. W ithout the nutritional and immuno­
logical benefits of mother's milk, most died in the first months, of infectious
diseases or starvation. We know this because of just how well the staff at the
foundling homes did at least part of their job. Keeping infants alive was often
beyond their capacity. But an extraordinary bureaucracy grew up to record,
                          UNNATURAL         MOTHERS
in neat columns, detailed information on each of their charges: the exact date
the infant was admitted; its sex, age, and whether or not the baby was bap­
tized; any identifying tokens, coins, or scraps of cloth or notes parents might
have left with the baby ; and date of death. As historical demographers began,
locality by locality, to transform neatly scripted columns of figures into rates
and totals, it became clear that foundling homes were magnets for a much
wider population than simply um..·ed mothers and poor domestics seduced
by employers. Parents-often married couples-from a broad catchment
area saw the orphanages as a way to delegate to others parental effort for off­
spring they could scarce afford to rear. Mothers poured in from the rural
areas to deposit babies in the cities . What has generally been studied as a
patchwork of various, discret e, local crises is really a wide-scale, demo­
graphic catastrophe of unprecedented dimensions.
    I still recall the crisp autumn day in the old cathedral city of Durham,
England, when at a conference on abandoned children, the full extent of a
phenomenon I had been aware of for y ears sank in.11 The talks were routine
scientific fare. Overhead projectors flashed graphs and charts onto a screen.
The black lines sprawling across the grid summarized data from European
foundling homes, tracking changes in infant mortality rates over time. ll As
the morning wore on, the phenomenon of child abandonment was described,
country by country, epoch by epoch, for England, Sweden, Italy, even Portu­
gal's colony in the Azores. Gradually it dawned on me that this phenomenon
affected not tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of infants, as I
had long assumed, hut millions of babies. I grew increasingly numb. I recall
that I had difficulty breathing. As I distanced my self emotionally from these
findings by seeking to analyze what they meant, I may have experienced (in a
very remote and quite insulated way) the sort of surreal distancing other
mothers long ago must have undergone as they adjusted so as not to see or
feel what was before them. My subconscious, no doubt dwelling on my own
children, dredged up, of all things, fantastical illustrations from Maurice
Sendak's ominous classic Outside Over There. It was a book I had read to each of
my own children. Sendak depicted columns of babies floating mysteriously
over bridges, and down paths and stream beds. At that moment they clearly
represented ghosts, streams of babies flowing from the city out to wet nurses
in the country in one direction, and from poor peasant households in the
countryside into urban foundling homes, flowing back the other way. There

was nothing exotic about this heritage. It was my own. In time, I became
desensitized to this information. In what follows, I treat it like any of the
other material that scientists call "data ."
    Italy provides some of the most complete records on infant abandonment,
and these data have been analyzed by a roster of distinguished historians
and demographers, among them the anthropological demographer David
Kertzer. By I64o, 2 2 percent of all children baptized in Florence were babies
that had been abandoned. Between I_s-oo and I]oo, this proportion never fell
below I 2 percent. In the worst years on record, during the 184os, 43 percent
of all infants baptized in Florence were abandoned. In the Grand Duchy of
Tuscany around the same time, s ,ooo were abandoned-practically Io per­
cent of all those born.
    As in much of Catholic Europe, a ruota, or rotating barrel, was installed in
I66o to replace the old marble basin at Florence's main foundling home, the
Innocenti. By I699, however, it was necessary to place a grill across the open­
ing to prevent parents from shoving in older children as well.
    To the north, at the foundling home in Milan, 343,406 children were left
between 16_s-9 and I9oo. For Milan in the year I87), 9I percent of illegiti­
mate children whose births managed to get recorded were abandoned.
But the Italian cities were not isolated cases. Comparative data compiled by
Kertzer for the period I88o-89 reveal an annual average of I _s-,475" infants
abandoned in Moscow; 9,4)8 in St. Petersburg, which is comparable to fig­
ures showing 9,IoI abandoned in Vienna during the I86os, and 2, 2oo in
Madrid between I8oo and I8o9. T he majority would not survive. In one of
the worst sets of statistics, of 7 2, ooo infants abandoned in Sicily between
I783 and I8o9, about 2o percent sur vived. The scale of mortality was so
appalling, and so openly acknowledged, that residents of Brescia proposed
that a motto be carved over the gate of the foundling home: "Here children
are killed at public expense."33
    Putting Espositos in Perspective
In the "civilized" world, a woman who suffocates her newborn has committed
a crime. She goes to jail. But a woman whose baby dies because she psycho­
logically distances herself from her newborn and opts not to breast-feed,
with the result that the baby succumbs to dy sentery, is viewed merely as igno­
rant. Similarly, a mother who abandons her infant to a foundling home­

Fig.   1 2.6    From medieval times onward, rotating bar rels were set up in the walls of foundling
homes so that parents could deposit an unwanted baby, ring a hell, and fade anonymously into
the night. It would have been unusual for the father to accompany the mother, as depicted in this

regarded as unfortunate, but legally and spiritually blameless. Technically, her
infant will die of malnutrition or dysentery, not neglect; she did not kill it. 34
      Even as cultural amnesia and other sleights of mind wipe clear the West­
ern slate concerning acts and omissions responsible for more infant deaths
than from several plagues combined, tangible reminders of the West's legacy
of "unnatural mothers" persist in marble statues, stately Renaissance build­
ings where unwanted infants were warehoused, in police reports, and in
crumbling ledgers from the foundling homes. Even phone books in most
large metropolitan cities still bear witness.
      Throughout Europe it was the practice for each foundling to be given a
name as he or she was logged in, a first name and then a generic last one,
names like Esposito (Italian for "exposed") or Trouve (French for "found"). In
 Milan, many were given the last name Colombo, for the pigeons that alighted
on the roof of the foundling home there and adorned its emblem. (This prac­
tice was abandoned in 1 8 2 s, as the Milanese authorities found it awkward to

device similar to the Italian ruota, the thing came to be known as the "Napoleonic whed."The

has hands to receive hut neither eyes to sec nor a mouth to tell." As late as the mid-nineteenth

ha,·e tens of thousands of people with the same last name, and they worried
about the stigma attached to being abandoned.) A durable fraction of these
foundlings were lucky, robust, or resourceful enough to survive. T hey grew
up and went on to have families of their own. During a recent visit to Boston,
I counted in the phonebook 86 people of Italian descent in the metropolitan
area whose male ancestors years ago had been given the institutionally pro­
vided name Esposito-sometimes Exposito, but always meaning "an exposed
one."36 In "Les Pages Blanches" for Paris    I 996 there were 46 Espositos,   I
Esposti, 2 Espostos, 8 variants on Degli Esposti, 64 Trouves, plus-as if to
advertise just how this family's fortunes have improved-one listing for a
family business that read: "Trouve, Per et Fils."
    Desperation, Destitution, Self-Delusion
When parents left infants at foundling homes, did they know what they were
doing? At the outset, when an infant was left there by an unmarried woman
(likely to be destitute) or sent in by desperately poor people from the coun­
tryside, it's possible that the baby would actually have a better chance of
surviving at the foundling home than with its mother. Many foundlings in
Renaissance Florence were illegitimate children of slaves or domestics and, as
such, would have died at three times the average rate. Such abandonments
could be construed to be in the child's best interests. But w hat about deci­
sions made after mortality at the foundling homes rose to the catastrophic
levels that they almost inevitably did, as more and more mothers made the
same choice. When mothers set their infants in the barrel and rang the bell,
did they have any idea how staggering the mortality rates were? Surviving
documents from fifteenth-century Florence suggest that parents not only had
some idea that foundling homes were dangerous places, but some even made
shrewd suggestions in an attempt to tip the balance in favor of their infant's
survival. Some left pathetic instructions begging personnel at the Innocenti
to send this baby to some outside wet nurse, not keep it at the hospital, where
chances of survival were worse. 37
    Volker Hunecke records case studies from eighteenth- and nineteenth­
century Milan for tailor "Filippo A   --   " and his wife, who kept their first
son at home and then deposited the next six (in the space of five and a half
years) at the nearest tour. When his first wife died, he remarried "Cecilia
B --    " and together they deposited five more infants in five years. After a
year and a half, the mother tried to retrieve them, but only two of all these
                   MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
children were still alive. "Francesco G   --    " and his wife "Amalia S  --   "
similarly produced twelve children in thirteen years. The first died soon after
birth, all the others went to foundling homes. Only one daughter survived.
The point here is that these parents had the information to know that things at
the foundling home had not gone well; and, being human, they would have
communicated their misfortune to others.
    After a point, parents had to have known. But they were making decisions
based on immediate costs (discovery, in the case of an unwed mother; lost
wages; destitution) rather than on the basis of rumored misfortunes behind
distant walls. In doing so, they relied on the all-too-human gift of fantasy and
self-delusion. Hetty cries that she did not mean to kill her child. Mothers
who left their infants at foundling homes found solace by fantasizing fabulous
destinies of upward social mobility for abandoned progeny, who like Romu­
lus and Remus, the abandoned twins supposedly adopted by a she-wolf,
might be miraculously saved and survive to found a dynasty.
    Questioning Maternal Instinct
Decades before the sudden-infant-death-syndrome scandals surfaced in the
 199os, or before data from the foundling homes started to be quantified in
the 197os, psychiatrists, historians, and social scientists all noted the poor
match between real-life mothers and the nineteenth- and early-twentieth­
century stereotypes of instinctively nurturing mothers. Feminists in particu­
lar had long ago lost patience with Darwinian perspectives that struck them
as essentialist and which patently disregarded women's felt experience . They
were eager to discount biological explanations, and had little incentive to
keep up with what was going on in reproductive ecology or sociobiology.
They continued to project onto these fields their own worst assessments
about essentialist and determinist assessments of "female nature" even after
biologists themselves had abandoned these types of explanations. The result
was that feminist theorists were producing models to explain what was
essentially a biological phenomenon (namely, the failure of an infant to elicit
nurturing responses from its mother) but without any reference to biology.
They used the evidence of high numbers of non-nurturing mothers as a tool
to jettison altogether the confining stereotype of the instinctively nurturing
mother that had long been used to prescribe social roles for women.
                          UNNATURAL          MOTHERS
Instead of taking a closer, critical look at the original, biologically based
explanations to sec if perhaps something had been left out, feminists (along
with other social scientists who were trying to explain the widespread
practice of abandonment by mothers) patently rejected evolutionary expla­
nations. The biological basis for motherhood was replaced by a new environ­
mentalism. The way a mother feels toward her infant must be solely
determined by her cultural milieu.
     In France, where this view of "socially constructed" mothers originated
and then gradually spread, a hrilliant and animated philosopher, Elisabeth
Badinter, in 1 98o the first woman to become a professor at Paris's prestigious
Ecole Polytechnique, and an appropriately iconoclastic descendant of Cle­
mence Royer, could stare straight into the eyes of a reporter from the Nou­
,·elle Obsen·ateur and say: "I am not questioning maternal love"-pause, for she
knows what comes next will be scandalous-"[ am questioning maternal
instinct."l8
     Although David Lack's ideas about the tradeoffs mothers in nature make
were by then built into sociobiology (discussed above, in chapter 2), most
social scientists still assumed that in nature, mammal mothers instinctively
and automatically care for every infant they produce. Badinter's reasoning
was simple. If mother love is instinctive, all normal mothers should be loving.
However, if the vast majority of mothers in eighteenth-century France had
opted not to rear their own infants but to delegate their care to inadequate
wet nurses instead, this was more mothers than could reasonably be dis­
missed as aberrations. Furthermore, Badinter knew that not all these women
were unwed and destitute. It was also apparent that children related to par­
ents to the same degree were not being treated in the same way, which to her
could not be consistent with a biological basis for maternal love.
     Such maternal love as Badinter could document was often discriminatory
and selective. A wet nurse might be brought in from the outside to nurse an
older son while the younger son was sent far away. If not spontaneous and
automatic, Badinter argued, maternal love had to be a nonbiological social
construction. It was a sentiment produced by a particular cultural context,
peculiar to a specific historical time and place. Her best-selling book on the
"myth" of a mother's instinctive love for her infants stressed the fact that
although many mothers who abandoned infants or sent them to wet nurses
were destitute, many others were "bourgeois" mothers whose banishment of
their babies was discretionary. (I will return to this topic in chapter '4·)

    Social Construction of Mother Love
The idea caught on among social historians that "good mothering," even the
concept of childhood itself, must be a recent cultural invention. 39 Social his­
torians like Philippe Aries in France and Edward Shorter in the United States
hypothesized that parental emotions and the internal workings of family life
derived from particular attitudes and customs. Such customs are built up and
change over time. Not only do such cultural constructions take on a life of
their own, they were never influenced by biology. It was a model that could
safely eschew any discussion of an evolved human nature. 40
    Fired by the notion that parental attitudes change over time, the American
psychohistorian Lloyd de Mause compiled masses of evidence on infanticide
and abandonment in earlier times. Childhood, he announced, was actuallv     J
                                                                              "a
nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken." He laid out a
succession of stages, beginning with an"infanticidal mode" prior to the fourth
century A.D., when parents "routinely resolved their anxieties about taking
care of children by killing them." By the eighteenth century a phase of"intru­
sive" child-rearing ushered in by reformers led to the child being "nursed by
the mother, not swaddled, not given regular enemas, toilet trained early,
prayed with but not played with, hit but not regularly whipped, punished for
masturbation, made to obey promptly," culminating in the "socialization
mode" of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when newly empathetic
parents became more concerned with training than conquering children, and
today 's modern"heI pmg ·   mod e.'141
    Anthropologists as well were inclined to set aside Rousseau, Spencer, and
the various essentialists. They followed the historians, divorcing maternal
emotions from biological predispositions and situating them in particular
economic and political contexts.
   "Anthropologist Calls Mother Love a Bourgeois Myth," announced one
headline. 42 Years of studying desperately poor mothers in Brazilian shanty­
towns as they distanced themselves from doomed children and watched them
die had convinced Nancy Scheper- Hughes that"Mother love is anything other
than natural and instead represents a matrix of images, meanings, senti­
ments, and practices that arc everywhere socially and culturally produced."
She vividly describes how mothers convince themselves that their children
lack the will to live, and how they subsequently draw back. The cultural art of
breast-feeding, she decided, had been lost, so that the baby is fed powdered
formula diluted with water teeming with diarrhea-inducing microorganisms.

\Vhen, almost inevitably, death ensues, motl1e1·s do not disguise their grief
behind a stoic f<H;:adc-they feel none. "The traumatized individual," writes
Scheper-Hughes in Death Without Weepin,q, docs not "shrug her shoulders and
say cheerily, 'It's better the baby should die than either you or me.'" Rather
(paraphrasing GeneralW illiam Westmoreland's famous observation about his
allies during the Vietnam war),"They do not grieve the way we do."We err,
she argues, by attributing to Third World women "a very specific cultural
'norm' [of maternal love) from our own Bourgeois society.'>43
    Universality of Parental Emotions
Scholar after scholar detailed massive mortality owing to such "unnatural
mothers," then sought to ascribe the absence of maternal commitment to cul­
tural constructs-attitudes or historical factors peculiar to particular peri­
ods: the absence of a "concept of childhood";44 the notion that"mother love"
had not yet been invented;45 mothers conditioned to expect children to die;46
pressure put on unwed mothers by the Catholic Church,47 together with the
creation of foundling homes that serve as magnets for abandoning parents;
unprecedented population growth (the doubling of the human population
between 1650 and        1 850 );48 colonial and capitalist oppression to explain
lethal child neglect in the Third World today;49 and so on. These circum­
stances were indeed highly pertinent. Historical and ecological context had
important implications for how mothers assessed what their own, or this par­
ticular infant's, prospects were. Social and economic context had everything
to do with what alternatives a mother had to choose from. But whereas these
represent highly relevant circumstances, they are not explanations for why
mothers were abandoning babies. And in the debates over the construction of
"mother love," such variation in maternal responses by no means disproved
the involvement of innate mechanisms. Indeed, understanding the biological
basis of"mother love" is essential for understanding what is going on here.
Long before populations in western Europe burgeoned, well prior to the
eighteenth-century boom in sending children away to wet nurses or aban­
doning them outright, European parents sought ways to cope with unwanted
children. Around the world, hunter-gatherer societies have suffered high
rates of child mortality without compromising close mother-infant relation-

ships."Their death made me feel pain," moaned Nisa,the !Kung mother,in a
culture where on average so percent of children die before adulthood-and
 I oo percent of hers had. "Eh,Mother! I almost died of that pain ."50
    Hundreds of British and American diaries kept by literate parents (alas,
mostly fathers) between I soo and I 900 reveal the same continuum of emo­
tions-from indulgent to abusive, distant to engrossed-that one finds in
cross-sections of parents today.51 Further back in time the record grows
skimpy. But such accounts as exist tell the same story,albeit from a male per­
spective,since few mothers left written diaries."How great a joy it was to me
and his mother; and soon came his movements in the womb which I noted
carefully with my hand,awaiting his birth with the greatest eagerness," wrote
Giovanni Morelli,a fourteenth-century father from middle-class urban Italy.
Morelli sounds like a textbook example of the modern "engrossed " father­
supposedly a historical novelty.
    And then when he was born,male,sound,well-proportioned,what
    happiness,what joy I experienced; and then as he grew from good to
    better,such satisfaction,such pleasure in his childish words,pleasing to
    all,loving towards me his father and his mother,precocious for his
    age. 52
How profoundly modern as well sound the guilty self-recriminations of the
same father when his beloved firstborn,Alberto, dies in I4-o6 at age ten: "You
had a son,intelligent,lively,and healthy so that your anguish was greater at
his loss," he berates himself."You loved him ...but treated him more like a
stranger than a son . .. you never looked approvingly at him . .. you never
kissed him when he wanted it ....You have lost him and will never see him
again in this world."53
    In I 74-6, Madame d'Epinay sounds like the woman next door when she
writes of her new baby: "I think of nothing but this little creature from morn­
ing till evening."Advantaged enough to hire both a governess and a tutor,she
chose to breast-feed the baby herself and was so attentive to his needs that
he developed "a passion for having me always near him.He cries when I leave
him .... I sometimes think when he smiles as he looks at me ...that there
is no satisfaction equal to that of making one's fellow creature happy."This
obvious bond between mother and infant blossomed during the historical

Fig. 12.8 Women like Madame d'Epinay were following the advice of Jean-Jacques Rousseau
"Man of Nature" ( r 71 2-78 ). He admonished men who "cannot fulfill the duties of a father" not
"to become one_" Nothing, he wrote "can dispense (a father] from caring for his children and
bringing them up himself." He offered this ad\ice later in life, after he himself was no longer a
poor writer seeking to better himself. Rousseau was rationalizing to himself how it was that all
five of his children ended up in foundling homes. At the time he noted that the arrangement
"seemed to me so good, so sensible, so appropriate, that if I did not boast of it publicly it was
solely out of regard for their mother....All things considered, I chose what was best for my chil­
dren,or what I thought was best." All in all, Rousseau mused in his Reveries, it was quite lucky for
the children, because if they had been left with their mother they would ha\'e been spoiled by her
and transformed into "monsters." It was a matter of "principle" for him to do what he did. Uke
other early moral philosophers, Rousseau was strong on what it was biologically "natural" for
mothers to do, and took for granted both that "in the animal kingdom the laws of nature reign
unencumbered.";4 He also took for granted that he knew what those laws were. (En aravinabyAu gusre

to languish, often to die, far from home. 55
    When Circumstances Change
Most telling perhaps are real-world case histories that allow us to ask: W hat
happens when the same mothers, with the same social constructs, are placed
in different circumstances? Among the Ayorco Indians of Bolivia earlier in
this century, following a period of grave social disruption (the Chaco War,
between Bolivia and Paraguay, 1932-35) nearly every woman in one village
had committed infanticide. Between them, the women in this sample
had buried alive 38 percent of all infants born. One mother code-named
"Asago" viewed her first three husbands as poor prospects for long-term sup­
port and buried at birth thefirst six if the ten children she bore in her lifetime.
Yet infants born to women who had managed to forge stable relationships, or
who, having grown older, had decided to proceed with a family no matter
what, were loved and cherished. "Even when trained as an anthropologist,"
the ethnographers noted, "it is difficult to believe that someone known as a
charming friend, devoted wife, and doting mother could do something that
one's own culture deems repugnant."56 Across cultures-in South America,
New Guinea, Europe-the same mother who regretfully eliminates a poorly
timed neonate wil1 lovingly care for later ones if circumstances improve.
Indeed, among both the Ayoreo and North Americans in Martin Daly and
Margo W ilson's sample of infanticidal mothers, those under the age of twenty
were the most likely to respond to poor circumstances by committing infan­
ticide, while older mothers were far less likely to do so. 57
    How a mother, particularly a very young mother, treats one infant turns
out to be a poor predictor of how she might treat another one born when she
is older, or faced with improved circumstances. Even with culture held con­
stant, observing modern Western women all inculcated with more or less the
same post-Enlightenment values, maternal age turned out to be a better pre­
dictor of how effective a mother would be than specific personality traits or
attitudes. Older women describe motherhood as more meaningful, are more
likely to sacrifice themselves on behalf of a needy child, and mourn lost preg­
nancies more than do younger women-presumably because the latter fore-

    Sometimes an improvement in circumstances leads to an entirely different
child-care style. Nancy Schepcr-Hughes describes a poor Brazilian woman
                        UNNATURAL           MOTHERS
who finally finds herself attached to a husband with a small hut predictable
income . Spontaneously, this woman reinvents the "bourgeois" concept of
mother lo,·e and readopts the lost ar t of breast-feeding, which supposedly
had disappeared from her shantytown subculture. She invests emotionally
and financiallY in each child, and marvels at the outcome: "Fmm then on

almost all our babies lived."�9
    Unintended Experiment at La Maternite
EYen when circumstances remain grim, extended contact between mother
and infant (especially if the mother is breast-feeding) can elicit emotions that
undermine the strongest pragmatic resolve. Social historian Rachel Fuchs,
whose research deals with the effect of public policies on infant abandon­
ment, describes an unusual experiment that resulted from an attempt at
social engineering undertaken in Paris in the years I 830-69. It dates from the
time when Europe's epidemic of abandonment was winding down.60
    Exceedingly poor women who could not afford a midwife gave birth at La
Maternite, the major state-run charity hospital in the Seine region. The hos­
pital was directly across the street from the Hospice des Enfants Assistes, the
only place around where infants could be abandoned legally. In an effort to
reduce the numbers of abandoned babies, a group of French reformers came
up with a plan. A subset of indigent women was obliged to remain with their
infants for eight days after birth. What most people would consider unethical
manipulation today produced remarkable results. Under this "experimental"
regimen, the proportion of destitute mothers who subsequently abandoned
their babies dropped from 24- to I o percent. Neither their cultural concepts
about babies nor their economic circumstances had changed. What changed
was the degree to which they had become attached to their breast-feeding
infants. It was as though their decision to abandon their babies and their
attachment to their babies operated as two different systems.
   Fuchs's analysis is consistent with this interpretation. Infants whose desti­
tute mothers left the hospital on the day of birth had a fifty-to-one chance of
being left behind. Infants whose mothers left just two days later had a six-to­
one chance of being abandoned.
    Underpinnings of Contingent Commitment
A mother's commitment to her infant-and in the case of humans, this is
what we mean by "mother lO\·e"-is neither a myth nor a cultural construct.
                   MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
As with other mammals, a mother's emotional commitment to her infant
can be highly contingent on ecologically and historically produced circum­
stances. No one knows how the underlying mechanisms work. But it is a rea­
sonable guess that such mechanisms involve thresholds for responding to
infant cues. These would be endocrinologically and neurologically set, possi­
bly during pregnancy and prior to birth, rendering a mother more or less
likely to become engaged by infantile cues as she makes decisions about how
much of herself to invest in her infant.
    Most mothers remain close to their infants in the period after birth, and
over a period of days, weeks, and months the attachment between mother
and infant grows stronger. But some mothers are so detached at birth that
their own actions ensure this never happens-a situation rendered far less
common in apes and monkeys than in humans since (and this may not be the
only reason) neonates are able to catch hold of the mother's fur and cling to
her from birth long enough for backup. systems related to maternal respon­
siveness to kick in. Such cases of "unnatural"-seeming abandoning mothers
offer far more insight into the underlying processes than do the more usual
cases where babies are born, picked up, and cared for.
    Across primates, including humans, wherever mothers abandon babies,
they almost invariably do so within the first seventy-two hours-as in the
case of Lynn Fairbanks's "teenage" vervet mothers, or the hyperfertile captive
tamarin mothers with inadequate allomaternal assistance. This does not nec­
essarily mean that there is a critical period right after birth during which
mothers must bond or else. Rather, what it suggests is that close proximity
between mother and infant during this period produces feelings in the
mother about her baby that make abandonment unbearable. (I discuss this in

Far from invalidating biological bases for maternal behavior, a closer look at
the historical and ethnographic record reveals mothers who respond to a range
of circumstances with a fairly predictable range of emotions. Their responses
to infants remain consistent across vast spans of time and space, in the face of
bewilderingly variable social histories. These consistencies remind us that we
descend from creatures for whom the timing of reproduction has always
made an enormous difference, and that the physiological and motivational

underpinnings of a quintessentially "pro-choice" mammal are not new. These
consistencies in maternal nature transcend historical peculiarities, and the
''agarics of local ecologies and demography. It was not the response of moth­
ers in ancient Rome, or eighteenth-century France, or twentieth-century
Brazil that was unnatural. In fact, what was unnatural was the unusually high
proportion of Yery young females, or females under dismal circumstances,
who, in the absence of other forms of birth control, conceived and carried to
term babies unlikely to prosper.
     In the next chapter I explore circumstances under which mothers treat
offspring differently not because of when in the mother's life they happen to
be born, but because the baby is born one sex or the other. The mothers
im·olved are not necessarily immature or poor. Many have mates or kin net­
works to help support them, or are otherwise well-positioned to rear their
baby. Indeed, in many of the best-documented cases of sex-selected infanti­
cide, elites-those with the most resources, not the least- are implicated.

         eventy thousand calories, nine months, seventeen-plus years of
         room, board, and extras-and yes, there is a charge. Parents expect
         returns from their investment in children. How often have you over­
heard a parent telling a child that he or she is "a disgrace,""good for nothing,"
or complaining that a son or daughter "will never amount to much"? How
many parents have entertained such thoughts themselves? "It's for your own
good." Or especially, "I just want you to live up to your potential."Talking to
young people this way is so commonplace that it has become routine fare in
melodramas. What is at issue here?
    There is a contract stored deep in the minds of parents: they expect those
to whom they give so much to bring credit to the family name, or to translate
parental investment into either cultural success or its former correlate:
enhanced fitness for the lineage. Parents may justify their behavior by claim­
ing to act in "the child's interests." Closer scrutiny often reveals parents defin­
ing those interests in line with their own.
    In the West, such conflicts have tended to he over education, inheritances,
career decisions, social or sexual choices. Parental preferences rarely place
infants in mortal peril. Elsewhere, though, parents literally sacrifice children
to family goals. Nowhere are underlying tensions more manifest than in soci­
eties where parents resort to sex-selective infanticide in order to obtain spe­
cific family configurations.
    China's Missing Daughters
In 1991, results from China's massive census of e\'ery hundredth household
became available, sparking worldwide comment. "Where have the girls
gonc?"1 It is normal for slightly more boys than girls to be horn: 1 04 to 1 o6
            DAUGHTERS          OR    SONS?     IT   ALL   DEPENDS             319
boys per 1 oo girls is considered normal. But comparisons of expected sex
ratios with those from China's 1990 census revealed that out of a total 1. 2 bil­
lion people, millions of girls that should have been counted seemed either not
to have been born, not to have been reported as born, or else eliminated so
soon after birth as to escape notice in the census. Instead of the expected 1 o6
sex ratio there were 1 1 1 boys per 1 oo girls. Perhaps Asians arc genetically
disposed to produce more sons than other people, some suggested. 2 Demog­
raphers, however, arc convinced that girls are being eliminated on a massive
scale, either through prenatal sex determination followed by selective abor­
tion of female fetuses, or through nconaticide. 3
    Later-born children are most at risk. Westerners assume that the one­
child-per-family policy means that Chinese families only have one or at most
two children. But that is not necessarily the case, especially in rural areas.
Dispensations for extra offspring can also be obtained-especially for par­
ents who only have girls. But often a fine is imposed, and many families arc
reluctant to bear penalties for an extra child without getting the sex they
want.4
    Either sex may be acceptable for the first birth. This explains why the cur­
rent Chinese sex ratio for first births is within the normal range- I o6 boys
reported for every    1 oo girls. For higher birth orders, however, sex ratios
start to climb. For families producing a fifth child, 1 25 male births arc
reported for every 1 oo daughters. 5
    Policy to Blame-or Parental Preferences?
Viewed in historical perspective, China's one-child policy has enhanced the
well-being of wanted children and helped the country to catch up economi­
cally. 6 But small families also increased pressure for a son. China's "missing
daughters" have become an international cause celebre, with special condem­
nation resen-cd for the one-child policy itself.
    Female infanticide, however, was practiced long before Mao's population
policies were introduced in the second half of the twentieth century. In
southern regions like the Lower Yangtze, where Shanghai is situated, the only
plausible explanation for so many missing daughters is either sex-selective
abortion or infanticide. 7 Infanticide rates are higher today than ten years ago,
but they arc lower than in centuries past. In some areas, childhood sex ratios
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were as high as 1 54: 1 oo. 8 In large
J20                             MOTHERS    AND  ALLOMOTHERS
cities like Beijing, wagons made scheduled rounds in the early morning to
collect corpses of unwanted daughters that had been soundlessly drowned in
a bucket of milk while the mother looked away. 9 One nineteenth-century
woman interviewed recalled eliminating eleven newborn daughters. Another
could not recall the exact number, except that she had borne more daughters
                               10
than she wanted.
     Such anti-daughter prejudice was scarcely new. A Chinese poem recited
2,s-oo years ago celebrated the arrival of a son who should be dressed in fin­
ery, laid on an elaborate bed, and given a jade insignia to hold. A daughter, by
contrast, would be dressed in a wrapper, laid on the ground, and given a
wooden whirligig. According to a popular proverb: "More sons, the more
         .                        . "II
happmess and prospenty.
     Whether current distortions in China's sex ratios are due to selective
abortion of female fetuses or female infanticide, existing laws are not effec­
tive. Sex ratios are most skewed in remote rural areas. Labor provided by
sons is more essential there, and laws harder to enforce. The strongest skews
are found in southern China, where discrimination against daughters was tra­
                                        12
ditionally more pronounced.
     The call for more and tougher laws detracts attention from the underly ing
problem: long-standing parental desires for a particular family composition.
This means that unwanted infants, if they survive, are likely to grow into
unwanted children who will be fed last and fed least, have less attention paid
to their education and medical needs, and suffer phy sical and emotional
abuse. A more effective and humane solution would focus on changing paren­
tal mindsets. But how? Ongoing propaganda campaigns-for example, the
signs posted all over proclaiming "Little Boy, Little Girl, Both Okay"-have
had limited impact.

    A Widespread and Very Ancient Bias
The first step is to understand what ancient and deep-rooted parental prefer­
ences for sons versus daughters are about. Sex ratios as high as those found in
China today ( 1 16: I oo ) can be documented for other Asian countries that do
not have such coercive family planning.   13 Far beyond the boundaries of China,
wherever prefe ren ces for offspring of one sex arc so extreme that sex­
selective infanticide is practiced (in about 9 percent of the world's cultures),
                            14
sons are the desired sex.
    Outside of China, female infanticide is well documented for other parts of
Asia, among tribes in highland New Guinea and South America, as well as in
ancient Italy. Wherever it is found, extreme son preference and the devalua­
tion of daughters that accompanies it go hand in hand with patriarchal ideolo­
gies.Indifference to the fates of daughters can be stunning, as evidenced by
the note of a Roman soldier sent his wife in the first century B.C.:
    I ask and beg you to take good care of our baby son.. . .If you are
    delivered of child ... if it is a boy keep it, if a girl discard it. 15
In India, special mantras from the Veda, sacred texts of Hinduism, are still
chanted when a wife becomes pregnant. If by some mischance the fetus is
female, this text expresses the hope that she will be magically transformed
             16
into a son.
    Various well-meaning pundits have proposed letting the "mania for sons"
take its course. Playwright, congresswoman, and ambassador Clare Boothe
Luce was among the most outspoken of them.She correctly noted that the
Chinese desire for sons motivated parents to have larger families, since those
with only daughters kept trying for sons. She proposed a "male-child birth
pill" as the "quickest way of peacefully slowing down the [population) clock."
Furthermore, Luce suggested, as daughters became scarcer, the status of
women would rise.
    Laws of supply and demand, however, do not always work, especially not
where odds are stacked against a sex that is not only scarce but is socially dis­
enfranchised. In urban China, scarcity has indeed provided women with
undreamed-of opportunities. In television broadcasts that fall somewhere
between The DatinB Game and talent shows, desperate bachelors make their
appeals, then anxiously await a summons, as female viewers choose among
potential mates.But the very same scarcity that drives urban bachelors to
 322                MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
these extremes makes women's lives more perilous than ever in rural areas.
The incidence of rape, kidnap, and even women being bought and sold, has
risen along with the number of wifeless men. 17 Women may be in short sup­
ply, but as a class they arc no better off. In I 991), China was the only country
                                                                               8
in the world where the suicide rate for women exceeded the rate for men.1
For parts of the world where "a daughter's birth makes even a philosophical
man ... gloomy !while] a son's birth is like sunrise in the abode of gods,"19
prenatal sex diagnosis with the option of selective abortion arrived on the
scene like a divine gift.The old proverb according to which "eighteen goddess­
like daughters are not equal to one son with a hump" is taken quite literally by
parents who use prenatal diagnosis not to guard against genetic defects , but
against paired XX chromosomes. Of 8,ooo abortions performed at a clinic in
India, 7, 997 eliminated fetuses parents had been told would be daughters.
(Typically, mothers being tested already had one or more daughters.)20
    Officially, such discrimination is banned. Asian countries have far stricter
laws against using prenatal tests this way than do Western countries. 21 But the
laws are unenforceable. In     I 988 Maharashtra state in south India banned
all prenatal sex determinations. India's Parliament followed suit. In 1994,
nationwide penalties of three years in prison and a fine (equal to about $32 o)
were imposed on anyone found guilty of administering or taking prenatal
tests solely to determine the sex of a fetus. Korea followed suit the same year,
making it a crime to abort a female fetus. Such laws notwithstanding, volun­
teer organizations in India estimate that around 8o,ooo abortions after sex
tests arc still performed every year (surely an underestimate). The situation is
similar in Korea. Meanwhile in the poorest areas of Asia, where prenatal test­
ing is largely unavailable (e.g. , in Tamil Nadu o1· Rajasthan in India), female
infanticide continues. Unwanted daughters may be dispatched either the tra­
ditional way (by smearing opium on the mother's nipples or by poisoning
with plant extracts) or the "modern" way-denying a daughter breast milk ,
                                                                         2
so that she dies of unavoidable (and unprosccutable) "natural" causes. 2
    How Much Say Do Mothers Have?
How could a mother, a woman herself, kill a daughter because her baby is
female? To discriminate on these gr ounds would seem to validate her own

inferiority. It is interesting to note that in places like China and Bangladesh
daughters are most at risk in families that already have one or more daugh­
ters-in precisely those families where the mother has already nursed a
daughter. She can remember what it was like to love a baby girl. It is hard to
believe, yet maternal compliance with daughter infanticide cannot be under­
stood without taking into account her situation. 24 She lives with her husband,
                   MOTHERS         AND   ALLOMOTHERS
among his relatives, dependent upon them. The well-being of the children
she rears will rely on their good will. Quite simply, the men of the family
wanted sons, therefore so did the women. From an early age, these women
were conditioned to place their hopes on sons they would bear one day, and
on the sons born to their sons.
                                25
    Even today, in many societies mothers without sons are pitied and looked
down upon. Wives with sons are more highly prized, their male children
favored. "Soon after I delivered my son, my parents-in-law moved us into a
larger apartment," recalled one Korean woman who happened to be a winner
in this chromosomal lottery. Such pervasive conditioning makes it impossible
to view maternal preferences separately from her husband's family's inter­
ests. 26 One modern mother who disapproved of this prejudice nevertheless
voluntarily opted for an (illegal) abortion when told that her second child
would be another daughter. She knew girls were scarce, but after agonizing,
still chose not to bear another daughter. Often, the matter is literally taken
out of a mother's hands, as in the case of the Pakistani twins where the
mother-in-law bottle-feeds the daughter, consigning the girl (but not breast­
fed son) to die of dy sentery and malnutrition (see figure 13.2).
    Such cases led anthropologist Susan Scrimshaw to argue in a much cited
passage that "the decline of infanticide may result in more suffering for older
infants and children, and even adults, than when an infant's fate, be it life or
death, was determined swiftly, early and irrevocably." Scrimshaw was not
advocating infanticide. Rather, she was making a realistic and compassionate

    Reasons for Preferring Sons
"Daughters are no better than crows" observes a Tibetan proverb. Variations
on this theme can be heard throughout northern India. "Their parents feed
them and when they get their wings, they fly away."29 Daughters, people com­
plain, leave at marriage; resources devoted to rearing them are lost to the
patriline. With them depart substantial dowries, enriching their husbands'
families while impoverishing their own. Parents dread the prospect of marry ­
ing off several daughters almost (but not quite) as much as they dread poten-
            DAUGHTERS OR SONS?                  IT  ALL DEPENDS                 .325
tial disgrace should a daughter fail to marry into a family of appropriate sta­
tus, or be seduced and left pregnant but unmarried.
    By itself, the "daughters depart" rationale begs the question of why the
system is set up this way, with sons staying, daughters decamping. Nor docs it
explain why parents ,·oluntarily fork over exorbitant dowries. Attention,
then, gravitates to the traditional rationales for son preference, explanations
of "pride and purse," sons' special labor value, the ritual role accorded to
sons, and their symbolic value.
    In one of the few studies of its kind, Mead Caine of the Population Coun­
cil of New York quantified the value of labor provided by sons as compared
with daughters in Bangladesh. By ten to thirteen years of age, a boy is a net
producer. By age fifteen a son has repaid his parents for what it cost them to
rear him, and by age twenty-one repaid them for one sister as well. Daugh­
ters, by contrast, though they work early and hard, leave home before they
repay parental outlays. 30
    By themselves, neither family "pride" nor "purse" (economic interests)
explains why sons earn more in the first place, why parents continue to favor
them, or why parents send daughters away with large dowries.
    The Reproductive Potential ofSons
A long history of male-male competition for mates has left a sexually selected
legacy of men who are somewhat larger, and much more muscular, than
women. This is one reason men make more effective allies than women. The
other is that in patrilocal breeding systems, these allies will also be kin.
Whether protecting access to females in the community or helping to main­
tain a patriline's rights over sources of production, males have greater
"resource holding ability."This fact of life is not lost on parents in parts of the
world where possession has long been ten-tenths of what law there is, and
where resources have been inseparably linked to family survival through
time. Where "sons are guns" (an old Rajasthani saying), the alternative to
passing property to sons who can defend it against competing lineages is to
lose control of a legacy.
    In patriarchal social systems, a wealthy son finds himself in control of
productive resources that women need. He will be in a position to attract
multiple mates. In a stratified society such as Rajasthan's, families seeking
social advancement compete among themselves to amass a dowry large
 J26                 MOTHERS        AND   ALLOMOTHERS
enough to secure a place for their daughter in an elite household. This brings
a prestigious alliance for parents along with the prospect of well-endowed
grandsons. Should calamity strike, it is the only prospect for descendants
surviving at all. Thus does son preference among elites lead to hypergamy,
the custom by which women marry men of higher status. At the top of the
hierarchy, however, hypergamy dooms daughters. There is no higher-ranking
family for them to marry into. 31
    Selective elimination of daughters first attracted attention in the West
during the years of the British Raj. Nineteenth-century travelers visiting
Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in northern India remarked on the rarity of see­
ing girls among any of the elite clans. It was assumed that as part of purdah
the daughters of these proud descendants of warrior-kings were kept in
seclusion. "I have been nearly four years in India and never beheld any women
but those in attendance as servants in European families, the low caste wives
of petty shopkeepers and [dancing] women," wrote Fanny Parks in her I 850
travelogue through northern India. It did not occur to the observer that there
 were no daughters. 32
    Bit by bit, the light dawned. One British official stumbled on the phenom­
enon of missing daughters while engaged in negotiations with local land­
owners. He mistakenly referred to one of these mustachioed men as the
son-in-law of the other, evoking sarcastic laughter. This was scarcely possible,
they told him. The birth of a daughter would be such a calamity to families of
their rank that she would never survive. It was unthinkable that any of their
daughters would reach marriageable age. Among the most elite clans such as
the Jhareja Rajputs and the Bedi Sikhs-known locally as the Kuri Mar, or
"daughter destroyers"-censuses confirmed the near total absence of daugh­
ters; lesser elites killed only later born daughters. Overall, including lower­
ranking clans who kept some or all daughters, sex ratios in the region were as
high as 400 little boys surviving for every I oo girls.
    Public outrage against infimticide among nineteenth-century Britons hack
home led to the anti-infanticide laws of the 1 8 70s. British colonial legislation
reduced infanticide but did little to alleviate the often lethal neglect of girls
who survived. When a nineteenth-century British official asked a landholder
from Uttar Pradesh why the majority of Rajput families continued to elimi­
nate their daughters in spite of British laws against it, his reply was to the
point: "The father who preserves a daughter will never live to sec her suitably

be ruined." The man tlwn \\'('Ill on to itemize specific cases confirming his
point that "those who preserve their daughters never prosper" and end by los-

    In a world fraught with ecological peril, recurring droughts, famines, and
warfare, the best hope for long-term persistence of a lineage was concentra­
tion of resources in a strong, well-situated male heir with several wives o1·
concubines. If family circumstances make this tactic doubtful, a daughter or
two provide insurance against total extinction of the family line.If a family is
truly wretched, the best it can hope for is that daughters will be able, as
slaYes, wives, or concubines, to move up the social scale into positions where
their children might possibly survive. Such sy stems did not originate because
men sought to sire as many offspring as possible, although many did. Rather,
the goal-both subliminal and consciously stated-was to ensm·e that at least
some of their own lineage, "honor" and advantages intact, were represented
in subsequent generations. Ultimately, this conservative course tended to
prevent local extinction of the family, and in that way was correlated long­
term with lineage survival.
    From turbaned warriors on the dusty plains of Rajasthan to modern
urbanites, we arc endlessly fascinated by how families fare over time. Witness
the worldwide popularity of such TV programs as Dallas, Falcon Crest, and
Dynasty. Whether it is a television family or their own, people arc easily
drawn in. They want to know how different characters will fare in the high­
stakes game of marriage, reproduction, and maintaining access to resources.
Who will suni\·e and prevail? Who succumb? People discuss such matters ad
nauseam.Voyeurs and gossips weigh the merits of alternative solutions to
each family's posterity problems.We arc a species obsessed hy strategies of
heirship, and superbly equipped to devise them.34
    In nineteenth-century Rajasthan, where periodic droughts and famines
were a certainty, sunh·al of family lines required extreme measures.Heart­
less? Definitely. And ruthless. But prevailing rules for deciding which sex off­
spring will contribute most to family ends were devised over generations.
Outcomes of successive trial and error, obser vation of the trials of others,
imitation of those who succeed-these became codified as preferences
for particular family sy stems. Adaptive solutions were retained as custom
because families that followed these rules survived and prospered.  lS

    Ideology Alone Cannot Explain Sex Preferences
Sex preferences obviously have a lot to do with ideologies. Yet if genetic sur­
vival of family lines is at stake, evolutionists would expect a biological basis
for the underlying emotions. They would also expect parents in other species
to bias investment by sex as well.
    Animals have no traffic with symbolism, gender constructs, or concepts
like "old age insurance." Hence it is sobering to discover that humans arc not
the only creatures shaping offspring sets to achieve particular compositions.
When they can, many animal mothers bias sex ratios prior to conception,
selectively abort fetuses, and differentially nurture sons and daughters.
Humans are merely the only animals to do so consciously and to articulate
reasons for their biases. Only the mechanisms differ. As Aldous Huxley put it:
"Ends are ape-chosen; only the means are man's."
    One difficulty with research on sex ratios is that unless the sample sizes
are very large, it can be devilishly difficult to be sure that small fluctuations in
the proportion of sons and daughters are not due to chance. Under a range
of circumstances, birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals invest differentially in
daughters and sons. It is instructive to take a closer look at the pattern of sex­
biased parental investment in these other animals before returning to the
question of why humans bias sex ratios as they do, using techniques as crude,
cruel, and wasteful as many routinely do. Far more efficient mechanisms for
biasing sex ratios prior to birth arc evolutionarily feasible. Fig wasp mothers,
for example, evolved the capacity to custom-configure the sex ratios of their
clutches. (See p. 6 5.) Somehow assessing which sex offspring will be repro­
ductively most advantageous, the mother adds or withholds Y-bcaring sperm
as she lays each egg. When William Hamilton published his               1 967 paper
"Extraordinary Sex Ratios," he launched one of the wildest and woolliest pur­
suits within evolutionary biology, known as "sex ratio theory."
    More "Extraordinary Sex Ratios"
In turtles, alligators, crocodiles, and many fish, a mother's task is simple. Sex
is not predetermined when the egg is laid hut gradually crystallizes during
embryonic development, determined by temperature or other environmen­
tal conditions. A mother American alligator, for example, ensures that most
of her eggs hatch female simply by locating her nest in a sunny spot. If, on the
other hand, she clambers ashore and lays her eggs in a shady part of the
            DAUGHTERS OR SONS?                IT  ALL DEPENDS               329
beach, her eggs develop into males. In the case of some fish, like Atlantic sil­
,·ersides, the adapth·e rationale for environmentally determined sex seems
clear-cut. Fry released into the cool waters at the outset of each breeding sea­
son are always female, while those born later, after the water has warmed, are
mostly male. In a world where big mothers will be more fecund ones, "his"
and "her" time-sharing of the birth season means daughters born early have
more time to grow big before they lay eggs. Biasing sex ratios in mammals is
more complicated, and less well understood.
    Skews in secondary sex ratios have been documented in mammals, but
deviations from so-so are rarely so pronounced as in fish or wasps-with
one notable exception, wood lemmings. These denizens of fir forests in
Northern Europe have the most skewed sex ratios of any mammal known.
Wood lemming mothers produce three to four times as many daughters as
sons. Their secret is a curious alteration on the sex chromosomes that causes
genes carried on theY chromosome to remain unexpressed. In humans and
other mammals, a female with just one X chromosome (denoted "XO")
would not be fertile, but for some reason, these "XY" lemmings exhibit
female phenotypes and are fertile.
    Just why such a capacity evolved is not known. Zoologist Nils Stenseth sug­
gests that manipulative lemming mothers have adapted to reproductive cycles
characterized by an inbreeding phase. Wood lemming sons in the past con­
fronted the same local competition for mates that wasp sons confront when
circumstances force them to breed with their sisters inside a fig. This very
"dominant" X chromosome allows XY sons to be transformed into daughters.
    Like other small arctic mammals, lemmings are prone to excesses, popu­
lation explosions followed by population busts. In bad years, the population
may crash. A pregnant female lucky enough to survive would find herself
alone in a lemmingless land, with no females for her sons to mate with. W hat
better tactic at that point than producing only as many sons as needed to fer­
tilize daughters-like Hamilton's fig wasps. Her grandchildren will move out

    Wood lemmings are the only mammals with chromosomal sex determi­
nation known to bias sex ratios to such hymenopteran extremes. But more
modest sex-ratio biases arc widely documented, including spontaneous abor­
tions that are sex selective-a surprise, perhaps, to anyone who assumes that
abortions are unnatural.

    Sex-Selective Abortion in Animals
Few funding agencies are interested in spending money to find out for sure if
other animals bias their sex ratios. Fewer still feel compelled to study spon­
taneous abortion of daughters in aquatic rodents. Fortunately, though, gov­
ernments are very interested in eliminating introduced pests. This is why
Britain's Ministry of Agriculture set up a massive program to trap coypu,
large ( 1 o-kg) guinea pig-like animals brought to Europe from South America
for fur breeding. When some of the coypu (also known as nutria) escaped,
they proved as footloose as they were furry and prolific, spreading like kudzu
weed across the marshlands of eastern England.
    The coypu trapped in this pest-control program provided the first oppor­
tunity to test sex-ratio theory in free-ranging mammals. Hired by the govern­
ment to eliminate his quarry, biologist Morris Gosling decided to inspect
their innards in the process. He dissected 5,853 coypu. Of these, 1,485 had
embryos old enough to count and to sex. Examining them, Gosling made the
first of several startling discoveries.
    Prior to fourteen weeks of pregnancy, a coypu uterus was as likely to con­
tain a mostly male as a mostly female litter. Later in gestation, however, it was
hard to find a mother pregnant with a small litter (of four embryos or less)
that was anything other than mostly male. The only plausible explanation was
that females carrying small, mostly female litters were spontaneously abort­
ing them. Surprisingly, the fattest females in best condition were the most
prone to do so. Were these abortions really reproductive failures, Gosling
wondered, or were they adaptive maternal management?
    EtTu, Coypu?
Late in her pregnancy, after week fourteen of her nineteen-week gestation, a
particularly fat coypu carrying the "wrong" type of litter for her circum­
stances spontaneously aborts. By this point, she would have laid down fat
stores needed to tide her through lactation. So what can a fat female at this
stage gain by bailing out so late? What she gains is the opportunity to do even
better reproductively in her next pregnancy. Instead of squandering a somatic
windfall on a handful of daughters, she aborts and quickly conceives again­
possibly conceiving a mostly male litter, or, failing that, at least a litter large
enough to take advantage of being in such fine fettle.
    "Abortion might he advantageous," Gosling reasoned, if "it allows the
female to transfer resources to a litter that is likely to achieve higher RS

[reproductiYe successJ." Females in good condition who find themselves
pregnant with small, mostly male litters, can count on producing especially
large-bodied, competitiYe sons. But fat females pregnant with mostly daugh­
ters reap no special reward. Pregnant coypu are somehow assessing their own
condition, and aborting or continuing with pregnancies accordingly. 37
    It was an astonishing observation, but not totally unforeseen. Just over a
decade earlier, in 1973, two graduate students, biologist RobertTrivers and
mathematician Dan Willard, had published a paper in Science predicting
Gosling's result.
    Custom-Made Families
T he Triyers- Willard hypothesis states that wherever variation in reproductive
success is greater for one sex than for the other, and where the reproductive
success of individuals of that sex depends on maternal effects, then mothers
in good condition should favor the sex with the greatest variance in repro­
ducth·e success. Mothers in poor condition should favor the sex with the
least. Under most circumstances, the sex with the greatest variance in repro­
ductive success, and the one that benefits most from maternal advantages, is
sons. T his is why in a species like coypu, mothers in good condition should
theoretically prefer sons (or else a very large litter), while those in poor con­
dition should prefer daughters. Just how mothers might do this is a mystery.
Some have speculated that sex ratios are biased prior to conception by differ­
ent hormonal conditions in the mother and differential survival of X- and
Y-bearing sperm inside the mother en route to the egg, or else through dif­
ferential survival of male and female embryos. 38
    In devising the theory, Trivers and Willard actually had large mammals,
like deer or caribou, in mind. A male deer whose mother was healthy and
well fed v\'Ould grow into a particularly large and competitive stag, able to
out-compete and exclude rivals born to mothers in poor condition. The
mother of a noncompetitive son would be better off producing a daughter:
eYen a hind in poor condition should be able to conceive and pull through at
least some offspring.
    Today, the logic of Trivcrs-Willard has been found to predict sex ratios at
birth among animals ranging from the noble red deer of Scotland to pudgy
possums ambling about on the forest floor of Central America, not to men­
tion footloose coypu everywhere.The hypothesis even explains the ncar com­
plete specialization in daughters by low-ranking spider monkey mothers in

Peruvian rain forests. It applies when the main determinant of reproductive
success is access to females. 39
    But what happens when the critical factor is not access to mates but
resources? What if offspring of one sex are better than the other at protecting
a territory, or converting its resources into reproductive success? What if
offspring of one sex do more than the other sex to enhance or protect the
value of local resources at the parents' disposal-known as "local resource
enhancement"?40
    Today the classic demonstration of biased production of daughters or sons
depending on which sex most enhances the value of parental resources
derives from a remarkable study of a rare species of bird known as the Sey­
chelles warbler.
    T he Seychelles are a motley group of islands in the western Indian ocean,
some rocky and waterless, others lushly tropical. These islands provide the
natural "laboratory" that permitted Dutch ornithologist Jan Komdeur to
prove conclusively that bird parents adjust sex ratios, producing offspring of
the sex most likely to enhance the family's situation, depending on the cir­
cumstances prevailing when they hatch. These birds clinch the case that ani­
mals can custom-tailor their families.41
     Up until 1988, the entire world population of Seychelles warblers was
confined to a single island. Three hundred and twenty perky, white-chested
little birds the color of cinnamon toast had saturated locally available habitats
on that island. Breeding pairs were spread out in territories , where they
remained for up to nine years, producing a clutch once a year, usually just one
egg per clutch. Although warblers can breed in their first year, daughters
remained where they were born , helping parents catch insects to feed
             DAUGHTERS          OR SONS?       IT   ALL   DEPENDS             333
younger siblings. W hen this allomother was removed, reproductive success
of the parents went down. But there is a catch.
    If insects arc scarce, ha\'ing helpers around who compete with their par­
ents for sustenance is more a liability than an asset. In line with this calculus ,
parents on poor territories who do not benefit from having helpers produce
mostly sons (who arc not inclined to stick around). Noticing this, the
researchers decided to experiment. Parents were transplanted to new terri­
tories under controlled conditions.
    Warbler pairs placed on food-rich, wide-open territories could presum­
ably afford "au pairs." As predicted, 87 percent of these privileged parents
produced daughters, the sex most inclined to stay and help out. Of parents
placed on poor territories, only 23 percent had daughters fledge. How? Not
known. One possibility might he that the birds use some sort of "starting
rule"-incubating eggs of the "right sex" hut abandoning nests containing the
wrong sex and starting over. This much is certain: Seychelles warblers are
adapti\"ely configuring offspring sets in response to family history and local
conditions just as surely as some human parents are. It is unlikely, however,
that the mechanisms in humans are the same. Rather, there appears to have
been selection on the human psyche for general decision rules that produce
outcomes similar to those physiologically produced in other animals. Far
from locking parents into some preordained response, however, a biological
basis for these preferences should make parental attitudes toward sons versus
daughters imminently changeable. By now, this claim will seem curious only
to readers who still assume that evolved traits are necessarily immutable­
which they are not.
    When the "Rules" Themselves Are Contingent ...
The perennial question "which sex to produce" can be mind-boggling, espe­
cially in such flexible primates as baboons and macaques, "weedy" species like
humans are, readily adapting to diverse habitats. As in all the well-studied
Old World cercopithccine monkeys, baboon and macaque daughters inherit
rank from their mothers. Because daughters remain nearby, it behooves a
high-ranking m other to produce the sex that will benefit most from her own
status, as well as bolster matrilineal interests by supporting kin (another form
of local resource enhancement). In habitats like Amboseli, where food is
scarce, high-ranking mothers do just this-they overproduce daughters. The
same pattern can also be documented for some populations of macaques.
334                 MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
    Year after year, mothers in the highest-ranking matrilines consistently
produce significantly more daughters than sons, while low-ranking females
produce few daughters and more sons. Low-ranking females not only pro­
duce few daughters, but such daughters as they do produce are more likely to
die than are sons born to mothers of equivalently low rank . Based on captive
studies of bonnet macaques, Joan Silk showed that whereas sons who depart
their natal group can leave the disadvantages of their mother's low rank
behind, daughters cannot. In her study, no daughter born to a low-ranking
mother managed to produce a single surviving offspring. W hen competition
for local resources is intense, a daughter born to a high-status mother is the
right sex in the right place at that time. +2
    Recall that among the baboons Jeanne Altmann studied at Amboseli,
infants have a 25-perccnt chance of dying during each of the first two years of
life. But if that baby is a daughter born to a high-ranking mother-the "right
scx"-the baby's survival chances go up twofold, and are higher than survival
chances for a son born to a mother of the same status. Such daughters also
breed sooner. On average, mothers who get the sex right contribute an extra
half-grand-offspring to the next generation. Mothers at Amboseli produce no
more than seven offspring in their lives, of which on average only two sur­
vive. Given how little these baboon mothers have to show for a lifetime spent
producing and carrying babies , such bonuses add up.
    Generation after generation, cumulative reproductive advantages mean
that mothers in these matrilineal systems compete for more enduring stakes
than the isolated copulations males fight over. A male who hitches his repro­
ductive star to a successful matriline by siring a daughter in one, secures his
ticket to posterity. Similarly, if a male's mate is a subordinate female, both
parents benefit from son production. Lowborn sons, like poor country boys,
strike out for distant opportunities, leaving natal disadvantages behind. But in
some cercopithecine monkeys like macaques, there is another reason for sub­
ordinate mothers to bias toward sons. Females from dominant matrilines
maliciously harass daughters born to competing mothers, sending a not so
subtle message: "We may tolerate your sons for a time, but your daughters-­
who will be permanent residents-arc not welcome." These bullies inflict
much wear and tear on low-ranking mothers, especially those carrying
daughters. Silk hypothesized that such penalties imposed upon low-ranking
mothers who produce daughters has led to selection on suhonlinate mothers
to either avoid conceiving, or avoid gestating, daughte1·s. 41

    Yet e\·en this sophisticated calculus is not the whole story. When environ­
mental conditions change, the mother macaque or baboon pulls out a new
rule book .
    . . . and the "Wrong" Sex Shall Become the "Right" One
Year after year the evidence grows stronger that in habitats like Amboseli,
daughters arc a liability to low-ranking mother·s. Sons offer the best pros­
pects. Yet researchers elsewhere document different patterns. In some
baboon and macaque populations, no effect of maternal rank on sex ratios is
found at all. Others exhibit the mirror-image of the Amboseli pattern, with
high-ranking mothers overproducing sons, low-ranking ones daughters, just
asTrivers and Willard predicted.44
    Different teams of researchers were reporting different patterns, each
group suspecting the others must be getting it wrong. Those who found no
statistically significant differences assumed that the other two groups were
infected by "sex-ratio fever" and in their theoretical delirium were imagining
patterns in what was only random variation.
    In  1 99 1, Carel van Schaik and I were among the primatologists swept
up in what we jokingly referred to as the "wild, wild world of sex-ratio
research." What if, we wondered, the researchers weren't wrong. What if the
monkeys were changing the rules? We noticed, for example, that it was the
macaque and baboon populations from wide-open habitats with plenty of
food and room for expansion that were least likely to conform to the
"Amboseli pattern." Outright reversals of that pattern (with high-ranking
mothers overproducing sons, low-ranking ones daughters) were most often
reported in large outdoor breeding colonies where the combination of ample
food and space contributed to very high birth rates. (Producing babies, after
all, is what breeding colonies are for.) This is when it occurred to us that
under ecological conditions conducive to rapid population growth, the dif­
ferences in male and female reproductive potential so critical to the logic of
the Trivers-Willard hypothesis become relevant. At this point, a mother's
determination of the optimal sex of offspring for her circumstances does a
flip-flop.
    We reasoned that in rapidly expanding populations, where both high- and
low-ranking females can successfully breed, the greater reproductive poten­
tial of sons born to mothers in good condition takes priority over the endur­
ing value of advantageous maternal rank. Under the arduous conditions at
                    MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
Amboseli, matrilineal access to scarce resources is the mother's top priority.
But in high-growth populations, monkey mothers march to a different drum­
mer, depending on whether the most important factor limiting the breeding
success of their offspring will be access to resources or access to mates.
    What Keeps Human Sex Ratios Nearly Equal?
The existence in animals, especially other primates, of heretofore undreamed­
of capacities to adjust their production of sons versus daughters in adaptive
way s raises an awkward question. Given long-standing biases in favor of a
particular sex, why hasn't natural selection led to subsets of human mothers
who adjust to variable local conditions by automatically producing the
desired sex? The existing sy stem is not only cruel (which is not relevant to
Mother Nature), it is wasteful (which is).
    If it is possible for selection to act on mothers to bias sex ratios at birth,
why stop with a paltry six extra sons per hundred daughters? In populations
where from time immemorial parents have discriminated against daughters,
why don't we see sex ratios at birth in the vicinity of 2oo: 1 oo? This would
save parents much wasted effort: all the energy, the opportunity costs, the
time and risk of a pregnancy to produce a baby her parents won't even keep.
Why, then, are human sex ratios at birth so nearly equal, roughly 51 percent
male, 49 percent female?
    When biologists are asked why sex ratios consistently hover conserva­
tively close to parity, more likely than not they will invoke "Fisher's principle
of the sex ratio." This time-honored axiom of population genetics explains
why roughly equal numbers of the two sexes are produced among so many
species of birds and mammals. In the 1930s, British biostatistician Sir Ronald
Fisher reasoned that so long as producing sons costs the same as producing
daughters; and so long as outbreeding prevails (that is, brothers don't breed
with sisters, as fig wasps do); and so long as all individuals have roughly the
same opportunity to breed (a big if, as it turns out); then parents should allo­
cate equal investment in sons and daughters.
    Imagine a population in which certain parents specialize in one or the
other sex. Let's say most mothers produced sons. As offspring mature, they
will breed in a lopsided world, top-heavy with males. Too bad for the sex in
excess. Although every scarce female will get to breed, only a random subset
of males will manage to. Too bad also for the parents that overproduced sons,
            D A ll G H T E R S 0 R   S 0 N S ? I T A L L D E I' E N D S    337
because, on average, son-producers will be penalized by having fewer grand­
children. The mother lucky enough to produce daughters, on the other hand ,
will be rewarded by disproportionately more grandchildren-at least tem­
porarily.
    0\·er time, natural selection should favor parents that produce the rare
sex, with the predictable outcome-a glut of daughters. Once again, the
sex ratio should gravitate back to favor son-producers. And so it goes,
the pendulum swinging fi1·st one direction, then the other, favoring first
daughter-producers, then son-specialists. The outcome, according to Fisher,
is a population with more or less equal numbers of sons and daughters. 45
    Fisher's principle is the conventional explanation for why wildly skewed
sex ratios evoke only under special conditions. But such special conditions
turn out to be not so unusual. Supposedly, Fisher's principle explains why
most human sex ratios are only as mildly skewed as they are. The reasons
slightly more sons are born on average is that males are more vulnerable
(both in utero and in infancy) to dying before the end of parental investment;
thus, by producing slightly more of them, parents are merely equalizing
investment in sons and daughters.
    Yet other animals-baboons and macaques, for example-deviate from
Fisherian equality when one or the other sex costs less or provides a bigger
reproductive payoff. Why don't humans?
    It is possible, of course, that the phenomenon occurs but has somehow
gone undetected. For example, if parents biasing toward sons were lumped
with those biasing toward daughters, the average sex ratio would come out
so-so. Indeed, deviations from the expected, approximately equal, human
sex ratios at birth are sometimes noted.46 Occasionally groups surface with
spectacularly high sex ratios that cannot be attributed to differential neglect
or infanticide. These may (or may not) have to do with customs that affect the
timing of conception. 47 Furthermore, every so often geneticists stumble on a
rare pedigree, such as the English family that for ten generations produced
daughters in 32 of 35 births, or the French family that produced exclusively
daughters (72 of them) over three generations. Yet these could be explained
as chance occurrences.
    Massive screening has unearthed only a handful of deviant cases, and none
so extreme, nor so precisely calibrated to reproductive possibilities, as the
wildly biased sex ratios readily located among wasps, wood lemmings, war-
                    MOTHERS          AND    ALLOMOTHERS
biers, and spider monkeys. Overall, deviations from the standard human sex
ratio of 1 o2 to 1 o6 boys per 1 oo girls are rare, prompting a puzzled commen­
tary from George Williams, who wrote in a now famous passage:
    I find it rather mysterious that adaptive control of progeny seems not
    to have evolved. [That this matter is left to chance) seems to contradict
    evolutionary theory. . . . Instead, deviations from random sex deter­
    mination are trivial at best. 48
    There could be an error in sampling, or else the theory could be wrong.
Or human sex ratios might be adaptive all right, but parents postpone their
adjustments in parental investment until after birth-as many Asian families
have long done. Much evidence points to this third possibility. Humans con­
front the same posterity problems other animals do, but resolve them differ­
ently. Instead of innate mechanisms that bias production of sons or daughters
at conception (as in wasps), or differential retention of mostly female litters
(as in the coypu), human mothers consciously choose sons and daughters cifter
birth, in line with parental evaluation of what the repercussions will be for
long-term family goals. The underlying psychology-although not the out­
comes-are probably similar when modern American parents make choices
about how much money to spend on toys for their children, or certain med­
ications, like growth hormones.
    Each year in the United States, parents spend 6o percent more on toys for
boys (Legos and G.l. Joes) than on toys for girls (disproportionately dolls) .
Parents are twice as likely to treat a growth hormone inadequacy in a son as
in a daughter. Part of their calculation is surely not just whether they wish to
invest more in sons than daughters, but which sex they feel will benefit more
from the intervention. Height, to take one example, is a far more important
predictor of success (including salaries and marriage options) for sons than it
is for daughters. 49
    Reassessing the Rajput Case
No research on biased sex ratios in birds or mammals had been done when
anthropologist Mildred Dickemann first encountered the logic laid out by
Trivers and Willard in their 1973 paper. Social scientists at that time paid
scant attention to the idea that there might be innate human predispositions
that enhanced inclusive fitness and the long-term survival of family lines.
            DAUGHTERS         OR SONS?       IT   ALL DEPENDS                339
Devaluation of daughters was viewed as a purely cultural construct. It was
assumed to he the outcome of free-floating minds spinning infinitely variable
webs of meaning out of locally received traditions. 50
    As far as cultural anthropologists were concerned, the ideology of son
preference along with the custom of paying dowries to marry off daughters
sutliced to explain female infanticide. What other reasons could there be?Yet
Dickemann was struck by how well the patterning of son preference in the
north Indian case conformed to predictions of an evolutionary model that
applied to animals generally.
    Trivers and Willard proposed that parents in good condition should prefer
sons, those that were disadvantaged, daughters. They even specified that this
logic would be found in socially stratified human societies, where women
marry up the social scale, whenever the "reproductive success of a male at the
upper end of the scale exceeds his sister's, while that of a female at the lower
end of the scale exceeds her brother's. A tendency for the female to marry a
male whose socioeconomic status is higher than hers will, other things being
equal, tend to bring about such a correlation." Trivers and Willard's logic
e,·en explained the most puzzling feature of daughter slaying in the Rajput
case-why the most elite families were the most likely to kill half of their off­
spring. By contrast, sub-elites were left paying exorbitant dowries to place
daughters in one of these elite households, impoverishing their sons in the
process. The poorest subcastes, who really did not have enough resources to
feed their children, were the ones who welcomed daughters and did not kill
them. 51 None of this made sense unless one accepted the assumption that
parents were not counting offspring but looking further down the line,
toward grandchildren and beyond, toward the sur vival of a family line.
    Reversals of Fortune Leaving Daughters Preferred
Eliminating daughters at the top of the hierarchy produces a vacuum sucking
up marriageable girls from below, and creating a shortage at the bottom.
Families don't pay dowries to place daughters in families with the same or
lower status than their own. They demand payment for them instead. At the
bottom of the heap, sons whose families cannot cough up the required bride­
price remain celibate. Far from calamities, daughters are the most valuable
commodity low-status families possess. 52
    Referring to a daughter as a commodity will strike many as extraordi­
narily callous. But we are not talking about postindustrial Western popula-
                   MOTHERS       AND     ALLOMOTHERS
tions that for generations have lived in an unprecedented state of ecological
release, freed from concern about famines. Continued survival of such par­
ents and their children rarely depends on choices mothers make about how
much food to allocate to one child versus another. But not all mothers are so
fortunate. Daughters not only offered the only prospect for upward mobility,
in many cases they provided the only possibility at all of continued survival of
a family line.
    In parts of the world where drought and famine are recurring hazards, the
landless and dispossessed invariably have the worst chance of making it
through. Under such harsh circumstances the likeliest survivors will be off­
spring of mothers who marry into families with access to resources, like
arable land. 53 Hypergamy (girls marrying up) is not a fluke. It was a long­
standing necessity for lineage sur vival. Nor can it be denied that decisions
leading to it have genetic outcomes.
    Centuries of hypergamous mating have left a trail of genetic markers, like
breadcrumbs through the forest of the Indian caste system, documenting the
different paths followed by the two sexes as they married and produced off­
spring. An examination of genetic traits carried in mitochondrial DNA (DNA
found in somatic and egg cells but not in sperm), which is transmitted only
from mother to offspring, showed that these mother-transmitted traits are
spread widely beyond traditional caste boundaries. For centuries, they have
been carried by brides and concubines moving up in the world by marrying
into higher-caste families. By contrast, paternally transmitted markers, traits
passed from father to son on theY chromosome, are less mobile. Father­
transmitted traits remain localized, rarely spreading beyond the caste where
they originated. 54 This may be one reason why male traits are more vulnera­
ble to extinction than those carried by mothers. Thus do customs previously
viewed as purely cultural have profound demographic and genetic conse­
quences, as well as deep roots in human motivations and their decision rules
regarding children.
    Human Nature and Human History
The earliest evidence for sex-biased infanticide derives from the DNA of
baby skeletons-all less than two days old and without apparent defect­
excavated from the sewer of an ancient brothel in Roman Ashkclon on the
southern coast of modern Israel. Four teen of the nineteen victims of what

archaeologists suspected was infanticide were male. If their mothers were
indeed prostitutes, one assumes they came from the lowest rank of society:
daughters but not sons of these women would have value. A preference for
sons among elites mirrored by a preference for daughters among the dispos­
sessed is a pattern that still persists. Daughter preference can still be docu­
mented today among Hungarian Gypsies and other disadvantaged groups.
Consider what happened with the late          198os fall of communism. Across
eastern Europe, economics and social ser vices were disrupted, leading to an
increase in both misery and unwanted pregnancies. Not surprisingly, the inci­
dence of neonaticide has increased, hut with an unusual twist. Prior to 1990,
sons and daughters were about equally likely to be killed. After 1990, Slova­
kian researcher Peter Sykora documents that the victims arc disproportion­
ately male-21 of 27 in the neonaticides in his sample. 55
    Large chunks ofWestern history can be understood only by paying atten­
tion to such patterns. Human fates can be read as artifacts of differential
treatment of offspring by their parents. Which sons inherited land and con­
tinued dynasties, which departed instead to colonize new worlds. Which
offspring were predestined to live out their lives in monasteries (or in con­
vents), which daughters were dowered and sent off to distant kingdoms.
Nowhere is this point better made than in the writing of the archaeologist
and social historian James Boone.
    Using medieval Portuguese genealogies, Boone traced the fates of sons
and daughters among both the elites-royalty and landed gentry-and those
who served them, bureaucrats and soldiers, over a two-hundred-year period
(from 1380 to I5"8o). Dukes and counts at the highest social ranks left more
sun-iving legitimate offspring (4. 7 offspring on average, with no reliable
counts for illegitimates) than did cavaleiros and military men below them
(2. 3 legitimate children on average). For both sexes, firstborn offspring fared
better. Later-born sons fought in the Crusades farther from home, stayed
away longer, and were more likely to die in far-off places like India than first­
born sons, who often went no farther than Morocco and soon returned to
marry and take over family holdings.
    Redundant daughters were similarly banished, not to distant lands, but to
convents. Italian novelist Alessandro Manzoni provided an apt description of
this predestined claustration in his description of the proud Milanese patri­
arch who "destined all the younger children of either sex to the cloister, so as
                   MOTHERS          AND     ALLOMOTHERS
to leave the family fortune intact for the eldest son, whose function it was to
perpetuate the family." This practice brought great unhappiness to younger
offspring of both sexes.
    In his 1827 epic I promessi sposi (The Betrothed), Manzoni sums up the
plight of a later-born daughter:
    Still hidden in her mother's womb ... her state in life had already
    been irrevocably settled. All that remained to be decided was whether
    it was to be that of a monk or a nun, a decision for which her presence
    but not her consent was required.56
    Among Boone's medieval Portuguese, between 1 o and 40 percent of
daughters at any given time were cloistered in convents.Elite daughters who
married produced an average of 3. 7 children, about the same as the number
(3.3) of surviving children left by sub-elite women, many of whom had
moved up the social scale when they married. Overall, the reproductive suc­
cess of daughters born to lower-ranking families was higher than that of their
brothers, while at the top of the hierarchy-as among the north Indian
Rajputs-the reverse was true. When Boone fed these data into his computer
to simulate how this situation would play out through time, elites produced
significantly more grandchildren in the third generation through sons than
daughters, while lower ranks did better with daughters than sons. 57
    Among "The Despised Ones"
It was reversals of fortune such as these that attracted the notice of anthro­
pologist Lee Cronk when he went to Kenya to study the Mukogodo. Cronk's
study is unusual, because he specifically focused on those on the lowest rungs
of the local ladder.
    The Mukogodo are former foragers pressured by economic necessity to
attach themselves as a disadvantaged "subcastc" to Masai pastoralists, adopt­
ing Masai language and values but never achieving equal status. Locally, the
name M uk ogo<Io means "t he < I esp1sc<
                                      ·  I ones " or, more l"t

    As is typical among pastoralists, the Masai prefer sons.The Mukogodo,
who emulate them, claim to as well.But the actual behavior of Mukogodo
mothers and the sex ratio of their offspring (there are about 6 7 little boys for
every 1 oo girls) tell a different story.Mukogodo mothers hrcast-fccd daugh­
ters longer than sons, and arc more inclined to pay to take a sick daughter

than a sick son to the medical clinic. Partly for this reason, daughters arc
healthier and more likely to survh·e than sons.
     Out of this strange union of two cultm·es has emerged a hypergamous
marriage sysh'm structun.'d along the lines Dickemann identified in the
1·igidly stratified clans of precolonial Rajasthan: women How up the hierarchy,
with daughters preferred oYer sons at the bottom. Because so many Muko­
godo women become primary or secondary wives to Masai up the social
scale, many Mukogodo men, with smaller herds of livestock to draw on for
bride-price, have difficulty obtaining wives at all. With so many Mukogodo
sons growing old wifeless, their average completed fertility is below that of
the aYcrage Mukogo<lo daughter. 58 It is not possible to know for sure which
mothers value more, the material benefits daughters bring, counted in live­
stock, or the grandchildren; but my guess is that over evolutionary time the
two were so intertwined as to make them inseparable so far as a mother's
internalized preferences for different offspring arc concerned.
    Economics of Daughter Preference
Outright daughter preference is unusual, but not necessarily confined to
the disadnntaged. Among the matrilineallonga people of southern Zaire,
daughters are essential for perpetuating the basimukoa, or matrilineage. The
more prosperous the matrilineage, the more pressure to bear daughters. Not
surprisingly, there are two cries of joy at the birth of a baby girl, only one for a
boy. Too many sons, and the mother comes in for criticism from kin. More to
the point, males die in childhood at far higher rates than females. Of recorded
births, only 9 2 boys arc reported for every 1 oo girls. When twins of mixed
sexes are born, the boy is neglected, and more likely to die. Same-sex male
twins die at fiye times the rate of singletons, suggesting that parents do not go
out of their way to keep them alive. 59
     Sometimes parents, e\·en those living in areas with a long tradition of son
preference, come to prefer daughters because women have found a special
economic niche for themseh·es. This is the case with daughters born on the
island of Cheju Do, off the coast of South Korea. Cheju Do is renowned for
its women abalone diYers, called haeyno. Because this occupation is relatively
well paid, daughters provide more security than sons. When a woman on
Cheju Do learns she is pregnant, she prays for a girl. 6° Financial indepen­
dence of these women has also led to the highest divorce rate in Korea. In this
respect, Cheju Do has come to resemble some Western countries where fam-
344                 MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
ilies arc in transition between long-standing patriarchal traditions and brave
new worlds where legal protections along with economic opportunities for
women mean they can afford to survive and rear a family with or without a
male provider.
    Fine-Tuning Family Configurations
Parents can be remarkably specific in their requirements for certain offspring
sets. There are time-honored traditions specifying which sex stays or inherits,
which leaves empty-handed or marries out with a dowry instead, which child
lingers on as a celibate spinster baby-sitting for the designated heir.
    In many areas ofAsia, the ideal family is composed of two to four sons and
one or two daughters. Thus, it should not surprise us to occasionally
encounter "missing boys" along with all the missing girls-albeit not in such
vast numbers. Anthropologist G. William Skinner was among the first to pre­
dict and document just such a pattern to missing children. In his most recent
study of census data from China's lower Yangtze region, Skinner and co­
worker Yuan Jianhua documented 1 2 million missing girls, mostly higher­
                                       •
birth-order daughters, but also some 6o,ooo missing boys, mostly from
families that already had several sons.
    Culturally mediated parental preferences can play out with chilling pre­
dictability. Studies of child survival among villagers in the Punjab and in
Bangladesh make it clear that it is not just daughters in these families that are
at risk, but daughters with one or more older sisters. In one village in
Bangladesh, such daughters have a 9o-percent higher chance of dying before
the end of childhood than do girls without any older sister.A boy with the bad
luck of being born after two or more older brothers has a 4o-percent greater
                                         61
chance of dying than an only son does.
Parental commitment to offspring can depend on how nearly the child's sex
and birth order conform to a desired norm. Among the first to empirically
demonstrate this was sociobiologist Paul Turke, in fieldwork among Pacific
islanders on lfalukAtoll. Daughters among these fishcrfolk arc more produc­
tive than sons. They also help parents to rear younger siblings more than sons
do. No wonder daughters arc preferred. Parents who achieve the ideal con­
figuration, producing a daughter first and then a son, were better off and

higher lifetime reproductive success than women who bore a son first.
    In patriarchal societies in satUJ·ated habitats, such mild preference for
an initial daughter may he taken to extremes. Among eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century fanners on the Nohi plain of Japan, the ideal pattern of
"first a girl then a hoy" has a name: ichihimc nitaro. Sons a1·e the preferred sex,
but if they can, parents arrange things so as to have a little allomother on hand
to help rear the primary heir, to make sure he is as healthy an<) good as he can
he.63 Parents were not above loading the demographic dice in an astounding
gamble. Those young enough to be confident of plenty more chances to try
for a "jackpot" configuration might eliminate even the much desired son if he
happened to he horn first, thus enhancing the odds of achieving the ideal ichi­
himc nitaro. Thereafter, parents in Tokugawa japan used infanticide to space
births and-if conditions were sufficiently auspicious-to achieve as nearly
as possible an ideal configuration of well-spaced, gender-balanced offspring
with a fully qualified firstborn son coming of age just as his father was ready

board preference for male children, solvable by an across-the-board biasing
of the sex ratio.
    Why Humans Bias Investment After Birth
Humans, like other animals, use flexible "decision rules" to bias investment
toward daughters under some conditions, toward sons under others. But
unlike a mother wasp, who sizes up demographic prospects and then com­
mits herself to producing mostly daughters or mostly sons, humans with very
few exceptions leave the matter open until after birth. Then they evaluate
contingencies like birth order, offspring quality, available assistance, even
inheritance prospects. Given the importance of history and how extraordi­
narily flexible human breeding systems are, and how variable the environ­
ments in which they live can be, parents with innate propensities to produce
one or the other sex would have been wrong as often as they were right.65
    Where environmental conditions, marriage and residence patterns, or
laws can change on short notice, the better part of evolutionary valor is to
postpone irrevocable decisions till the last feasible moment. Conscious
strategists constantly update information about local prospects for sons ver­
sus daughters. Chronic tensions between maternal and patrilineal interests
                  MOTHERS          AND     ALLOMOTHERS
are resolved quite differently as new subsistence opportunities open up while
others close, as daughters once of no use suddenly become net assets, and so
on. Unlike other creatures with pressing reasons to bias parental investment
prior to birth, the sheer variability of the human condition makes that degree
of precommitment ill-advised. Furthermore, unlike other mammals, the
sheer duration of parental investment in the human case, and the myriad
forms it can take-food, educational costs, marriage payments, inheri­
tances-means that parents have many ways and myriad opportunities to bias
investment in different offspring.
    Imagine a mother in unusually good condition who somehow biased pro­
duction toward a daughter in preparation for a nice matrilocal life, and then
found herself captured by some warlike, patriarchal tribe where only sons
were valued. Her physiologically based "decision" would have been a mistake.
Far better to pursue the Fisherian course of equal investment prior to birth,
and then fine-tune investment in sons and daughters after birth, responding
to local cues and customs.
    Biologically Based Behaviors Are Changeable
Faced with constraints, parents readily value some offspring over others. This
is the bad news. The good news is that nowhere in the human psyche are spe­
cific sex preferences-such as a mania for sons-engraved in DNA. As wide­
spread as son preference happens to be, there is nothing to indicate that it
represents an innate or universal preference on the part of mothers or
fathers. There is no all-purpose psychoemotional straitjacket where daugh­
ters and sons are concerned. In societies with strong patriarchal traditions,
however, it may take special circumstances for daughters to become as desir­
able as sons-especially if parents expect to have only one child.
    Sex of offspring has been a long-standing concern for Westerners, too.
Even those who claim they "don't have a preference" find that they do when
pressed to imagine a situation in which they will have only one child. Instead
of infanticide, however, Western parents have adjusted parental investment
through time hy designating some sons for the church, some later-born
daughters to become "spinster aunts" (the fate George Eliot's family had in
mind for her). In the United States, it has been only in the last century or so
that married women had. rights to own property in their own name, and only
since the Married Women's Property Acts passed in England and the United
States in the latter part of the nineteenth century that daughters began to

Fig. 13 ·4 Traditionally daughters from poor and low-status families in northern India--like this
woman road worker-were buffered from discrimination both by the "bride-price" they com­
manded at marriage and by the wages they were able to earn. In north India today, however, men

daughters is creeping down the social scale, erasing much of the protection daughters of the dis­

inherit on an equal footing with their brothers. Protected by law, daughters
today are actually somewhat more likely than sons to finish college, and are
beginning to have athletic and career opportunities equivalent to those long
open to sons. For many one-child couples, daughters arc actually the sex of
choice. But these are very recent transformations, still virtually experi­
ments-fragile ones at that-following as they do on the heels of long-stand­
ing biases favoring sons.

Western folklore about sex determination could fill volumes. The Greek
philosopher Anaxagoras believed that the left and the right testes differed, so
that by tying off the weaker (left one) a man increased the odds of a son. Aris­
totle recommended facing north during sexual intercourse, because he
believed a cold southern wind would induce conception of daughters . For the
more literal-minded, homespun recommendations for siring sons prescribed
wearing boots to bed.
    Not all of this is ancient history. Eschewing such folklore, New Yorkers in
the 196os turned to Dr. Landrum Shettles, who prescribed a regimen of
vinegar douches to privilege X-bearing sperm, a douche of baking powder to
promote the fortunes of Y-bearers. Shettles was followed in the 198os by his
West Coast counterpart, physiologist Ronald Ericsson, founder of Gametrics
Ltd . of Sausalito, California. Ericsson promised parents sex selection using a
special technique to separate faster Y-hearing sperm from the more sluggish
X-bearing ones. He advertised his central premise with vanity license plates

on his car that read "X or Y." There was even a brief period when North
Americans could go to a drugstore and pick up a "Gender choice child selec­
tion kit" for $49.95, complete with thermometer and paraphernalia for mon­
itoring vaginal mucus, to determine precisely the moment for conceiving a
son or daughter. W hen the U.S. Food and Drug Administration decided that
claims implied by pink and blue advertising on the box were not substanti­
ated, the kits were pulled off store shelves. Today, prenatal sex testing is
widely available in the West. Anyone determined to usc it for sex selection
can manage to do so without breaking any laws.
This chapter began with sex-selective infanticide in China. I am not immune
to the distress this stark topic generates. All the more reason for dispassionate
analysis. For humans arc, above all, resourceful creatures. They do not readily
abandon self-interest for the common good, or for someone else's good.
Humans do not easily, and without good cause, abandon the nepotistic urges
that brought us from a paltry ten thousand souls a few hundred thousand
years ago to the six billion on Earth today. Philosophizing about topics like
whether humans have free will (and if so, how to employ it) is far removed
from the daily concerns of most humans.
    It is the common humanity of the parents that is at stake here, not ethnic
or cultural differences. Those who would rush to Beijing to deliver passionate
diatribes would do well to maintain some historical perspective. W hile Chi­
nese infanticide rates have declined dramatically since the nineteenth cen­
tury, during that same period rates of child abuse, neglect, and infanticide
have skyrocketed in countries like the United States, although sex of the off­
spring has relatively little to do with it.66
    Infanticide in China is already illegal. Since 1 9 8 7, laws against disclosing
the sex of a fetus to parents who might subsequently practice sex-selective
abortion make Chinese laws related to sex-selective abortion tougher than
such la,vs in the West. It is hard to see, therefore, what sense there would
be to additional legislation making preferential female infanticide or sex­
selective abortion more illegal in China than it already is. Incentives arc liable
to be more effective than prohibitions. The most effective remedy may be
widely available contraception for birth spacing combined with educational
                 MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
and employment opportunities that create attractive futures for daughters,
including scholarships and job oppor tunities that will benefit their families.
Countries convinced that mandatory birth control is essential for the long­
term welfare of their people might want to consider special vouchers for
daughters-only families-good for extra grandchildren.

           hroughout human history, and long before, mothers have been mak­
          ing tradcoffs between quality and quantity, managing reproductive
           effort in line with their own life stage, condition, and current
circumstances. As a result, infancy has not always been the warm, safe-in-the­
arms-of-love tableau many of us imagine. It was, instead, a perilous bottle­
neck that each individual contributor to the human gene pool had to pass
through. Historical records provide ample documentation as to how tight a
squeeze that sometimes was.

dence of maternal indifference on a massive scale and today arc often held up
as the prime exhibit in the case against the existence of maternal instincts in
the human species. But I don't think that's what they actually prove.
    These much-cited numbers derive from Lieutenant-General Charles­
Pierre LeNoir, a police official whose job it was to monitor the referral
bureaus used by working parents to locate wet nurses. LeNoir was also
responsible for investigating complaints about wet nurses who failed to live
up to the terms of their contracts, as well as registering the disappearance of
infants lost in the shuffle.
     Of the 2o,ooo babies nursed by women other than their mothers, the
luckiest 2� percent were born to propertied parents who placed their chil­
dren directly with wet nurses. Often such elites would rely on rural tenants
or other contacts to find acce ptable candidates. Some of the wet nurses, nan-
                                                 H•

nies hired to lactate as well as caretake, would live with the family under
maternal super vision. The unluckiest 2) percent of babies were delegated to
foundling homes as described in chapter 1 2. It was up to these institutions to
locate someone to feed them, if they could.
    The remaining wet-nursed babies were mostly born to the middle class­
artisans, shopkeepers, or traders. These were the "Bourgeoisie de Paris," but
often only barely. Within this social class, a mother's salary or her unpaid
labor was critical for the family's economic well-being. 2Typically, such moth­
ers were neither unmarried nor destitute. They relied on professional inter­
mediaries to find wet nurses for their babies. Hence the edge to the feminist
query raised by philosopher Elisabeth Badinter in Mother Love: Myth and Real­
ity. If such a thing as maternal instinct exists, how could so many thousands of
mothers be so unfeeling as to ship their newborns off to be suckled by an
unknown woman?
     "Discretionary" Distancing
Twentieth-century debates over the existence of maternal instinct focused on
such "discretionary" delegation of care. It was not the desperate mothers,
who arguably had no choice, that attracted notice, but the bourgeois mothers
who presumably could afford to keep their babies near them-and yet did
not. Greuze's painting of the farewell kiss (figure 14.1) shows what went on
outside the house. In large French cities, a middleman, called a meneur, would
pick up the newborn. What happened inside the home, or inside people's
heads, was less clear. An account by an eighteenth-century Frenchwoman-a
disciple of Rousseau-offers a glimpse. The writer, Jeanne-Marie Phlipon de
Roland, has just visited an acquaintance who, though hopeful of a male heir,
had given birth to another daughter. "Mme. D'Eu gave birth yesterday at
noon to a girl," Madame Roland wrote.
     Her husband is completely ashamed of it; she is in a foul mood over
    it. . . . The poor baby was sucking its fingers and drinking cow's milk in
    a room far removed from its mother, waiting for the hired woman who
     was to nurse it. The father was in a great rush to have the ceremony of
    the baptism over, so the little creature could be sent to the village . . . 3

    The husband seems to be deliberately structuring this situation to mini­
mize the mother's contact with her baby-in a "room far removed." It was a

procedure that allowed few opportunities for infant cues to elicit nurturing
emotions, thus inhibiting formation of any bonds between mother and infant.
Absence of maternal responses under these conditions tells us little about
innate potentials of the mammal in question.
    Once out the door, the baby might find her wet nurse waiting in the
        '
meneur s cart, ready to hold her and feed her during the long, rough trip back
to the wet nurse's rural home . Otherwise only the meneur would show up,
leading a horse with baskets strapped to its back. Instances of babies lost
along the way occasionally surfaced in police reports for Lyons and Paris. For
babies who reached their destination, it was still less than certain that the
woman waiting there would have sufficient milk. No wonder peasants who
heard a church bell ring simply shrugged,"It's nothing, a little Parisian died!'"*
   Propaganda About Hired "Killers"
Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century authorities became increasingly con­
cerned. They were worried about the high levels of infant mortality and pop­
ulation decline, as well as "public morality" (that is, they were distressed by
the sight of women working outside the home). References to "natural law"
and the "sacred duty" of mothers abound in testimony before committees
drafting legislation on wet-nursing and infant abandonment. 5
   Reformers, who had a stake in romanticizing instinctive maternal devo­
tion, likewise had a vested interest in identifying the use of a wet nurse with
the worst possible motivations. It became convenient to lump a range of
parental choices into one category-wet-nursing-and to identify a wide
range of intentions under one motive: infanticide. Such propaganda was
especially rife by the time France belatedly passed the Roussel Law of 1874,
which was designed to protect infants from the worst excesses of wet­
nursing.
   Medical doctors called in to testify as expert witnesses stressed the mur­
derous intentions of mothers who hired other women to nurse their babies.
French reformer Dr. Alexander Mayer described the practice of"ahandoning,
a few hours after its birth, a cherished being, whose coming was ardently
desired, to a coarse peasant woman whom one has never seen, whose charac­
ter and morality one docs not know," condemning the practice as "barbaric.'>6

propaganda and was quickly absorbed into common parlance. In England,
anaelmaker was common slang for wet nurse; the German equivalent was

then does not carrv the fetus to term, or who after birth docs not care for the

                    MOTHERS         AND   ALLOMOTHERS
    In  1 8 6!), Dr.Mayer correctly prophesized that "T he whole thing is so
revolting to good sense and morality that in twenty years people will refuse
to believe [wet-nursing] ever happened ."9 Today, scholars who recall this era
tend to follow Dr. Mayer's lead."It must have been common knowledge,"
writes twentieth-century psychoanalyst Maria Piers in her book lrifanticide,
that the wet nurse the parents hired was "a professional feeder and a profes­
sional killer.... "10 Wet nurses, proclaims another modern commentator,
"were surrogates upon whom parents could depend for a swift demise for
unwanted children."11
    In the absence of other forms of birth control, women's maternal
responses were heavily influenced by an amalgam of old and new rules.Old
mammalian decision rules for dealing with tradeoffs between subsistence and
reproduction were reinforced by a conscious pragmatism on the part of
mothers. For example, if she continued to care for a particular infant, would
she lose her job? If she lost her job, how would she and her family survive? On
the other hand, could she improve her lot (the nest egg she might accrue, the
better home she might provide), if only she were free from current encum­
brance by the infant? In fact, few mothers were seeking to kill their babies.
Many, however, were trying to reduce the toll infants born inopportunely
would take on their well-being and future prospects. Add to that equation the
heavy hand of fathers who were, among other things, eager to resume conju­
gal relations.
    Propaganda about maternal intentions notwithstanding, allomaternal
sharing of milk must have first occurred among foragers where women coop­
crated to keep each other's babies from fretting. Wet-nursing in this much
earlier context provided a means for individuals to keep infants alive and con­
tented, not kill them . How might this first voluntary sharing of milk have
been transformed into the commercialized networks that we know about
from more complex, stratified societies? We cannot hope to understand how
tens of thousands of mothers became enmeshed in an intricate traffic in
mother's milk, or evaluate what the wet-nursing era docs or docs not tell us
about human "maternal instinct," unless we start at the beginning.
    Mother's milk, with its special immunological and nutritional properties,
has always been too valuable to share indiscriminately. Among other
primates, it is rare for· a mother to let another female's offspring nurse
from her.12 When milk is provided by allomothers, it is volunteered by kin
on a short-term, opportunistic basis. Alternatively, an older infant, the mon-
                 OLD    TRADEOFfS,          NEW    CONTEXTS                  H7
key equivalent of a toddler, might take the initiative, latching on to a
related female's nipples and being tolerated.13 Such suckling is more nearly
a quick pick-me-up, tiding a youngster over, than a primary source of
nutrition. H
    A look at ethnographic accounts of mothers and their daughters, sisters,
or cowivcs who proffer breast milk to one another's offspring reveals a simi­
lar pattern of casual reciprocity, opportunistically offered and received. From
Efc net-hunters in the Ituri Forest to the fisherfolk of the Andaman Islands,
allomatcrnal suckling was a mutually beneficial courtesy extended by coresi­
dent women-affines, neighbors, and blood kin.15
    How Flexible Lactation Is
Evidence that such casual wet-nursing was ever an important part of Pleis­
tocene lifestyles is purely circumstantial. Nevertheless, several features of
woman's biology improved the odds that lactating allomothcrs would have
been available. So far, the only pheromone identified for humans is the mys­
terious substance that causes one woman to synchronize ovulation with
another. If synchrony of ovulation meant that women living together gave
birth at the same time, this would facilitate reciprocal suckling. But lactation
in women, as in most primates, is extraordinarily flexible anyway. This is why
mothers who stop lactating for a time (as during illness) can resume and
begin rebuilding their milk supply as soon as they recover. Milk supply builds
up in response to infant demand, and lactation can be sustained almost indef­
initely until either mother or infant shuts down production through weaning.
(This is how novelist Jane Austen came to be the seventh child in her family to
                                     6
suckle from the same wet nurse.)1
    In a pinch, lactation can be induced without an allomothcr ever becoming
pregnant. Adoptive mothers-girls as young as eight, grandmothers as old as
eighty17-have lactated. But this took more than a miracle. Breasts have to be
kneaded and massaged past many women's endurance, and nipples sucked
(some women usc baby animals) long enough to trigger endogenous produc­
tion of prolactin and oxytocin. 18 In allomothers able to produce milk, there is
no colostrum, but otherwise the composition of induced milk is adequate to

    Anthropologists have not paid much attention to induced lactation. Yet
there is a telling pattern in the dozen or so accounts that exist. Whether from
India, Africa, Indonesia, North or South America, when induced lactation is
                  MOTHERS           AND      ALLOMOTHERS
mentioned, the milk provider is most often an old woman, usually one nurs­
ing orphaned or fostered grandchildren. 20 Besides being more willing and
not otherwise engaged in reproductive pursuits, grandmothers are ideal in
another respect. For physiological reasons, a woman who has already lactated
is three times more likely to induce lactation successfully than a woman who
has never borne a child.21
    Coerced Wet-Nursing
Among those foragers and horticulturalists who practice wet-nursing,
women voluntarily offer their breasts as a favor to another woman's child.
Even when disputes erupt over who stays in camp and who goes off to for­
age, 22 the benefits are so obviously reciprocal that matters resolve them­
selves. More exploitative forms of nonreciprocal wet-nursing could not arise
until there was one class of mothers able to compel lower-ranking mothers to
make their breasts available.
    There are multiple precedents for coerced wet-nursing in other mam­
mals, especially those with cooperative breeding systems (discussed in chap­
ter 4). The behaviors involved are neither very specialized nor unusual. Take
the pack of wild dogs in which the dominant female killed all but one of the
pups in a subordinate female's litter. As the subordinate continued to suckle
her lone surviving pup, the dominant mother's ten pups, already larger than
the lone survivor, took over her teats. The wet nurse's last pup remained
stunted and, when the pack moved, fell behind and would have died had the
observers not rescued him. 23
    But as to when in human prehistory one mother first appropriated the milk
of another, no one has offered even a guess. By the third millennium B.C. it
occurred to aSumerian mother (the wife ofShulgi, ruler ofUr) while singing
her son to sleep to promise the child a wife when he grows up, and then a
son-complete with a wet nurse:
    The nursemaid joyous cif heart will sin9 to him;
    The nursemaid joyous cif heart will suckle him. . . 24
                                                        .
In the time of Homer, in the eighth century B.C., some wellborn sons (like
prince Odysseus) were suckled hy servants, while others in the same popula­
tion were nursed by their own mothers.
                OLD TRADEOFFS,             NEW    CONTEXTS                   H9
    Some wet nurses were themselves from privileged backgrounds, their sta­
tus further cle,·ated hy contact with small scions. In ancient Egypt, wet
nurses were n.'ci·uited from the harems of the pharaoh's senior officials (an
ingenious way to elicit loyalty), and these allomothers subsequently appeared
on the guest lists for royal funeral feasts. Around 1330 B.C., KingTut built a
tomb to honor his wet nurse. 25Thc child of one royal wet nurse from ancient
Egypt was permitted to usc the title "milk-sister to the king." Similar respect
was accorded wet nurses in India, China, Japan, and the Ncar East. 26 In Arab
cultures, Islamic law provides for three kinds of kinship: by blood, hy mar­
riage, and by the happenstance of two individuals having sucked milk from
the same woman.
    Less fortunate wet nurses were effectively slaves with wretched options.
Dozens of texts and manuals survive telling parents what to look for in a
good wet nurse. Virtually all advise against selecting a woman who is preg­
nant or still nursing her own infant. Given that wet nurses arc often not well
nourished, there was a legitimate concern that the nurse might not he able to
make enough milk for two infants. Without so much as a comment on the
implications, parents were advised to find a wet nurse who had recently given
birth and whose milk was still "new." Thus do the manuals display a stark dis­
regard for the well-being of the wet nurse's own infant. Her seemingly dis­
pensable baby is assumed to have died, been weaned very early, or been
farmed out to another woman, possibly to be fed something other than
mother's milk. "Pap," a gruel mixture of water and ground meal used in "dry­
nursing," was usually lethal for newborns.
   The fifteenth-century correspondence between an Italian merchant and
his wife chronicles that enterprising woman's efforts to find a suitable wet
nurse for one of her husband's clients.27 She has her eye on a particular slave
whose own infant seems likely to die. The merchant's wife makes no secret of
her disappointment when the slave's baby survives. Historian RichardTrexler
notes that about 3 o percent of infants sent to foundling homes during this
period of the Renaissance were the offspring of slaves, whose owners had
                            8
other uses for their milk. 2
   The Wet Nurses
Of all the protagonists in these transactions, we know least about the wet
nurses themselves. Whether slaves or just <lestitute peasants, the price of con-
                  MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
tinued survival was providing milk to unrelated offspring at the expense of
their own. Some wet nurses may have been country girls hoping to earn a
dowry and then marry and reproduce in earnest. Many no doubt became
quite attached to their charges. Yet fe w would have been permitted contact
 with their charges after weaning. We know almost nothing about the psycho­
logical trauma these ruptured attachments caused infants and their care­
takers.
    The demographic consequences, however, are known. Lactational sup­
pression of ovulation delayed the wet nurse's next conception. Yet this long
interval between births was not offset by increased survival of her own
infants. Only rarely did her circumstances improve, permitting her to offset
early losses by producing healthier offspring later. For her, wet-nursing was a
losing proposition all around.
    There are hints that in spite of the hopelessness of their position, wet
nurses sometimes tried, with varying success, to subvert a system heavily
biased against mothers nursing their own children. From Moses' mother to
the Russian women who bribed foundling home personnel, some mothers
managed to get themselves paid to nurse their own babies. W herever they
could, mothers strategized to improve their lot. Rarely could they succeed.
Nevertheless, substitution of one baby for another-the source of much
topsy-turvy merriment in Gilbert and Sullivan-was taken seriously enough
in ancient Mesopotamia to merit dire punishment. Switching babies was
specifically prohibited in the Code ofHammurabi (17oo B.C.). If a wet nurse
was caught doing so, "they shall cut off her breast."29
    High Fertility Plus High Survival
From medieval times onward, wet nurses-paid, indentured, enslaved­
could be found in elite households in Europe, Asia, and the Near East. Care
was taken to select a nonpregnant nurse with a healthy supply of milk. Living
in aristocratic households, closely supervised, infants nursed by such wet
nurses had about the same survival rates-sometimes better-as infants
nursed by their own mothers. For a baby born in Lieutenant LeNoir's sample
from eighteenth-century France, survival chances were around So percent
hoth for the tiny fraction nursed by their own mothers and those with the
good fortune to be wet•nursed in their parents' home. 30
    Far from increasing infant mortality, wet nurses situate<! in privileged
homes permitted elites to bypass a normal mammalian constraint. By com-

Fig. 14.3 Prior to World War II, hospitals in the United States still hired wet nurses to feed pre­
mature babies. The wet nurse was allowed to continue nursing her own infant, both for her peace
of mind and because stimulation of one nipple by the sucking of the stronger hahy produced a
let-down reflex that made it easier for the weaker "preemie" to obtain milk. Hospital administra­
tors calculated that wet nurses provided two to three hundred ounces of milk in exchange for a
salary of eight dollars a wcek.ll (Courre'J·ofSJ'ndics ofCambridEJ< Uniwsi'J' I.Jbra'J)
mandeering the milk of other women, elite wives became pregnant again
much sooner without subjecting their infants to higher mortality. They cir­
cumvented the tradeoff between "quantity" and "quality" of care. In fact,
some infants (especially if they were daughters, who might otherwise have
been weaned early so their mothers could get pregnant again hopefully to
produce a son) were wet-nursed lonoer than they would have been breast-fed
by their own mothers.
    For elites, \\·et-nursing meant high fertility plus high probability of infant
sunival. In a not atypical case, one eighteenth-century British duchess who
gave birth to her first child at age sixteen, a year after her marriage, contin­
ued reproducing for thirty more years, until her twenty-first child was born
when she was forty-six. 32 Eight surviving offspring-which would be a
record-breaking level of reproductive success for a hunter-gatherer-was
merely averao e for women in her circle. Typically, wives gave birth almost

ti\'es for hiring them. Gabrielle d'Estrces bore Henri IV of France three children out of wedlock.
Renowned for her beauty, detested for the wealth and influence it brought her, she might have
achie\·ed her ambition to see one of her sons succeed to the throne of France had she not died at

production of plentiful heirs. More likely, her choice was dictated by convenience, her ambitious
preoccupation with machinations at court, and her desire to prcscr\'c compact, symmetrical,
youthful-looking breasts. E\·en more than for most women, \'anity was relevant to a courtesan's

annually for the first decade of marriage , slowing to a more gradual pace for
the second. In isolated pockets of Europe, rapid production of many children
at short intervals continued to he the norm into the nineteenth century. 34
     Fine-Tuning Parental Investment
The longer a mother nursed her baby, the more likely it was to survive.
Mothers could safely wean early only when water did not cause dysentery,
                OLD     TRADEOFFS,          NEW     CONTEXTS
and where alternatives to breast milk were nutritious and palatable. But
unless an observer is right there counting "time on the nipple" and "time off"
(the way primatologists do), it's rarely possible to know when weaning actu­
ally occurs. With wet nurses it is. When payment stopped so did the likeli­
hood that the infant still had access to breast milk.
    Consider a remarkable study of the intimate lives of Renaissance Floren­
tine families. From household diaries, called ricordanze, historian Christiane
Klapisch-Zuber determined that one family out of three was more likely to
have a son nursed in casa-the costlier, safer arrangement preferred by
fifteenth-century elites. This in-house wet nurse was supervised by the
mother. When infants were sent to wet nurses away from home, they were
more likely to be daughters-69 percent of daughters born, compared with
55 percent of sons, and mostly these were later-born, younger sons, "heirs to
spare." Even then, parents paid more so their sons would be nursed a month
and a half longer on average than their daughters. 35
    How Could Love, If"Natural;' Be Discriminatory?
"How could it be that love, if it were indeed natural and spontaneous, would
be directed toward one child more than another?" asked Elisabeth Badinter
with her usual crisp logic. How could a mother care assiduously for a first­
born son and then "send the younger children away for many years?"36 Yet,
unequal treatment of progeny is only a problem for those who equate biology
with genetic determinism, who assume that irrespective of maternal age or
condition, or of the viability or even sex of her progeny, all mothers are the
same, an invariant phenotype MOTHER.
    This, of course, is true if the invariant constant (the so-percent chance of
sharing genes by common descent) is all that matters. But in the pragmatic
and not-at-all-nice domain of Mother Nature, mothers evolved to factor in
costs (which, in the human case, can range from mother's age or physical
condition to a conscious awareness of future costs) as weB as to factor in ben­
efits (for example, a social milieu that offers sons better opportunities than
daughters).
    Evolutionarily, the simplest way to explain maternal behavior is as a spe­
cial case of Hamilton's rule (see above, page 6 3) to explain altruistic acts
between related individuals. Applied in this context, Hamilton's rule is not so
much about genes (after all, no one has any idea what is going on at the level
of genes, or what mechanisms are involved) as it is about predicting when
                   MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
one individual should incur a cost on behalf of another. At this level, Hamil­
ton's rule is a formally organized metaphor for how natural selection shaped
the economy of maternal emotions, with C being the cost to the donor, B
being the benefit to the recipient, and r being the degree of relatedness:
                                      C < Br
    Far from disproving the relevance of biology, models based jointly on
Hamilton's rule and life-history theory predict that indeed, yes, parents
would invest differentially in offspring according to their circumstances. A
mother would alter her commitment according to how likely an infant of a
particular sex or condition was to enhance the well-being of the family or
translate parental investment into long-term reproductive success. Like the
cases of sex-selective infanticide in the previous chapter, decisions about wet­
nursing are another empirically measurable index that reveals biases in
parental decision-making. T he life story of the French diplomat and statesman
Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord is a case in point, one that probably
had lasting repercussions for the history of nations as well as individuals.
   Talleyrand was the second-born son of an ancient and powerful family that
had-like many others in the eighteenth century-fallen on financial hard
times. After their first son and heir was born and wet-nursed at home, the
family opted to economize on wet-nursing costs by sending their second son
to be nursed on the outskirts of Paris. When the older son died, his parents
immediately retrieved Talleyrand, the son now designated their heir. To their
dismay, the toddler had been allowed to tumble off a chest while with the wet
nurse, had injured his foot, and was crippled for life. Hence when a third son
was born, a family council was convened and it was decided that Talleyrand
would not be a credit to the family and should forfeit his right of primogeni­
ture and enter the church, a vocation he eventually abandoned. T he rest is
history, History writ large, as this clever, calculating, and utterly cynical man
became a key advisor to Napoleon.
   Costs of Rapid Reproduction Borne by Wives
When wives not using other forms of birth control delegated breast-feeding
to wet nurses , one consequence was shorter birth intervals. Because their
wet-nursed infants (especially those nursed in-house) generally survived, the
outcome was larger completed family sizes for well-off families. Some of the
unintended consequences for the mother, however, included obstetrical diffi-

 Women's Bodies. W hile elite fathers, especially those married to successive
wh·es, enjoyed unprecedented reproductive success, their wives more nearly
suffered it; many died young and most (like Emma Darwin, who bore I o
infants) dreaded frequent confinements.
    From such glimpses as we are permitted, it is clear that the pronatalist
push was mostly coming from husbands and from their families rather than
from mothers themselves. Mothers wanted children-just not quite so
many. Having produced the requisite male heir, some women insisted on nurs­
ing so as to step off the reproductive treadmi11. Well-spaced, healthy children
(quality over quantity) suited her better. 38
    But more than conscious pronatalism was at stake. In France, husbands
had an extra incentive to get their babies to wet nurses. They wanted their
conjugal privileges, and the Catholic church discouraged sex between hus­
bands and nursing mothers, perhaps for the same reasons so many cultures
do. Postpartum sex taboos are found across traditional societies from North
and South America to New Guinea and Africa, presumably as an extra
precaution, a failsafe to guard against a new sibling being born too soon. 39
Ironically, a custom that originated because it increased infant survival by
guaranteeing longer birth intervals more often had the opposite effect in
Catholic countries. Sending infants out to wet nurses probably led to far
more infant deaths than abbreviated birth intervals due to the occasional
impregnation of a nursing mother.
                   MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
    Maternal resistance to rapid births may have contributed to the early
adoption of birth control in France. For reasons not yet well understood,
birth rates among French elites dropped faster and sooner than elsewhere in
Europe, where the demographic transition did not get under way until the
end of the nineteenth century. Rousseau's campaign to convince parents to
treat all children equally may have been partly responsible. But pressure to
limit family size as a way of maintaining family status was already building.
    Since, formerly, status and well-being tended to be correlated with repro­
ductive success, it is not surprising that mothers, especially those in higher
social ranks, put the basics first. When confronted with a choice between
striving for status and striving for children, mothers gave priority to status
and "cultural success" ahead of a desire for many children.40
    If instead of channeling wealth to one son (through primogeniture) par­
ents had to treat all offspring e qually (which became the law of the land in
France in 1 8o4 with the adoption of the Napoleonic Code), then producing
fewer heirs was essential if a propertied family was to maintain its social and
economic standing. For this and other reasons (again, poorly understood),
mothers anxious about maintaining their descendants' privileged status took
steps to reduce their family sizes. These smaller family sizes (closer to five
than ten) more nearly resembled those of their foraging ancestors than the
large offspring sets characteristic of the eighteenth century. Smaller fami­
lies reduced pressure to economize on the amount of investment parents
committed to each offspring and permitted mothers the luxury of an En­
lightenment ethic regarding child-rearing. Many people think of the smaller,
post-demographic transition , family sizes as unusual. But they arc not. They
arc more nearly a reversion to an earlier species norm.
    Spread of Commercial Wet-Nursing
Long before the demographic transition, wet-nursing had seeped down the
social ladder, leading to a wide-scale traffic in mother's milk. Commercial
wet-nursing peaked in eighteenth-century Europe, but precursors can he
traced far earlier. Documents written on papyrus in 300 B.C. indicate that
free women in Hellenistic Egypt, not just slaves, were contracting to prm·ide
breast milk.41 By the second century A.D., selling access to a woman's breast
was a routine commercial transaction, and in the vegetable market at Rome's
Forum Holitorium, buyers met with sellers in a place called the lactaria (des­
ignated by a column).

    Commercial wet-nursing was already far removed from the casual, volun­
tary nursing found among foragers and hor ticulturalists . Eventually, having a
wet nurse became a symbol of high status. Most likely, the practice of
enforced or contractual (rather than reciprocal) wet-nursing first became
established among elites. Thereafter it became an enviable option that sub­
elites sought to emulate. O nly later did the practice of using a wet-nurse
spread among working mothers. As the custom spread from elites to suh­
clitcs,'�1 wet-nursing offered a novel solution to a perennial dilemma: How is
a mother to engage in status- or subsistence-related activities without being
burdened by an infant? Once again, mother's immediate well-being and per­
haps the needs of older children past the perilous first years of life took
precedence over caring for a particular infant.
Down the economic scale in the pre-bottle world, the usc of wet nurses was a
late addition to the human repertoire. It had little to do with sparing a wife
from the drudgery of nursing her baby, or helping her keep shapely breasts,
or causing her to become pregnant again sooner-though these were out­
comes. Rather, the mother's labor was essential either to her own subsistence
or (as in the case of butchers and artisans) to the family economy. Nursing an
infant interfered with her efficiency at a time when the line between bour­
geois status and destitution was perilously narrow. Given the tradeoff's, she
opted for the wet nurse. Nor would it surprise me to find modern mothers
once again seeking to hire others to nurse their babies as they read articles
touting the benefits of breast-feeding for their children's security, intelli­
gence, and immunological sy stems. Many more will take advantage of breast
pumps to provide a personal stock to daycare providers.
    Quest for Affordable Care
During the eighteenth century, the population in France grew from 2o mil­
lion to 27 million.41 In the country side, poor har vests plus the fractioning of
small landholdings among several sons swelled the numbers of the dispos­
sessed. Providing for oneself was difficult, providing for a family even
tougher. A man whose wife did not work could not expect to earn enough to
support a family. Hence, the arrival of additional children meant disaster if
the mother had to quit working.
                   MOTHERS        AND     ALLOMOTHERS
     Desperate peasants migrated to cities, but their subsistence remained
marginal. Rapid urbanization combined with slow industrialization trans­
lated into few opportunities, not only for parents but for such children as
survived. Incomes were low, rents high, the price of bread rising faster than
wages. Many of the French mothers who sent their infants to wet nurses were
working women barely eking out a precarious existence-"bourgeois" but
only by the skin of their teeth. The more involved the wife was in helping her
husband-whether in a store or some craft like silk-making-the more
likely the family was to use a wet nurse.44 At any given point in time, need for
the mother's labor was a better predictor of what would be done with the
infant (kept at home, sent to a wet nurse, left at a foundling home) than were
infant mortality rates. How could this be?
     Historian George Sussman calculates a typical budget for a family of arti­
sans. Nearly half of the family's earned monthly income would go for food,
 1 5 percent for clothing, 6 percent for light and heat, and another t 3 percent
for rent. In addition, each wet-nursed child could cost eight livres a month-
 2o percent of the family budget, so long as the family could afford to keep up
the payments.
     In short, working mothers sent their babies farther and farther away, not
to get them legally killed but primarily in quest of affordable care. It was not
maternal nature (always contingent on circumstances) that changed through
time, but maternal options. Rubber nipples and pasteurized milk would not
be available until the end of the nineteenth century. Practically speaking, wet
nurses were the only safe alternative to a mother breast-feeding her own
baby. Trouble was, working mothers were in competition with elites who
paid as much as several hundred livres a year to have wet nurses live in their
homes. (Wet nurses themselves were often hard-pressed to find low-cost
care for their own displaced infants.) Parents in search of affordable wet
nurses would also have been in competition with foundling homes.
     Yet somehow, bourgeois parents did locate wet nurses, and in a world
w ithout other forms of birth control, wet-nursing produced the same effect
among those mothers as it had among the elites: a staggering hyperfertility,
but with a cruel difference. Among sub-elites, high fertility came coupled
with high rates of infant mortality.
     Working women routinely produced twelve to sixteen children. In his
remarkable social history of bourgeois families in Lyons during this period,
                OLD TRADEOFFS,             NEW     CONTEXTS
French demographic historian Maurice Garden describes one butcher's wife
who produced twenty-one children in twenty-four years.45 Survival chances
of these children were directly correlated with how much their parents paid
for wet-nursing. Abandonment was free, but about the time Lieutenant­
General LeNoir was tallying his statistics, mortality rates in the foundling
homes around Paris hit 8) percent Also about that time, one year of wet­
                                       .
nursing in a rural location went for 1 oo livres and reduced mortality rates by
half-to 40 percent or lower.
    Even six months of wet-nursing could make the difference between life
and death. Around 1 o percent of working parents eventually defaulted on
payments to the wet nurse, with the result that their babies ended up in a
foundling home. Yet the head start provided by just six months at the breast of
a paid wet nurse boosted survival chances of an infant subsequently con­
signed to a foundling home .In-house wet-nursing, while more than twice the
cost of a rural wet nurse, cut the mortality rate by another half, down to 2o
percent-the same as if a mother nursed the baby herself.46
    Daycare as Modified Wet-Nursing
Perhaps the closest analogy to what went on with wet-nursing is what we
modern mothers go through when we scrounge and compromise to locate
affordable infant daycare, mercifully nine-to-five (not including weekends),
and not nearly so wretched nor so deadly as wet-nursing.
    Of 21 million children under the age of six in the United States in 1 99 5,
1 2 million were in daycare. Of infants less than one year old, 45 percent were
in some kind of daycare.47 Mothers seek this care in a market where wealthy,
nonworking mothers, highly paid women professionals, ordinary working
women, and mothers pushed off welfare into the labor market at minimum
wages, not to mention government agencies seeking to place foster children ,
are all competing for alloparental care, a commodity not in abundant supply
to begin with. A 1998 New York Times article on the "acute lack of daycare"
faced by mothers being pressured from "welfare" into "workfare" notes that
    three quarters of the mothers in workfare rely on unlicensed baby sit­
    ters who are also paid by the city. The lucky ones enlist trusted relatives
    or close friends.The less fortunate leave their sons and daughters in
    crowded, dirty apartments with caretakers they barely know.... 48
370                 MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
    Just like working mothers today, eighteenth-century European mothers
weighed infant care from wholesome nurses close to home against affordabil­
ity. A critical difference was that the severely sub-par eighteenth-century
infant daycare/nightcare entailed far less parental supervision, far greater
risks to infant health, and far worse psychological risks from ruptured emo­
tional attachments.
    Alternative Ways to Mitigate Costs of Care
Dual-career mothers, whether they forage or go to work, have always sought
ways to mitigate the costs of infant care. Today, mothers hire nannies, leave
children in government-run creches, maternales, or daycare centers; they del­
egate childcare to kin; or else they continue caring for infants themselves but
reduce the amount of care given to each infant. Reductions range from leav­
ing an infant in a car-seat for fifteen minutes while running an errand, to
neglect so pronounced it results in an infant's failure to thrive. In the more
extreme cases, consequences of these tactics are measurable. More often they
are not. Even when maternal retrenchment affects morbidity or infant mor­
tality, the effects of maternal decisions do not leave a measurable trace .
    Societies where infanticide is unthinkable, where infants are never sent to
suckle at some hired woman's breasts, nor left in bundles along roadsides,
nor swaddled and hung from trees, tend to be societies in which women have
some degree of reproductive autonomy and access to some fairly reliable
form of birth control. Or else, they are societies where mothers have at their
disposal social customs or institutions for delegating some care to aBo­
mothers.
    Just as European infants were once left in foundling homes or sent to wet
nurses at near epidemic levels, today we witness poor mothers from the
Philippines, Central and South America, South Africa, and Asia leaving chil­
dren behind to be bottle-fed and somehow cared for by kin while they them­
selves go far away to work as housekeepers and caretakers for other people's
children. Solutions differ, but the tradeoffs mothers make, and the underlying
emotions and mental calculations, remain the same.
    Fostering Out, and Other Ways
    to Delegate Care·to Alloparents
"Where every child is a wanted child" is, appropriately enough, the slogan for
Planned Parenthood, an admirable organization that seeks to help mothers
                   OLD      TRAI>EOI'I'S,           NEW       CONTEXTS                      37'

time births and space offspring in line with maternal health and family needs.
In this ideal world, every child is wanted because maternal conditions and
moth·ations are taken into account. In terms of Hamilton's rule, the same
outcome could be produced other ways-for example, by reducing the cost
of each infant and/or by spreading that cost among alloparents.
     Some years ago David Kcrtzcr, the anthropologist studying Italian found­
lings, pointed out that poverty, by itself, was a poor predictor of infant aban­
donment. Sardinia was a case in point. During the same period when large
372                 MOTHERS       AND    ALLOMOTHERS
numbers of infants were being abandoned in Tuscany, Sicily, and elsewhere in
Italy, virtually no babies were abandoned in this poorest of Italy's regions.
Between I 879 and I88 I, when 69,ooo babies were left at foundling homes in
Sicily, only fifteen were abandoned in Sardinia. Kertzer attributes this near
absence of infant abandonment to Sardinia's mother-centered family organi­
zation. Daughters remained near kin, so that even unmarried girls would
have a "supportive network of female kin."49
    As has always been true, availability of matrilineal kin-sisters, mothers,
and grandmothers-makes for an especially reliable source of allomaternal
assistance. Not quite a beehive, but far more valuable than a village, an
extended family of matrilineal kin turns out to be a wonderful resource for
rearing human infants.
Imagine a place where household incomes are low and fertility is as high as
anywhere in the world. Many fathers are only sporadically in residence with
the mothers of their children; and fathers, when they are on the scene, may be
unpredictable regarding which children they invest in, and how much. A
substantial number of women conceive at a young age, often prior to mar­
riage or formation of any stable relationship. Even with the assistance of the
father, parents may not have sufficient resources to provide for all their chil­
dren. T here is no government assistance of any kind for mothers with depen­
dent children. Nor are there government-sponsored institutions to take in
foundlings, nor churches to accept oblates-children given as gifts to the
Church, a common practice in medieval Europe. Yet abortion is uncommon
and infanticide rarer still. Wartime catastrophes aside, infants are never aban­
doned outright. And despite the rarity of baby bottles, the practice of one
mother hiring another to provide breast milk to her baby is unknown.
    This description applies to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa, especially
those areas that the economist Ester Boserup characterized years ago as hav­
ing "female systems"-by which Boserup meant relying on hoe agriculture,
in which women are highly valued for their labor. It is a traditional way of life
associated with maternal inheritance of garden plots and the existence of
strong networks of female kin. 50 Many Africans would regard the thousands
of European mothers who abandoned their infants at foundling homes as
extraordinary creatures, acting outside the range of human behavior. Instead,
                 OLD     TRADEO!lllS,      NEW     CONTEXTS                 373
among them one hears traditional proverbs like"If you have a child, you have
a lifc."s1 Even in the face of rapid change in some areas--including the devas­
tating effects of AIDS, which has begun to undermine and overwhelm these
time-honored childcare networks-key aspects of this system remain intact.
    Throughout most .of Africa, children arc passionately desired by both
sexes, although fathers want more of them than mothers do. Mothers breast­
feed infants for a long time, and, with varying success, maintain postpartum
bans against sex while the mother's current child is deemed too young to
make way for a new sibling. It is part of the usual maternal campaign for rais­
ing viable children in the face of the male desire for quantity. Only as fathers
begin to invest more in each child-to"do more of their share," as is happen­
ing with moder nization-do husbands begin to appreciate their wives' con­
cern for spacing or limiting births.
    A number of anthropologists have commented on the resistance of tradi­
tional African men to any form of birth control, especially condoms. Many
women who take the pill must do so in secret. The primary interest of these
women does not seem to be to quit childbearing, but rather to space births
more widely apart (which, of course, does ultimately limit completed family
size).
    Adults genuinely enjoy indulging little children. And why not? Children
are viewed as ties to the ancestors as well as links to the future in a world of
mystifyingly rapid change whose idiosyncrasies children grasp more readily
than their elders. Grown children, especially those who find a niche for
themselves in modern Africa, offer the only old-age insurance there is. Even a
remote father who rarely sees his children-and relatively few fathers pro­
vide a great deal of direct care-derives prestige and political clout from hav­
ing them . Grown children acknowledge the "very great debt" owed to those
who cared for them when young. It is not just gifts of food and cash from the
parents, but this prospect that their former charges will feel obliged to care
for them one day, that makes foster mothers eager to take youngsters in.
    Such foster mothers-who may be real or fictive kin-arc often postre­
productive and are generally given the generic title "granny." Across large
areas of west, cast and southern Africa grannies provide the closest real-life
example of Boswell's vision of"kind strangers" and recycled children. Moth­
ers routinely send one or more children to live in a foster home, either with
one of these "grannies" or among prosperous connections who can offer
advantages in schooling, better nutrition, or other opportunities. The genetic
374               MOTHERS         AND    ALLOMOTHERS
mother and the man socially recognized as the father stay in touch and send
gifts of food and money.
    But kinship and the gifts arc not the only reason grannies take in charges.
As one of them put it, "You never know whether the children will love you
more than their own mothers and thus bring you sufficient benefit." A com­
mentator observed more philosophically that "Children are like young bam­
boo trees; you don't know which of the shoots will be cut away and which
will remain"-nor how any given child will turn out.
    Caroline Bledsoe, an anthropologist who has studied the fosterage system
among the Mende people of West Africa, describes what happens when a
particularly enterprising or lucky child makes good. Numbers of relatives,
including long-absent fathers, show up to stake their claim. The logic of the
lottery is explicit in the mind of the West African man who told her: "It is
good to bring up or mind a lot of children because you don't know which one
will be successful. However it may be, one must be successful, and you will

get your reward out of your expendIture.
    People understand that mothers might not want children born too closely
together. But not wanting a child is incomprehensible. Serious misunder­
standings have occurred when West African parents living abroad took advan­
tages of what seemed wonderful opportunities to foster their children with
Western families who could offer them a better education, higher standard of
living, and valuable contacts. The Westerners mistakenly believed that they
were adopting unwanted children. The parents, however, assumed the chil­
dren were only being temporarily fostered and expected them to be returned.
    African villagers arc genuinely shocked when ethnographers inquire
about infanticide. They are mystified by the mindsets of foragers in parts of
the world like lowland Amazonia, where the proverbs have quite a different
ring to them. Africans cannot imagine anyone saying, as some Amazonian
                                                      "53

    A story told by the demographer Nancy Howell illustrates how attitudes
of sedentary African horticulturalists with readily available caretakers differ
from other Africans who still live as nomadic foragers. Among the nomadic
!Kung San, the number of babies a mother can care for is limited by the fact
that she must be able to carry them wherever she goes. A group of Bantu
women came across a !Kung woman who had gone into the bush to give
birth. The poor woman, still somewhat dazed, had just realized that her baby
had been born with a birth defect, and she felt it was her duty to abandon the

                                         their very different ethic, persuaded her to
                                         keep it. 54
                                              Among the Bantu, a woman's experi­
                                         ence is quite unlike that of a ! Kung mother.
                                         A number of people (primarily mother's
                    ..· ...  �... ·:�.t�
                                         kin) routinely care for each child. At any
given point in time in a broad area of West and South Africa, up to 40 percent
of mothers of childbearing age will have sent infants already weaned, or in
the process of being weaned, to live with a "granny" or to the home of a well­
to-do relation. In some areas, availability of a maternal grandmother is signif­
icantly correlated with the child's survival. 55
    Even a ,·cry inopportune child is still wanted by parents, so long as others
arc a\·ailablc to help rear him.Young mothers, or those who are unmarried or
anticipate inadequate support, arc most likely to rely on a granny. 56 These
belong to the same class of mother who among the Ayoreo would be most
prone to commit infanticide, who in eighteenth-century Europe would aban­
don their babies at a foundling home, or who in impoverished parts of urban
Brazil would opt not to breast-feed a baby even though this means a much
greater risk that it will die. 57 Mothers also send their children to grannies if
they remarry, or if they fear cowivcs may maliciously target their children. 58
    Yet the generosity of "grannies" has its limits. W hen resources arc short,
foster children may get short shrift-particularly those whose parents send
few presents or who arc not really relatives. Children who show little apti­
tude for becoming one of those "little bamboo shoots" that will prosper and
reward their caretaker may be overlooked, or left to scavenge food, or denied
medical care by their foster parents. Odd remarks, inconsistent with the idyl­
lic (and generally correct) impression that every child is a wanted child, arc
 376              MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
sometimes overheard. Anthropologists Robert and Sarah LeVine, who
worked among the Gusii in Kenya, cite a saying worthy of a Dogon cowife:
"Another woman's child is like cold mucus ...."As the LeVines put it, "In a
society that values children above all else, we found nevertheless that some
children were valued more highly than others."59
    Even in traditional Africa, marginalized children are likely to be neglec­
ted.Population growth has aggravated this situation, as there are so many
more children today than adults.The AIDS epidemic has further worsened
this imbalance. Not only does this dread disease produce orphans, but the
mode of transmission makes it likely that whole families-fathers, wives,
cowives-will be affected. There are no longer enough "grannies" to
go around. In some areas of modern Africa, particularly in those cities
where up to one-quarter of pregnant women are HIV-positive, child­
rearing networks are breaking down, leading to wholesale abandonment of
orphans.60
    Continuum of Maternal Commitment
Mothers have always had to make the most of resources at hand while coping
with the sliding scale of paternal and alloparental help available. Mothers
make tradeoffs compatible with their own subsistence, the needs of different
children, and their own future reproductive prospects. These tradeoffs are
made in a world of constantly shifting constraints and options. In foraging
societies, for example, suckling infants are far more costly than older chil­
dren, who are at least mobile.Not so in our own increasingly technological
society, where costs of child-rearing (for example, college tuition) go up­
                                  1
not down-with the child's age.6
   Some mothers encounter completely novel options-like breast milk for
hire in the eighteenth century, or new birth technologies in the twentieth­
that allow women forty-five and older to give birth. A woman who post­
poned reproduction in the Pleistocene was probably waiting out a famine, or
looking forward to a situation with more stable allomaternal assistance.In
the twenty-first century, career women will count on amniocentesis, in vitro
fertilization, and procedures combining the DNA in their own eggs with
cytoplasmic material from a younger woman's eggs to keep reproducing
beyond their prime reproductive years.Such techniques will reduce risks to a
woman from delaying reproduction (allowing her to achieve a desired profes-
                 OLD TRADEOFFS,             NEW    CONTEXTS                  377
sional or social status prior to hearing children), but arc likely to introduce
other 1·isks or tradeoff's yet unknown .
    No social creature, even the most independent woman, makes such deci­
sions in a vacuum. In addition to laws, technologies, and protection from
environmental hazards, there arc today, as in the past, people both more and
less powerful than the mother herself who shape the reproductive options
available to her. Now, as in the past, mothers do not live in any one type of
family arrangement. Nor is there any one species-typical level of maternal
commitment to infants. Without question, historical context matters a great
deal. But to interpret variation in the way mothers respond to infants as
meaning that somehow a woman's biology is irrelevant to her emotions, or
that there are no evolved maternal responses, is to misread both the human
record and a vast amount of evidence for other animals.
    No one suggests that the hundreds of thousands of mothers in eighteenth­
century Europe '"'ho sent babies to wet nurses, or the mothers who aban­
doned infants outright at foundling homes, were typical of all mothers at all
times. In a state of ecological release, in which the costs of caring impinge far
less on the mother's health and well-being, mothers can afford the luxury of
loving each baby born. This is especially likely to be so when women have the
inestimable privilege of consciously planning when births will occur. Never­
theless, the "unnatural" mothers chronicled here can only be the visible tip of
an iceberg of maternal ambivalence that left no record.
    These nuances of maternal emotions and the many "little decisions" moth­
ers make are rarely measurable. For every mother who abandons her infant
outright, there have to be thousands of other mothers who abjured such dra­
conian remedies yet nevertheless fell short of commitment in ways that low­
ered infant viability.
    Legacy of Ambivalence
And what does this degree of ambivalence mean for the notion of"maternal
instinct"? So long as we are clear about what we mean, there is no reason not
to use the shorthand instinctive to describe the adoration of their babies that
mothers feel. Like all primate females, women and girls find babies utterly
enticing and attractive, and most are eager to hold and care for them. This is
especially likely to be true of a recent mother because of the hormonal
changes during pregnancy and birth that lower her threshold for forming an
                   MOTHERS         AND     ALLOMOTHERS
affiliative bond with an especially attractive (in terms of its smell and odd
appearance) little stranger, and such bonds intensify during lactation. Virtu­
ally all female primates, if they remain in close proximity to a small baby long
enough, learn to recognize and form an attachment to that particular baby.
    Every human mother's response to her infant is influenced by a composite
of biological responses of mammalian, primate, and human origin. These
include endocrinal priming during pregnancy; physical changes (including
changes in the brain) during and after birth; the complex feedback loops of
lactation; and the cognitive mechanisms that enhance the likelihood of recog­
nizing and learning to prefer kin. But almost none if these biological responses are
automatic. To survive over evolutionary time, all of these systems had to pass
through the evolutionary crucible so well summarized by Hamilton's rule.
One way or another, whether the cue is fat deposits that influence activation
of the ovaries, or signals indicating that social support is forthcoming, proba­
ble costs and potential benefits are factored in. In humans, whose infants are
so costly, and for whom conscious planning (thanks to the neocortex) is a fac­
tor, maternal investment in offspring is complicated by a range of utterly new
considerations: cultural expectations, gender roles, sentiments like honor or
shame, sex preferences, and the mother's awareness of the future. Such com­
plexities do not erase more ancient predispositions to nurture. All the sys­
tems in this messy composite are vetted according to costs, benefits, and
genetic relatedness to the infant recipient of altruistic maternal acts. But
none of this guarantees perfect synchrony between systems. We should not
be surprised that conflicting motivations emerge at both conscious and
unconscious levels, in ambivalent maternal emotions psychoanalyst Rozsika
Parker sums up as feeling "torn apart."62
    We are still far from understanding how genetically influenced receptors
in the brain, thresholds for responding to different chemical signals, hor­
mone levels, and feelings of anxiety or contentment interact to produce the
myriad "decisions" that continuously affect maternal commitment. Yet this
fact remains: human infants are so vulnerable and dependent for so long a
time, that the level of commitment to them by the close relative on the spot
at birth, primed to care, and lactating, is the single most important compo­
nent of infant well-being.
    Throughout human evolution, the mother has been her infant's niche.
Physical and social circumstances affect the baby as they affect her. W hether
or not an infant ingests colostrum, nurses for five months or five years,
                   OLD TRADEOFFS,            NEW     CONTEXTS                 379
whether a mother keeps her infant nearby or turns him over to an aBo­
mother, each represents a maternal decision with implications for infant sur­
vh·al. Demographically and statistically, multiple, small maternal decisions
about how much to invest, and for how long, in any given infant add up to
life-or-death outcomes for human offspring.
    Other ape neonates cling for dear life to the mother's hair. For human
babies sun-inl is more complicated. There is no environmental hazard more
omnipresent or immediate in its impact than a retrenchment in maternal
care. Consequences of "little maternal decisions" are far more perilous in
some habitats than others. Maintaining maternal commitment was once as
important for an infant's survival as oxygen, and often it still is. Yet there is
little in the routine ethnographic or historical descriptions of mothers to sug­
gest that maintaining adequate maternal commitment was a problem. Is this
because it was not? Or is it, as I believe, because an idealized view of maternal
commitment has been taken for granted for so long, and because decisions
leading to small retrenchments are so unremarkable?
    As birth intervals grew shorter through the course of human evolution
and recent human history, pressure on mothers to delegate caretaking to
others became even more intense. Whenever they safely could, or when they
had little choice, mothers handed babies over to fathers or alloparents,
weaned them early, or swaddled them and hung them from doors. At the psy­
chological level, these decisions differ little from those a contemporary
mother makes everyday when she asks her neighbor to baby-sit or contracts
for more or less adequate daycare. She is playing the odds, and evaluating her
priorities. Hence I am dumbfounded when I hear contemporary politicians
lament "the breakdown of the family" in the modern world. A recent editorial
in the "I'Vall Street Journal complained that "the denigration of the marriage­
the famous 'nuclear family'-was feminism's greatest failure" [leaving in its
wake] "a legacy of children without fathers and women without hus­
bands. . . .''63 Although it is heartening to know that the editors of the Wall
Street Journal are concerned about teen pregnancy and children growing up in
fatherless homes, it is faulty logic to indict feminism for social problems that
are as old as the conflict of interests between men and women, and probably
far older.
    Hominid fathers have been choosing between investing in the children
they already have and finding new mates with whom to sire more for as long
as there has been a division of labor between hunters and gatherers and a
                   MOTHERS        AND    ALLOMOTHERS
practice of hominid males sharing food with immatures. Worldwide, such
tensions have far more to do with the prevalence of female-headed house­
holds than feminism possibly could. Approximately one-third to one-half of
all households in the world are female-headed, most of these in countries too
poor to have been touched by a social movement that is less than two cen­
turies old and so far primarily a luxury that only educated Western women
have been able to afford. 64
    Over the millennia, mothers have factored into their decisions informa­
tion about the effects a particular birth would have on older children; the
probable response of father or stepfather; the infant's own prospects for sur­
vival; and the prospect of translating her efforts into subsequent reproductive
success. Unlike other primates, women possess the capacity to foresee out­
comes. Being born to a wise and foresightful mother would seem like good
fortune to most of us. But it would be a blessing that brought with it peculiar
hazards.
    This is why the human infant, though born especially helpless, has had to
become psychologically sophisticated in specialized ways, attuning himself to
the task of assessing and extracting commitment from those closest to him,
especially his mother. Infancy and childhood comprise the first perilous bot­
tleneck every contributor to the human gene pool must pass through. Small
downward adjustments of maternal priorities regarding a given infant, which
cumulatively amount to life-or-death decisions, have had an enormous im­
pact on the direction of human evolution. Degree of maternal commitment
was itself a selection pressure impinging on each newborn. W hat, then, were
the evolutionary consequences on the bodies, minds, and temperaments of
human infants?

W
                hen people imagine Charles Darwin, they think of the fresh­
                faced young naturalist who set out on the Beaole, or the balding,
                sideburned gentleman with bushy eyebrows who settled at
Down House to write The Ori9in if Species, The Descent if Man and Selection in
Relation to Sex, and The Expression cifthe Emotions in Man andAnimals, the works
that would make Charles Darwin, the bearded old man in a black cape, the
most influential biologist of all time. Few think of Darwin as a congenitally
sensitive little boy who lost his mother at an early age. But that's how John
Bowlby saw him. For Bowlby had this maternal habit of looking at the world
from a child's or an infant's point of view.
     Bowlby's last work, published posthumously in 1990 (the same year he
died), was a psychiatric case study entitled Charles Darwin: A New Life. He
toyed briefly with the notion of titling it The Origin cif Charles Darwin.1 For the
mother in me, the image of Darwin as vulnerable child is perhaps even more
meaningful than the superb intellectual biographies that also exist. 2 Bowlby
traced Darwin's lifelong illness and his peculiarly humble and dogged style of
doing science to early maternal deprivation. 1
     Darwin on John Bowlby's Couch
As Bowlby saw it, the nineteenth-century father of human ethology as well as
eYolutionary psychology, and the first naturalist in the world to apply etho­
logical methods to a detailed study of infant development, was startlingly,
poignantly, out of touch with the early development of his own emotions.
"Throughout his scientific career, unbelievably fruitful and distinguished
though it would be," wrote Bowlby, "Charles's ever-present fear of criticism,
both from himself and from others, and never satisfied craving for reassur-
                                          '

ance, seep through.      . . Unflagging industry and a horror of idleness were to
dominate his life.'>4 Bowlby traced a mystifying array of psychological and
bodily symptoms to Darwin's ruptured attachment and insecurities in child­
hood.5
    This was Bowlby's take on Darwin's lifelong insecurities, anxiety, depres­
sion, chronic headaches, fainting sensations, dizziness, "swimming head,"
"black dots," hysterical crying fits, ringing in the ears, itching, eczema, nau­
sea, and vomiting-all the ills that plagued Darwin for much of his adult life,
what Darwin himself would sum up as "One long struggle against the weari­
ness and strain of sickness."6
    There is no dearth of alternative hypotheses to explain the hodgepodge of
symptoms famously known as"Darwin's illness." Some years before Bowlby's
diagnosis, an Israeli parasitologist had suggested that Darwin contracted Cha­
gas' disease, caused by a blood parasite, while traveling in South America as a
young man. A historian suggested that a weak immune system left Darwin
susceptible to allergic reactions to the preservatives in which he stored his
specimens. Psychiatrist Ralph Colp, in a very detailed examination of the
timing of the onset of Darwin's symptoms, argued that they resulted from
Darwin's anxiety at the prospect of challenging his society's most deeply
cherished convictions. Some have even suggested Darwin's problems might
have been psychosomatic symptoms exploited by a confessed workaholic to
avoid tiresome social obligations. 7 Enviously, I have on occasion wondered
just how much this shy, serious country gentleman actually minded being
"forced to live . . . very quietly . . . able to see scarcely anybody and cannot
talk long with my nearest rclations"?8
    Bowlby Examines Darwin's Childhood
Darwin was an impressionable, innately sensitive eight-year-old when his
mother died. Not permitted to grieve in ways that would help him cope with
his feelings of abandonment and despair at the disappearance of this beloved
figure, Darwin became susceptible to what Bowlby termed"hyper ventilation
syndrome," an old-fashioned diagnosis doctors now subsume under the more
general diagnosis of"panic disorder."9
    My mother died in July 1 8 1 7, when I was a little over eight years old,
    and it is odd that I can remember hardly anything about her except her
    death-bed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed work-

     table. I believe that my forgetfulness is partly due to my sisters, owing
     to their great grief, never being able to speak about her or to mention
     her name.11
     As far as is known, neither Charles nor anyone else in the Darwin family,
not father or sisters, ever mentioned his mother again. In his autobiography,
Darwin simply recounts that shortly afterward, he was sent away to school.
Thereafter, Darwin's relationship with his mother was replaced by less satis-
                                        '

fying substitutes. H e was lorded over by an intimidating father and scolded by
moralistic sisters bent on making him a"better" person at the expense of his
own inclinations.
    Years later, in what Bowlby seized upon as a crucial clue for his diagnosis,
Darwin wrote to a cousin who had just lost his young wife:"Never in my life
having lost one near relation, I daresay I cannot imagine how severe grief such
                                                   . . " arguably a gemus,

                                                                             not
to be able to"imagine" a loss such as he had actually suffered-well, frankly,
Bowlby has a point. This does seem odd.
    From an early age Darwin felt browbeaten by his overly allomaternal sis­
ters, and when their admonitions distressed him, he"made himself dogged so
as not to care."13 To his anxiety, at the prospect of lost affection, and other
internalized self-doubts (which spilled over into Darwin's science in mar­
velous ways, eliciting in him a healthy respect for facts that did not conform
to his theories), was added this extraordinary perseverance and propensity to
rescue his sense of self-worth through fastidious labor. "It's dogged as does
it"-a common phrase of the time (used byTrollope as a chapter title in his
novel Barchester Towers) became Darwin's favorite motto.
    Avoiding what distressed him most, Darwin equipped himself to explore a
different set of dangerous ideas. Yet he continued to suffer odd lapses. Bowlby
was particularly struck by an anecdote recalled by Darwin's granddaughter,
Gwen Darwin Raverat , who used to play word games with her grandfather at
Down House.
   "The Letter Game: Word making and word taking" was an old Darwin
family staple, not unlike Scrabble. The object, recalls Raverat in her spirited
memoir, Period Piece, was to arrange separate letters into any word in the dic­
tionary by stealing a letter and adding it to another word already in play. Rav­
erat recounts her grandfather's consternation one day when a fellow player
added an "M" to the word "OTHER": Darwin looked at it for a long time,
unable to recognize it as a word:
    There was the story of my grandfather (C. D.) who, on seeing the word
    MOTHER on the board, looked at it for a long time, and then said
   "MOETHER; there's no word MOETHER." I feel that the Psycholo­
    gists might get a great deal of fun out of this anecdote-! beg their
    pardons, I don't mean fun, but Important Information; clues to the
                            HORN      TO    ATTACH
    conception of The Origin cif Species on the one hand, or to his ill health
    [which) could doubtless he proved by this story to he the direct conse­
    quences of the cady death of his own MOETHER."14
His granddaughter's lighthearted interpretation of Darwin's lapse apparently
stimulated Bowlby's more serious diagnosis of maternal deprivation.
    From his own childhood, Bowlby was all too familiar with the distant rela­
tionships typical in well-off British families, and focused on this aspect of
Darwin's childhood. Bowlby hypothesized that Darwin's early loss and sup­
pressed recollections of it contributed to his lifelong vulnerability to anxiety
and to his fear of losing anyone's affection or of physical loss of anyone he
cared for.
    Had Darwin himself set out to analyze this painful terrain, to try to under­
stand the tactics that immature humans use to avoid being abandoned and to
cope with varying degrees of maternal deprivation, even so creative a mind as
his own would not have been intellectually prepared for the journey. For one
thing, Darwin was not prepared to imagine the mother as a multifaceted
strategist. This constrained his ability to think about the full range of selection
pressures that would have acted upon infants in the evolutionary past. The
first step toward a broader understanding of the psychology of babies was
taken by Bowlby, who set himself the task of reconstructing what it would
take for a baby in the Pleistocene to be among those that survived long
enough to grow up. Bowlby was the first to really usc Darwin's theory of nat­
ural selection to explain infant emotions.
    Connoisseurs of Mothering
Bowlby proposed that all primates arc born prcprogrammed to form a pow­
erful emotional attachment to their mother or other primary attachment
figure to whom the infant strove to stay close at all times. Early in life, he
believed, infants form an "internal working model" about what to seck and
expect from relationships, based largely on the extent to which their own
early feelings arc reciprocated.
    Darwin and other early pioneers of human ethology had hinted at infant
motivations, but Bowlby was the first to characterize infants as both highly
vulnerable and precociously social actors with their own agendas for ensuring
continued protection and access to the nurture necessary for survival. This
                                         '
                        AN    INFANT       S-EYE     VIEW
way of conceptualizing infant development became known as "attachment
theory." By the end of the twentieth century, Bowlby's insights would be
revised, expanded, and incorporated into the new view of mothers then
emerging as scientists explored the full range of selection pressures acting on
these little monitors of maternal commitment.
    For in Mother Nature's great gallery of creations, human infants are both
masterpieces and connoisseurs-connoisseurs of mothering. Embryos evalu­
ate a mother's chemistry and have already begun to register her utterances.
Infants memorize her scent and assess her glances, her warmth, her tone of
voice. Above all, infants are exquisitely sensitive to signals of maternal com­
mitment. Will she stay close or (most dreaded prospect!) disappear?
    If human mothers were automatically nurturing, their infants would not
need to be so attuned and keenly discriminating. Although this is not the
part of the story that Bowlby stressed, the connoisseurship of infants is the
strongest evidence there is for how contingent maternal commitment has
been through the environments of greatest evolutionary relevance in respect
to such traits. For in the course of human evolution their increasingly slip­
pery and hairless mothers had become more fertile than any ape ever before,
with consequences for how unconditionally loving a human mother could
afford to be.
    If a baby finds a rubber pacifier soothing it is because for at least fifty mil­
lion y ears, primate infants so engaged could feel secure, because a baby suck­
ing on a nipple is a baby likely to have a mother close at hand. A taste of
sugar-water in its mouth produces even more sustained calm, 15 because for a
mammal such sweetness is associated with mother's milk. More subtly, as
Darwin remarked, each touch, intonation, and expression, as well as how
long it takes the mother to respond to signals of distress, contribute to an
accumulating internal dossier on her "thoughts and intentions."
    Even Bowlby, however, continued to think of a mother and a securely
attached infant as one harmonious unit. Attachment theory developed inde­
pendently of revolutionary changes in Darwinian thinking introduced by
Hamilton (on kin selection) and Trivers (on the potential for conflict
between maternal and infant interests). In the past decade, these ideas have
forced geneticists and developmental psy chologists alike to reassess the ten­
sions inherent in this close, interdependent relationship involving two
genetically nonidentical, divergently self-interested partners: mother and
offspring.
                            HORN     TO   ATTACH
    Harmonious But Also Discordant Interests
By the 199os, evolutionary biologist David Haig was projecting Trivers's
counterintuitive analysis of"mother-offspring conflict" back in developmen­
tal time. Haig called attention to the invasion of maternal tissue by the fetal
placenta, whose secretions begin to mimic the mother's own hormonal mes­
sages to herself, usurping c ontrol over certain features of her physiology.
No longer necessarily assuming a harmonious intimacy between mother and
developing embryo, Haig's view transformed gestation into a complicated
"tug-of-war" over maternal resources.
    Gestation, a host of complex transactions across the placenta, would come
to be viewed as a high-stakes physiological game as mother and embryo
maneU\·er for advantageous shares of her bodily resources. But this is a game
with specific boundaries: if her potential losses rise too high, the mother bails
out; the infant wins only if the mother is still playing at birth and through
the period of infant dependency. These newborns emerge immobile, unable
to forage or regulate their own temperatures, defenseless and exposed
to diverse dangers. Nonhuman primate infants can at least cling; human
babies-born developmentally so early that some anthropologists refer to
them as"exterogestate fetuses"-can't even do that.
    Once evolutionary theorists began to elucidate the innate conflicts of
interest between a mother and the rapidly growing fetus within her, between
an infant who desires to nurse longer and a mother who is ready to wean it,
all the physiologically inefficient and sometimes noisy Sturm und Drang of
Mother Nature's nursery takes on new dimensions. "Of course!" we exclaim
in hindsight. Of course human infants are born connoisseurs: over genera­
tions, those that were not so savvy were more likely to miss cues critical for
survival in an already hostile world.
    In the human case, the costs of rearing infants (and then children) go
on and on, long past weaning, even though members of the genus Homo pur­
suing novel lifestyles had become more fertile than any ape ever before.
Meanwhile women were giving birth after shorter-than-ever-before inter­
vals, fast-arriving primate newborns had not only to fear unwanted atten­
tions from unrelated intruders (as other primates do) but also to become
sensitized and evolve so as to dread (and if possible counteract) any hint of
reluctance to commit on the part of a mother whose ministrations right after
birth are all too desperately needed.
    From an infant's perspective, what arc the evolutionary consequences of
                                         '
390                     AN INFANT S-EYE             VIEW
contingent maternal love? Should it surprise us that across all 1 7 !i species of
primates, none rivals the psychological sophistication and plump pulchritude
of the human neonate? Parental preferences have produced runaway selection
for their allure.
    An infant's basic survival instructions include not just attaching to mother
but appealing to her. At the slightest hint of ambivalence, baby hominids go
into overtime, bent on keeping the engine of maternal commitment chug­
ging away at full throttle. Yet even if she fails them-and this is the truly
amazing part-human infants appear to be equipped with a few contingency
plans of their own.
    Over tens of thousands of years, in worlds where infant survival often
depends upon maternal calculations, tradeoffs, choices, and prioritizing, an
infant had to be appealing in order to extract more rather than less care from
his mother, or in extreme cases to be cared for at all. 16 Maternal ambivalence
and infantile allure are scarcely areas where many of us expect (and even
fewer of us ever want) to find natural selection callously about her work. But
diverse strands of evidence lead to the unavoidable, if disturbing, conclusion
that natural selection has indeed operated in this realm. At no time has
Mother Nature been more persistently about her "bad habits" than in the
recent past of Homo sapiens.
    There are many reasons why human immatures are vulnerable. But I have
become convinced that in worlds before birth control, a mother's assessment
of her infant's prospects to survive, grow up, and find a niche first in the fam­
ily and then in the world has to be counted among the primary factors affect­
ing infant survival.
    If, from a mother's point of view, deciding to suckle any one child means
sacrificing some other option (usually the option to conceive again in the near
future), if being pro-life always necessitates a choice, then survival from a
human infant's point of view meant being born sufficiently attractive to its
mother to lure her into the first, largest, step toward lifelong commitment:
the establishment of lactation. From ovulation to conception to birth, the
mother's germ line (or hereditary material) embarks on a perilous odyssey,
fraught with staggering wastage. By the end of this section on why infants arc
the way they arc, it should be clear why nature's real heroes and heroines arc
the eggs, the embryos, the infants who against staggering odds survived at all.
                            BORN     TO ATTACH                                39'
Maternal ambivalence is treated today as if it were a deep secret only just
being unveiled, with a rush of brave new publications in both fiction and psy­
choanalysis re,·caling "the maternal heart of darkness, a territory all mothers
and clinicians know, but few discuss."17 But this new post-Bowlby way of
thinking about mothers and offspring, applying an evolutionary perspective
to both their discordant and common interests, alters our initial expecta­
tions. It leaves many mothers-myself included-wondering how any one of
us could have been so naive as to ever envision the mother-inE:mt dyad in the
idealized glow of harmonious unity.
    Far from being surprised or shocked, we should be asking ourselves how
we failed to expect these ambivalent emotions in their every nuance. There
are good reasons why infant demands sometimes seem so insatiable, and there
arc equally good reasons why mothers sometimes find such ser vitude over­
whelming and resist them . There are also sound evolutionary reasons why
such tensions would have an important impact on the developing child's view
of the other people in his or her world. For what Bowlby termed the baby's
"internal working model" of relationships would in fact constitute the best
predictor any developing human could have about what to expect. The inter­
nal working model is more nearly a working hypothesis about how much sup­
port from mother and other kin will be forthcoming, and to what degree.
    When a Human's Life Begins
If, as David Haig argues, this tug-of-war begins at the moment of conception,
then from the perspective of a precivilized mother, abortion and infanticide
are equivalent, except that in earlier times the former (abortion) was riskier
for the mother, whereas today birth followed by infanticide is. There are cer­
tainly many important legal and ethical distinctions to be observed here, but
none that Mother Nature would take note of. This haunting realization raises
unescapable ethical dilemmas for those committed to a woman's (legal) right
to choose how, when , and whether she'll sign over part of her existence to
another being, as well as for those who take seriously a child's need to be
born wanted by someone prepared to care for it.
     If we are to rescue from mysticism the debate over reproductive rights,
we cannot ignore these issues. If we accept that the fetus is a dependent
organism that happens also to have its own agenda, at what point in the
process of gestation can we honestly declare that the life of an in<lividual has
still not begun? Hmv can it be legal to buy, sell, or inherit embryos (as it is in
 392                                     '
                        AN INFANT S-EYE             VIEW
many states in the United States) but not babies? On what grounds do
humans accord the mother's interests priority over those of her fetus? "Equal
Rights for Unborn Women" reads the slogan on an anti -choice T-shirt. What
to do about seemingly irreconcilable moralities: the rights of the unborn ver­
sus the bondage of the horn? If human DNA is 98 percent identical to that of
a chimp or a honoho, what is it that makes the information encoded in this
DNA human rather than ape? What is responsible for the transformation of
the potential encoded in human DNA into a being with the unique cognitive
and emotional capacities that make us "human" and distinguish us from all
other animals? Scientists estimate that a mere so or so genes-out of the vast
number of genes that chimpanzees and humans share in common-account
for the cognitive differences between the two species; that fractional genomic
disparity combined with differences in several regulatory genes that control
                                                        18
the timing of gene expression make all the difference.
    In particular it is attributes like language-as George Eliot and her
common-law husband, the nineteenth-century evolutionary psychologist
George Henry Lewes, pointed out long ago-that allow "the mother to
transform a maternal instinct into a maternal sentiment." Language is inte­
gral to the symbolic capacity that allows humans to understand cognitively
what others are expressing at the same time as we understand at an emotional
level what others are feeling. It is because "a human mother can appreciate the
claims of offspring in general, not just her own" that a woman "can have an
emotional appreciation of the claims of the helpless which is denied a
baboon," Lewes wrote . 19
    What makes us humans rather than just apes is this capacity to combine
intelligence with articulate empathy. But all humans develop this empathetic
component in the first months and years of life as part of a unit that involves
at least one other person. This is what the psychoanalyst and pediatrician
D. W Winnicott meant when he said, "There is no such thing as a [human J
baby; there is a baby and someone." No matter how sophisticated the in vitro
technology, or even the capacity to clone one human organism from another,
the DNA of Homo sapiens docs not develop these uniquely human capacities
without the intervention of other humans, sustained interactions between a
genetically engineered baby and its interacting caretakers.
    To he distinctively human-different from, say, a genetically very similar
chimpanzee-is to develop this unique empathetic component that is the
foundation of all morality. Such unique capacities do not, cannot, develop in a
                           BORN     TO ATTACH                             393
social vacuum. In chapter 2 3 ("Alternate Paths of Development") I will spec­
ulate on just how and why this quota of compassion for others unfolds as it
does, and why I believe so strongly that to be pro-life, meaning in favor of
human life, means being pro-choice.
   But I am getting ahead of my story, which begins with Darwin and his
biographer-analyst John Bowlby, who set out to investigate exactly why it is
so important for human immatures to feel securely attached , and ends with
my speculations as to why receiving signs of commitment from others is
essential for developing uniquely human capacities.

            scale. Bowlby's focus was the infant's perception of his or her inter­
personal world.
      Bowlby's classic trilogy on attachment and loss-Attachment (I 969) ; Sepa­
ration:Anxiety and Anaer (I 973); and Loss (I 98o )-sought to explain the evolu­
tionary origins of the emotional attachment that humans forge with mothers,
and allomothers. One goal was to explain the desperation, rage, and despair
experienced when these attachments are ruptured.
      Producing "AttachmentTheory"
If the field of evolutionary psychology is in any sense the revolutionary "new
science" touted on the cover of magazines, 1 and not just sociobiology-by­

began with Bowlby, four decades earlier. Through Bowlby, significant por­
tions of psychoanalysis, and eventually psychology, were , in his words,
"recast . .. in terms of evolutionary theory" and brought in from the cold,
where they had previously been left out "beyond the fringe of the scientific
world."2

Just before the outbreak of World War II, Bowlby went to work as a psychia­
trist at a center for troubled youngsters in London. He was struck by the
blank emotional responses of some of the delinquents assigned to him for
treatment.Many of them shared a common developmental history. Either
they had been physically separated from their mothers while young, or some­
thing prevented them from forming a close attachment to them . Bowlby's
admittedly subjective observations became the centerpiece for his early
paper "Forty-four Juvenile Thieves: Their Characters and Home-life," which
was published just after war's end.
    Bowlby was already thinking about mother-infant separation as a source
of developmental disturbance even before he had an opportunity to view fel­
low psychoanalyst Rene Spitz's documentary film chronicling the lives of
children in a Mexican foundling home titled "Grief: A Peril in Infancy."
Spitz's aim was to capture the emotional distress, anger, and resentment, fol­
lowed by self-protective emotional disengagement, of infants coping with
abandonment.As an all-pervasive gloom settled over the little form in the
crib, a formerly cheerful (preseparation) toddler was transformed into a
"frozen," "passive," and "apathetic" automaton, often leaving war-sensitized
viewers with the mistaken impression that they had just seen a film about
concentration camp victims rather than children in an ostensibly benevolent
institution.
    Spitz's goal was emotional impact . This aim took precedence over scien­
tific methodology.  The main message of his black-and-white silent film could
be summarized by one of the title cards flashed on the screen: "The cure: Give
mother back to baby."3 As a result, both the film and Spitz's subsequent papers
(published in 1945" and 1946) were savaged by critics who pointed to inex­
plicably fluctuating sample sizes and to sources of bias, especially the fact that
Spitz's study subjects had been available throughout for adoption so that the
healthiest among them might have been skimmed off, leaving only the most
damaged children for Spitz to study. The then president of the New York State
Psychological Association described these attacks on Spitz's reputation as "a
kind of hydrogen bomb ... of destructive criticism; not a paragraph is left
standing for miles around. »
                           ' But this firestorm did not alter the impact of his
film: it touched the consciences of institutional administrators throughout

the Western world, and it solidified young Bowlby's conviction that his
hunches were well founded.
By associating himself with Melanic Klein, a pioneer in the psychoanalysis of
children, Bowlby entered "the only discipline [then] committed to the sys­
tematic study of emotions and relationships."5 At that time it was essentially
either Freudian psychoanalysis or nothing. Early on Bowlby, like Klein,
accepted Freud's notion that the child's early relationship with the mother
becomes a template for future relationships.But he grew increasingly frus­
trated with this focus on interior, imagined worlds.
    When Bowlby saw a disturbed and hyperactive boy and an even more
emotionally disturbed mother, he felt certain that the boy's difficulties had
something to do with their relationship; but talking to (let alone attempting
to treat) the mother was off-limits.For Bowlby, ambivalent, remote, negli­
gent, or abusive parents were not necessarily imagined; some were all too
real.Yet as a psychoanalyst, his job was to work through the child's fantasies.
"I held the view that real-life events-the way parents treat a child-is of key
importance in determining development, and Melanie Klein would have
none of it. The object relations she was talking about were entirely internal
relationships." The disapprobation was mutual.With regard to Bowlby, Anna
Freud simply shook her head and said: "As analysts ... we do not deal with
happenings in the external world as such but with their repercussions in the
mind."6
    Bowlby Looks to the Animals
From the outset, Bowlby was attracted to the fledgling field of ethology then
emerging in Europe, where researchers Konrad Lorenz in Austria and Niko
Tinbergen in Holland were determined to observe their animal subjects in
natural environments-the real world. At the time, however, there were no
bridges between psychologists studying humans and animal behaviorists. "I
badly needed a guide," Bowlby recalled. 7
    In r 9 54, at a meeting in London of a Study Group on the Psychobiological
Development of the Child, convened by the World Health Organization,
Bowlby and a young ethologist from Cambridge University named Robert
Hinde found themselves as the "second string" stand-ins for Lorenz and Tin-

chaffinches, coots, and great tits, had been trained to search for both the
immediate physiological causes as well as the ultimate, evolutionary causes of
anima) behavior. But his connections with psychology predisposed him to
consider humans as we11. In this bird man, Bowlby found his "guide"-a guide
not only to thinking about mothers and infants in terms of what was going on
in their real world, but also with consideration to what went on in past
worlds, where the ancestors of these infants had also needed to survive.

                       AN     INFANT       S-EYE    VIEW
Bowlby returned the favor by drawing Hinde into the study of primate, and
eventually human, relationships. 8
    Where Does the Need to Attach Come From?
At the time, Freud and his followers, as well as the behaviorist school in
America, all assumed that "The reason why the infant in arms wants to per­
ceive the presence of its mother is only because it already knows by experi­
ence that she satisfies all its needs without delay . . ." They assumed the
infant was conditioned by the mother's satisfaction of its "need for nourish­
ment." But now it appeared that the infant's need for contact with a familiar
figure was something quite separate from hunger. The"cupboard love" theory
left a great deal about an infant's love for his mother unexplained.9
    Hinde alerted Bowlby to the bizarre experiments on "mother love" that
Harry Harlow was doing at the University of Wisconsin. Harlow would pro­
vide infant rhesus macaques a choice between terrycloth-covered but nipple­
less "mother-surrogates" that permitted infants to cling to a warm, soft
surface, or similarly configured dolls made of bare wire but equipped with
milk bottles. The baby monkeys spent only as much time on the wire mothers
as was necessary to feed before scrambling back to the comfort of the soft
surrogates, where they felt more secure. Clinging to a surrogate mother had
everything to do with this notion of"security" and little to do with satisfying
hunger.
    So powerful was the baby's urge to cling to a familiar figure, even an"abu­
sive" surrogate mother was preferable to being detached. When Harlow pre­
sented baby macaques with mechanically devised spike-sprouting surrogates
or mothers that suddenly puffed blasts of air, the infants gripped all the
tighter to the only security they knew. About the only mother perceived by
infants as worse than no mother was the refrigerated model Harlow engi­
neered to be literally cold as icc; the tortured infant assigned to her huddled
                             10
despairingly in the corner.
    Harlow's worst-case scenarios revealed baby monkeys desperately seeking
security from the closest thing to a mother they could locate. Bowlby's mind
was now alive to the possibilities of experiments with more normally reared
infant monkeys. Would infants separated from their mothers respond with the
same sequence of protest and despair that had hccn observed in hospitalized
human infants? From this followed the next, bigger, question: Would mater­
nal deprivation in infancy have effects detectable later in the monkey's life?

     Effects of Separation in Other
    Primates
The goal was to determine under con­
trolled experimental conditions whether
periods of separation from the mother
during infancy had long-term effects on
how secure or confident that individual felt. Like infant humans, all monkey
and ape babies seek, in Bowlby's words, "secure attachment to a trusted fig­
ure" during the first months of life. Only in the most primitive-seeming sur­
vi,·ing prosimians-such as bush babies (galagos), ruffed lemurs, or the
saucer-eyed nocturnal aye-ayes, who give birth to multiple young and leave
them in nests-are baby primates ever out of direct, tactile, body-to-body
contact with a caretaker. In all other primates, infants arc carried everywhere

    mothers or allomothers.
    Experiments with rhesus monkeys undertaken by Hinde at Cambridge
Unh·ersity showed that infant monkeys whose mothers were temporarily
removed (so that the infants themselves were left in the same environment
but deprived of this contact) sequentially exhibit "protest," "despair," and
finally "detachment" as the infant begins to reorganize its behavior in light of
its loss of security. 12 Monkeys in the wild act the same when separated from
their mothers. An infant langur temporarily separated from its mother may
climb high in a tree and make high-pitched birdlike calls. (Mothers, too, call
piteously, and for hours-the unpublished side of the macaque studies.)
Whate,·er was going on in the attachment of human babies to their mothers,
the origin of such emotions went far back in time, as do the emotions of
human obseners who find these cries heartrending.
A number of experiments were done in which five- to six-month-old rhesus
macaques were separated from their mothers for either one six-day period,
two such periods, or one long thirteen-day period. In some experiments
                                       '
400                    AN    INFANT S-EYE VIEW
(code-named "Mother Goes to Hospital"), the mother was removed from the
cage, while the infant remained with other group mates. In spite of the com­
pany, the baby monkey immediately missed the mother, looked everywhere,
puckered its lips into plaintive whoo-calls, and ceased playing. The infant
gradually sank into a motionless apathy that few would hesitate to call
"despair."The longer the absence, the more depressed the infant became, and
the longer recovery took when its mother was returned. Infants who suffered
multiple separations had more pronounced, longer-term effects than those
separated only once. 13
    When mothers were returned, infants clung yet more tightly. Many
regressed in behavior, acting younger than they really were. Although "too
old" for such behavior, the babies spent more time clinging to the mother
than before the separation. Reluctant to leave the mother to explore, the
reunited infants succumbed to violent temper tantrums if the mother moved
away.
    Just how distressed the infant was after separation depended in part on
how secure the infant's relationship with mother had been before. The more
the mother had been trying to separate herself from the infant (that is, if she
had been at all rejecting before the experiment), or to the extent that the
infant had any reason to feel insecure about her commitment beforehand,
the removal of the mother was that much more distressing. Compared with
secure infants, insecure ones given a "second chance" on the mother's return
clung all the more desperately.
   Twelve months later, infants separated from their mothers for either one
or two six-day periods were compared with control infants that had remained
continuously with their mothers. The separated infants explored less and
played less. The most striking difference emerged when infants confronted
anything novel. Two-year-old monkeys tend to be insatiably curious. Yet, the
more reason the infant had to feel insecure, the more hesitant it was to
explore even something as innocuous as a banana left in the adjoining cage.
More than two years after the original experiment, infants who had been sep­
arated from their mothers remained more timid than infants whose mothers
had not been removed. 14
    Separated infants also exhibited measurable physiological changes in sleep
patterns and heart rates .. Hormones like cortisol, produced by the body in
response to physical and psychosocial stress, were secreted at higher levels as
                    MEETING       THE    EYES     OF   LOVE
infants mobilized bodily resources to cope with the impending challenges of
an "orphaned" situation. As less invasive procedures (analyzing samples of
saliva rather than blood) became available, similar responses were recorded
for humans; separated babies had elevated cortisol levels and their hearts beat
faster. 15
    From these experiments it was obvious that the infant's relationship with
its mother (whether the infant was securely attached to her before separa­
tion) affects how the infant responds to brief separations and the ensuing
reunification. Such studies make it possible to observe how secure versus
insecurely attached infants react . But something else was needed.
    Ainsworth's "Strange Situation Test"
Like Darwin's theory of natural selection, Bowlby's theory of attachment was
one of those grand explanatory schemes evoking a mystical allegiance from
adherents. Decades before anyone had solid evidence that natural selection
actually occurred in the wild, Darwin's hypothesis attracted ardent support
as well as criticism. So with attachment theory. Bowlby, his coworkers, and
their followers fer vently believed in the importance of secure attachment for
subsequent development, but scientifically they were hamstrung. To measure
an emotion like love, to measure attachment, was like trying to apply a ruler
to a wave.16
    What finally brought attachment theory firmly into the realm of scientific
study was a deceptively simple twenty-minute procedure called the "strange
situation test." Invented by Bowlby's associate Mary Ainsworth, this ingenious
procedure could be done under controlled conditions in a lab no more elabo­
rate than a room with some toys, which made it possible to classify particular
qualities of the relationship between infant and mother.
    During research on infants growing up in rural villages in Uganda, Mary
Ainsworth meticulously recorded the newborns' progression from undis­
criminating acceptance of anyone who holds and comforts them to differen­
tial responsiveness, in which infants begin to prefer the familiar figures (not
necessarily the mother) who comfort them most often. Since the mother was
often the main caretaker, Ainsworth observed a highly differentiated prefer­
ence for this most trusted person during a period when the infant typically
cries if mother leaves and exults in her return. Infants not only protest when
mother leaves, but actively take the initiative, purposefully crawling after her.
                                       '
402                    AN    INFANT S-EYE           VIEW
Near the end of this phase, around six to eight months, uneasiness at the
appearance of strangers intensifies. This was the knowledge that Ainsworth
employed to begin classifying attachment. 17
    After her return from Africa, while continuing her research at Johns Hop­
kins, Mary Ainsworth came up with the exact protocol of the now widely uti­
lized "strange situation" procedure. According to prearranged plan, mother
and infant arrive together in the lab; shortly thereafter the mother slips
out, leaving her infant alone in an unfamiliar setting with a kindly disposed
stranger. Then the mother returns. This process is repeated. Exactly what
the infant does (or does not do) to reestablish physical and psychological con­
tact with her mother after these absences is carefully observed, coded, and
classified.
    Virtually any normally reared primate infant, whether monkey or human,
separated for a period from its mother, responds to her return by rushing up
to her, jumping aboard, and holding tight. If the relationship with mother
before the separation had been a bit tense (if, for example, a mother had dis­
appeared on a previous occasion, or if the mother had begun to reject the
infant as a part of weaning), the insecure infant would cling all the more
tightly upon her return. 18 If a human infant feels very secure, he may scarcely
notice his mother's absence, and continue to play and explore. Upon her
return he merely looks up, a smile lighting his face, glad to sec her-but not
obviously relieved because he had not been worried. Whether easygoing or
more stressed, six-month-old monkeys or two-year-old toddlers obviously
derived comfort from their mothers. Mary Ainsworth assumed that all
human infants were going to feel this way.
Probably no one was more surprised by the results of the first systematic
applications of her "strange situation" procedure to humans than Ainsworth
herself. As anticipated, the majority of human infants acted like baby
macaques; they were distressed by the mother's absence, rushed to her on her
return, and were comforted. But not all the toddlers acted this way. Some
infants seemed wary and distressed even before separation from the mother.
They were preoccupied by their mothers before as well as after, and failed to
be comforted by her on her return. Others refused to look at her. Some actu-

    These infants were classified as insecurely attached to their mothers. The
insecure infants were divided into two categories: the first were "in­
secure/ ambivalent" about their relationship to their mother. They focused on
their mother but seemed hesitant to trust her, and were distressed when she
left but not necessarily comforted by her return. In the second category were
the "insecure/avoidant.""Avoidant" toddlers failed to show distress on sepa­
ration and-against expectation-actually sought to elude their mother on
her return. Researchers noticed that the mothers of these "insecure/
avoidant" infants seemed negative and even rejecting in their treatment of
their infant. 20 When observed at home, avoidantly attached human infants
actually exhibited the sort of anger that simmers quietly until suddenly,
seemingly unprovoked, the infant strikes out at the mother.
    When the Primary Attachment Figure
     Is HerselfFrightening
A subset of infants could never be classified. This led Ainswor th's former stu­
dent Mary Main, a professor of psychology at the University of California at
                                         1
                        AN   INFANT        S-EYE    VIEW
Berkeley, to reexamine these anomalous cases. A third category of "inse­
curely attached" infants that Main and coworkers termed "disorganized/ dis­
oriented" was identified.21 When the mother returned after separation, the
"disorganized" infants seemed confused, both seeking the mother and avoid­
ing her. The attachment figure is "the primate infant's haven of safety in times
of alarm," wrote Mary Main. For this reason the infant who is frightened
by an attachment figure "should experience simultaneous tendencies to
approach and take flight. Conditions of this kind present an attached infant
with a paradox that cannot be resolved in behavioral terms." Together with
Erik Hesse, Main hypothesized that infants repeatedly exposed to frightening
behavior by their caretaker, or else to caretakers who themselves seemed
frightened, were presented with an irresolvable dilemma. As a result, the
infant was unable to marshal any coherent strategy. 22
    Ghosts in the Nursery
Ainsworth's "strange situation" procedure made it possible to classify and
measure security of attachment. Researchers could replicate each other's
findings and also document correlations between patterns of attachment and
different physiological responses. Longitudinal obser vations (studies made
over a long time) have now made it possible to compare early attachment
classifications with subsequent performance of the same individual in school,
and with assessments of particular personality features in the same individual
made later in life. Ainsworth's "strange situation" procedure has been re­
peated now in literally hundreds of studies around the world. Generally
speaking, securely attached infants tend to be more socially secure at the time
they enter preschool , and to respond better to instructions from teachers,
than children who have been classified as insecure and disorganized in their
attachment to a key caretaker. 13
    The little girl who avoided her mother's ga:ze at age one was more likely to
turn a deaf ear to her teacher at age six. Thus a child's treatment, even hy
those who do not know her history, has a tendency to repeat and reinforce
past experiences with other people in new situations. 24
    From Spitz's films and Bowlby's first book, attachment theory, and along
with it characterizations of infants as either "securely" or "insecurely" attached
to their mothers, has flowed into the mainstream of thought about children's
emotional needs. Bowlby's ideas about attachment had practical applications
                       MEETING              THE           EYES         OF       LOVE
Fig. 16.4 Some infants responded to the mother's return with confusion or apprehension. Some
would seem confused and put hands to mouth as shown here or bow their head and step back­
ward or generally appear fearful . Such children could not he classified within Ainsworth's tradi­
tional categories. Subsequently, Mary Main proposed assigning them to a new "disorganized/
disoriented" attachment status. (Drall'ma by 7: Rianry, courtes:r '![Mary Main)
and entered the mainstream long before they were scientifically substantiated
by Mary Ainsworth's "strange situation" procedure.
     Longitudinal studies of the same infants make Bowlby's early speculations
seem increasingly prophetic. In Attachment he had written: "the inheritance of
mental health and of ill health through family microculture is no less impor­
tant, and may well be far more important than is genetic inheritance."25 And,
more often than not, securely attached babies do grow into socially secure
schoolchildren who mature into adults who form stable attachments and rear
secure children, while insecure attachments breed more insecure attach­
ments.
    Transplanted back into psychoanalysis, Bowlby's scenario fell on newly
fertile Freudian soil. It yielded the vivid metaphor of a "ghost in the nursery."
By 197s, psychoanalyst Selma Fraiberg and her coworkers would declare:
    In every nursery there are ghosts. The intruders from [a family's] past
    have taken up residence in their nursery claiming rights of ownership.
    They have been present at the christening for two or more generations.
    While none has issued an invitation[,] the ghosts take up residence and
                                                                                       6
    conduct the rehearsal of the family tragedy from a tattered script. 2
     Empirical support for the "ghost" was not far behind. Mary Main devised
an interview that permitted researchers to assess, decades later, how adults
felt about their own attachment histories. She and her coworkers were find-
                                       '
                         AN  INFANT S-EYE           VIEW
ing that adults' recollections of their childhoods predicted how they would
relate to their own infants, even how they would talk to them. It was the
mother's manner that they particularly remembered, and subsequently reen­
acted with their own children. 27
    General patterns of attachment were proving consistent over time: inse­
cure infants were more likely to become insecure children, and hence likely
to become parents who produce insecure infants. These effects seemed to
track separately from inherited differences in temperament and personality
         8
traits. 2
    Styles of Mothering Writ Large
In ways not yet understood, "ghosts in the nursery" interact with inherited
temperament and local customs to generate regional differences in child­
rearing. Studies done in northern Germany record surprisingly high propor­
tions of avoidantly attached infants, while south German and Japanese babies
are generally secure. Even when insecurely attached, they rarely avoid their
mothers or exhibit indifference; rather, they resist by pushing their mothers
away. 29 Similarly, children reared communally in Israeli kibbutzim are almost
never classified as avoidantly attached, so long as they retain sustained contact
with their mothers.
    From the age of six weeks, kibbutz infants arc cared for in small commu­
nal groups, nine hours a day, six days a week. They were visited frequently by
their mothers, who came each day to feed and bathe their babies. Some of
these infants were in communal care during the day but slept at home at
night. Of those sleeping at home, So percent were classified according to the
Ainsworth procedure as securely attached. But of those spending the night
away from home, only 48 percent were. 10 Boarder babies were deposited in
large communal dormitories, where they were mixed in with all children
under twelve and attended by a couple of custodians. A child waking in the
night would probably not encounter anyone familiar enough to qualify for
what Eliot and Bowlby thought of as "the meeting eyes of love," the baby's pri­
mary reassurance that care will continue to be forthcoming. The message is
fairly clear: effects of communal rearing depended on both the quality of the
care itself and on the child's experiences within its own family, in his or her
quest for commitment from caretakers.
    Compared with Darwin's "dangerous idea," the evolutionary theory that
philosopher Daniel Dennett has termed "universal acid" because it cuts so
                    MEETING        THE    EYES   OF    LOVE
deeply into human conceits about our place in the universe, Bowlby's intel­
lectual acid was less corrosive. Yet for psychoanalysts, for feminists, and espe­
cially for any woman with ambitions, it burns very deeply indeed.
    Situating infant emotions in a tangible vmrld trivializes psychoanalytical
preoccupations with imagined, interior worlds. For infants, the world really
is a dangerous place. By situating the mother (or other primary caretaker) at
the center of each de,·cloping infant's universe, Bowlby's theory of attach­
ment stings most smartly where it pricks the conscience of every mother
who is aware of her infant's needs but who also aspires to a life beyond bond­
age to them.
    To this day, the sting of Bowlby's acid evokes in me the haunting words of
Anke Ehrhardt, a preeminent woman scientist, a woman every bit as impres­
sh·e for her warmth and grace as for the accomplishments that made her the
world's expert on children's development of gender identity. Over breakfast
at a scientific conference in Prague this extraordinarily nurturing woman
confided why she consciously decided never to have children. She said it was
because she "knew too much" about what they need.

         owlby sought to explain infant desires and fears in terms of past
         environments of evolutionary relevance. He recognized that the
         endocrinological, sensory, and cognitive makeup of infants were
composites of ancient dramas encompassing innumerable past lives. Any
ancestral ape that survived long enough to grow up and reproduce can be
assumed to have spent the first months of life in continuous ventro-ventral
(stomach-to-stomach, chest-to-breast) contact with its mother, and to have
been motivated to remain near to that mother for many months after. Separa­
tion from mother spelled disaster, a point Bowlby loved to make by citing
Belloc's poem about ill-fated "jim."1
   A wild chimp baby orphaned before age three does not survive, even if
adopted by a solicitous older sibling. Even after age five, losing a mother is a
serious, life-threatening liability for a wild ape. Vigor is severely jeopardized,
and loss of mother almost certainly produces a suite of costly coping re­
sponses like rocking, hair-pulling, self-clutching, reduction in time spent
playing, and long-term timidity. Human apes in a foraging context fared little
better. Of the Ache infants who lost their mothers prior to one year of age,
                         "
                           sECURE      FROM     WHAT?"
not one sunh·cd. 2 For pre-Neolithic, still-nomadic humans the minimum
age for close mother-infant contact must have been quite variable, depending
on local conditions. It is extremely unlikely, however, that an infant could
have been weaned earlier than two years without severely jeopardizing his or
her life chances. Younger than four years, the mother was still gambling. 3
    Little we have learned since runs counter to Bowlby's principal assump­
tion that during humankind's "Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness,"
infants remained in close contact with mothers. Nevertheless, ethnographic
e\·idence from foraging peoples such as the Aka and the Efe, plus new evi­
dence from other primates, suggests that fathers, and especially alloparents,
were more important alternatives to continuous one-on-one contact with the
mother than Bowlby had realized.
    vVhen it was safe to do so, or when she had little or no choice, a mother
delegated care to others. However, this does not mean that the infant calcu­
lates the tradeoffs involved the same way that the mother does. As psychoan­
alyst Rozsika Parker puts it, whenever "a mother and a child recollect their
                                                34
relationship, two separate narratives emerge.'
    From the infant's point of view, being close to its mother would always be
the infant's top priority, even if the mother might benefit from more dis­
tance. For one thing, the typically dilute, low-fat constitution of primate
mother's milk means that breast-fed babies had to suckle more-or-less con­
tinuously to feel satisfied, especially when, as in the case of nomadic mothers
with lean diets, mothers were just barely keeping up with infant demand. An
infant constantly on and off the breast, in turn, ensured widely spaced births,
a beneficial side effect from staying close. Beyond security and nutrition, con­
tinuous access to the mother's breast means that a mother's subsequent con­
ception is held at bay. Among other things, then, staying close to mother
protected the babe-at-breast from competing demands on the mother by
siblings not yet conceived and the threat that a mother who finds herself
pregnant will wean at once. One of the most serious challenges that
could confront an infant in a world where the alternatives to mother's milk
were neither digestible nor safe was for its mother's prolactin levels and other
oYulation-inhibitors to slip so low that she ovulates and conceives before her
current infant can be safely weaned. Yet under the newly settled living condi­
tions of the Neolithic this must have been a common occurrence. Babies eat­
ing solid foods sooner would have suckled less, communicating to mothers
                                        1

who were also eating more and walking less that her baby was no longer ben­
efiting from milk before this was really true. Premature conceptions pitted
the needs of an older infant against its younger sib's.
    Anything But Blank
Far from being a blank slate, a human infant is equipped with a number of
behavioral systems ready to be activated. These systems range from the
simpler "fixed action patterns" (clutching, grasping, rooting for the nipple)
to more sophisticated cognitive capacities that require dynamic feedback
from the environment and practice to learn. Although not entirely prepro­
grammed (like the Moro reflex, discussed earlier), these learning systems are
biased so that the relevant processes are activated by stimuli falling within
one or more broad ranges, terminated by stimuli falling within other broad
ranges, and strengthened or weakened by stimuli of yet other kinds. 5 And
what provides the critical stimuli for infant development to unfold? The
more-or-less continuous presence of a sympathetic and responsive caretaker.
Like Bowlby's Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness, his articulation
of "learning biases" has become integral to the vocabulary of evolutionary
psychologists. By now, Bowlby's ideas about the grooves Mother Nature
engraves on every baby's slate are themselves entrenched in the working
assumptions of cognitive psychologists. Infants, we now know, don't process
random stimuli but seek out and fixate on specific patterns, like the com­
ponents of a human face. They prefer curves (like cheeks or eyebrows) to
straight lines, strong contrasts of light and dark (like pupils surrounded by
the whites of eyes), and acute angles (the corners of eyes) to obtuse angles.
Infants arc captivated by movement within a frame (lips talking in a face).
"When you add up all these innate preferences," writes infant psychologist
Daniel Stern in his beguiling Diary cif a Baby, "they almost spell FACE."6
    Not just any old face, though. Newborns preferentially seek out faces with
humanlike configurations: two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. They distinguish
symmetrical "pretty" faces and look at such faces longer than at lopsided or
grotesque ones, and perhaps seek out faces that are feminine. Babies also look
longer at familiar faces, which most psychologists take to mean that infants
"prcf er" them. 7

    Head propped up on a pillow, a newborn turns at will. She lingers longest
facing in the direction of the pad her mother wore inside her bra, savoring
that smell in preference to the smell wafting from the other side, from a pad
worn by someone else. Infants arc especially attuned to melodious, high­
pitched voices that rhapsodize in "babycsc." By the third trimester of preg­
nancy, fetuses can and do hear through the womb; their hearts beat faster
when a tape of the mother's voice is played than if it is the voice of a stranger. 8
Not surprisingly, then, experimenters can demonstrate that within three days
after birth the neonate prefers mother's voice to that of a stranger. 9 The sight
of mother matters, but so docs the mother's affect, how she seems to feel
toward her baby. Infants confronted with a mother who is depressed (or a
mother instructed by experimenters to wear an immobile, emotionless
                           10
mask) find it unnerving.
    Nothing blank about this slate: human infants are predisposed to seek out
a familiar, feminine, person: a person likely to be its mother. W hen they find
her, even brand-new babies are prepared, during alert windows of opportu­
nity, to open communication by responding to and imitating caretakers.
    Animal and Human Predators
Identifying mother is a critical first step to attachment, but attachment for
what? To Bowlby, the moral of Belloc's ditty was made clear in the succeed­
ing lines: "And always keep a hold of Nurse I For fear of finding something
worse." In the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness Bowlby had in
mind, "worse" meant predators: possibly hyenas, but most likely big cats­
tigers and leopards in the Old World, jaguars and mountain lions in the New.
"Protection from predators is by far the most likely function of attachment
behaviour," wrote Bowlby.11 That attachment to mother keeps infant secure
from predators has been more or less the party line ever since. But let's
examine the idea further.
    There can be little doubt that any Pleistocene cat worth its paws would
indeed devour an unprotected immature. From South Asia (tigers) to South
America Uaguars) big cats still occasionally kill and eat grown men . Owing to
their small size and defenselessness, immatures would be especially vulnera­
ble. During one particularly bad year ( 1 878), British colonial officials in India
reported 6 24 humans-mostly children-kiJled by wolves. Grown-ups are
too big for wolves to take, and infants arc normally kept close for safety. But
the local practice of sleeping outside on stifling-hot summer nights permitted
                                                '

these wolves their chance: they would slip noiselessly into open-air bed­
rooms and make off with a young child.
      Every forest culture has its own version of Belloc's rhyme to terrify chil­
dren into staying close. All parties involved are either consciously aware of
the dangers, so that children rarely wander from camp on their own , or
innately predisposed (in the cases of toddlers) to stay near mothers.
      But were wild animals the only dangers? Worried about an influential
alternative hypothesis to explain an infant's attachment to his mother
 (namely, the idea that infants learn valuable social skills from her), Bowlby
posed additional questions for himself. W hy, he asked, "should attachment
behaviour persist into adult life, long after learning is complete?" and
"why . . . should it be especially persistent in females?"13 Both questions
could be satisfactorily explained by his anti-predator hypothesis. But so might
they also have been explained by a third possibility: the threat to infant pri­
 mates from unrelated males, predators of the same species. This possibility, if
it occurred to Bowlby at all (evidence for this phenomenon was still skimpy
during the years he was de,·cloping attachment theory), would have been dis­
 missed as an aberration, of no relevance in the EEA.

As documentation impro\·es over the twentieth century, records for nomadic
foraging societies, as well as for some more settled pre-Neolithic societies in
ancient Greece, show that children were intentionally targeted by steppar­
ents, marauders from other groups, and even by competing mothers. Such
practices did not necessarily end with the emergence of modern "civilization."
Millions of children died at proportionately far higher rates than adults in
episodes as disparate as the Stalin-induced famine in the Ukraine ( 19 29-33)
and Hitler's Holocaust. The point here is that whether in tribal raids or polit­
ically motivated genocide, children are the most defenseless and suffer the
highest mortality.
    Yet I believe it is true (wartime statistics aside) that in humans infanticide
by im·ading males is less common, and a less important source of mortality,
than in other primates, such as langurs, howler monkeys, gorillas, and chim­
panzees. One possibility is that as the threat of infanticide became a selection
pressure in its own right, greater paternal protection was selected for as well.
Hominid families may have become especially effective at protecting other­
wise defenseless immatures and mothers burdened by caring for them.
    Males inclined to stay close to their families so as to protect their offspring
had more infants sur vive. Not only did infanticide select for maternal coun­
terstrategies to forestall male aggression against infants (leaving their group;
mating with multiple males), but it may also have favored fathers inclined to
defend their progeny. Human families had to protect y oung from many types
of predator. Conspecifics, however, may have comprised the most worrisome
class of predator.14 Nor were kin and other group members, especially step­
fathers and cowives, necessarily excluded from this roster of potential killers.
The historical record provides its own dismal chronicle of pedicides, ranging
from the Empress Livia's plotting against Octavius's heirs to little English
princes strangled in the Tower.
    Rethinking "Fear of Strangers"
Even though we cannot know how rare or common infanticide by individuals
other than the mother might have been among our ancestors, the sheer
weight of accumulating evidence for infanticide by unrelated males is causing
some primatologists to forge a very different set of assumptions about the
conditions under which hominid infants might have evolved . They accept as a
given the proposal (which to many still seems bizarre) that members of their
own species may be a threat to the survival of immatures.
                                        '
                         AN      INFANT   S-EYE     VIEW
     Primatologists can argue endlessly-and no doubt we will-about infan­
ticide's implications for the evolution of human families, and its implications
for primate social structure generally. Yet one observation strikes me as indis­
putable: for a wide variety of primate species, including humans, an incursion
of unrelated males who never mated with the mother is potentially bad news
for immatures-especially those not yet weaned. Hence we need to recon­
sider some aspects of child development, such as the emergence of an acute
panic response, specifically when infants are approached by strangers. It is a
phobia that appears almost universally in older infants, just about the time
that infants, although likely to still be nursing, become physically able to
crawl away from their mothers.
Prior to five or six months of age, infants smile indiscriminately at almost
anyone. It is as if this is a honeymoon period during which an infant becomes
familiar with its local community, mostly kin. Around six months of age,
however, infants begin to respond quite differently to unfamiliar people.
Novel objects continue to be interesting, but the "visual looming" of a strange
human jolts the infant into vigilance. His pulse rate rises; he may begin to
cry. In the words of developmental psychologist Daniel Freedman: "Animate
strangers are the major source of fear for infants in the second half of the first
year." Strangers strike toddlers as especially fearsome if they are encountered
in a strange place, if they are tall, male, bearded, 15 or if the infant is used to
living among familiar people (rather than, say, in an orphanage), and is not
                               16
accustomed to new faces.
    At one level, a fear of ostensibly harmless strangers seems an irrational
phobia. But return with me to the forests of Paraguay where the Ache live,
and where anthropologists Kim Hill and Magdalena Hurtado decided not
merely to ask people what they said they feared but to collect data on what
actually killed them. Hill and Hurtado painstakingly verified the deaths of
881 of the I ,493 Ache born since I 89o, all of them nomads who died prior to
 I 971, before the Ache settled near the mission stations where they mostly
live today. They were able to determine cause of death in 84 3 cases. Fevers
and intestinal disorders (especially among children in the process of being
weaned) were common. Of those dying from lethal accidents, snakebite was

Fig. 1 7. 2 Fear of strangers tends to emerge at around six to eight months of age and appears to be
a universal developmental stage. This filmstrip was made among New Guinea highlanders by

the likeliest cause-eighteen adults ages fifteen and over, and eight children
between four and fourteen, died after being bitten by a snake. During the
same period, nine adults (but no children , probably because of the sorts of
precautions just discussed) were killed by jaguars. Such data for other forest­
living hunter-gatherers hint at the same pattern: snakes and predators are not
hazards to be taken lightly.17

    Oddly, though, infants don't have an innate fear of cats-big or small.
Snakes, it is true, do have a peculiar salience. All primates fixate on them, take
special notice, and once frightened, never forget. Yet typically, infants first
must learn to be frightened of snakes by watching other group members
react to them.18 Experiments demonstrate that young monkeys learn to be
afraid of snakes more readily than they learn to be afraid of, say, flowers, and
that young primates pay very close attention to snakes or any long ropelike
object on the ground that even looks like a snake; but all the same, they do
have to learn from others that snakes are scary. (Once learned though, snake
phobias prove particularly persistent.)19
    But strange humans (especially adult males) are another story. No one
teaches babies to fear strangers. T heir panic derives from a built-in prejudice
so deep it persists in spite of every reassurance the parent offers. The most
benign and mellow of men, a friend from work encountered in the super­
market, elicits a panic not alleviated by anything short of asking the mortified
well-wisher to back off (or insisting Granddad shave his beard).
    Across primates, very little is known about spontaneous "fear of
strangers" in developing infants. It does not appear that monkey infants pass
through such a phase. Indeed, Ryne Palombit, who studied infant-killing by
strange male baboons at Moremi in Botswana, recalls youngsters fascinated
by novel males, attempting to approach and socialize with them. In several
instances, the males they "befriended" were the same ones who later killed
them. Unlike humans, monkey infants apparently learn to fear strange males
through frightening experiences. Chimpanzees, however, are reported to
develop spontaneous fear of strangers on roughly the same schedule as
human babies.
                20
    The dawning realization that infanticide may have been a chronic threat
during hominid evolution provides another possible reason why strangers
would be a useful addition to a little hominid's repertoire of fears. During the
period when th<� Ache described above were still leading a nomadic life in the
forest, ) ) percent of mortality among children between birth and five years
could be attributed to something an adult member of the same species did.
Of children under the age of three, Hill and Hurtado documented three
daughters and one son killed by their mother, and three daughters killed by
their father (granted, these were hardly strangers). Two other children died
from neglect; one was buried alive; five were left behind when the group
mewed; eleven children were sacrificed along with an adult; and two died
                                  "

Fig. 1 7. 3 Infanticide has long weighed on human imaginations. According to Greek myths about
Cronos Det·ourino His Children (the title of this 182o painting by Goya), the Titaness Rhea was a
mother with a problem. Every time she gave birth, her husband devoured her newborns. At last,
pregnant with Zeus, Rhea decided upon a ruse suggested to her by Mother Earth. She hid the
new baby deep in a ca,·e (some say it was the Cave of the Dictean Zeus on the island of Crete,
where bells, still audible today, chimed every time the baby cried to disguise his whereabouts).
This time, when Cronos accosted Rhea, she handed him an enormous boulder wrapped in swad­
dling clothes. "Wretch! He knew not in his heart," exclaimed Hesiod (ca. 720 II. C.) that the baby
Zeus still lived and would soon overcome his father by force. Psychoanalysts have focused on the
"oedipal" tensions between father and son. Sociobiologists paid more attention to the timeless
maternal counterstrategy of deceiving males. Children hearing the story just noticed how scary
it all seemed. (Court<')' of.lluuo del ProJo, Madrid)

when their mother died. But there were twenty-four cases of homicide
involving nine girls and fifteen boys ages birth to fourteen. One was shot, and
twenty other children were captured by hostile Paraguayans. These threats to
child well-being would indeed have been posed by relative strangers.
I would not argue with those who complain that contemporary British or
American society is "anti-child." Still, one has to ask, compared with when?
Compared with where? Truly special is the society in which children never
need to be afraid, and frankly I think such a society is more feasible today than
in the past.
    Admittedly, this is an odd whodunit, a less-than-scientific form of reverse
engineering: asking what an infant's separation anxiety tells us about past
threats in our evolutionary past. But it leads us to posit novel, previously
undreamed-of explanations for a universal phenomenon like "fear of
strangers." In many traditional settings, for a toddler just able to move away
from its mother not to fear strange adults would seem a dangerous fantasy,
perilously out of touch with realities in the worlds where our ancestors
evolved. In some contexts, fear of strangers would prove itself a phobia
worth suffering from.

surnve, and w h"ICh pens
     More often than not, however, this drama of"trifling differences" is played
out among trifling organisms, among mere cells in the form of sperm and
ova, among conceptuses, neonates, hatchlings, fledglings, and weanlings, that
flit only briefly across the evolutionary stage. As Darwin put it, "Eggs or very
young animals seem generally to suffer most."2 The curtain falls before what
most of us think of as the play has even begun, the actors gone almost as soon
as they are conceived, leaving no trace.
     Surviving to Infancy
Each individual that survives to breed has first to hatch (if oviparous) or (if
viviparous) to set up shop and extract resources from the mother efficiently
enough and long enough to be born viable. Selection may begin even be­
fore any of these creatures leaves the protection of a follicle, an egg, their
mother's womb. For some creatures, only a fraction of a female's eggs are
even ovulated to begin with.
     Consider the human case. By six months' gestation, even while still an
embryo, each future mother has within her fresh-minted ovaries her full
complement of oocytes, some seven million-fourteen thousand times more
than will ever ripen to ovulation. For a woman who successfully bears five
                                         '
                        AN   INFANT        S-EYE    VIEW
infants, this is on the order of I ·4 million times more eggs than she will ever
convert into progeny.
    Why so many e99s remains a mystery. Even before she is born, a female still
in utero herself is losing eggs at a rate of approximately one every four min­
utes. From then until menopause, when, down to her last 2oo or so, a woman
ceases to reproduce, attrition is tremendous. Even so, the redundancy is stag­
gering. What is it for?
    One explanation is that an extravagant number of eggs guards against
duds. The worst-case scenario would be that none were viable when needed.
Prior to ovulation all these egg-precursors arc essentially identical to cells of
the mother's body. Yet flukes happen. In the course of their development,
subtle differences between eggs emerge, making one a better candidate for
ovulation than another.
    Since the follicle matures but only proceeds to ovulation and conception
if all systems arc go, a wealth of eggs (though perhaps not seven million?)
accommodates quite a few false starts. Perhaps overproduction of oocytcs
permits the luxury of having only the best of several available follicles
selected from those ready each cycle. No one really knows. My own guess is
that the answer is related to the benefits for mothers of being able to start,
abort, and start again, the better to control her reproductive schedule and
with it the viability of the end product. Here is quantity in the service of
quality.
    Behavior of Oocytes
Scientists arc just beginning to fathom some of the ways oocytes react to the
world beyond their follicular walls . Improvement in maternal energy balance
(a �-to-1 o-perccnt increase in body weight) enhances the likelihood of higher
maternal estrogen levels; these in turn enhance the probability that a woman
will ovulate and produce a fertile egg that month. Laboratories producing in
vitro fertilizations have noticed that eggs from larger follicles also have an
advantage after fertilization, since they arc more likely to implant success­
fully. 3
    Further complicating a complex situation, the follicle surrounding the
egg is also receiving instructions from the oocyte within. A growth factor
secreted by the oocyte alters the outer layer's responsiveness to signals from
reproductive hormones in nearby cells. It is possible that, along with mater­
nal condition, some attribute of the egg itself shapes the destiny of its follicle.
                         EMPOWERING                       THE EMBRYO
   Fig. 18. 1 This embryo never managed to convert itself
      into viahle descendants. Still, it is hard to imagine a
  more durable embryo than this fossil found in deposits
from China dating to po million years ago. It was on its
      way to becoming some kind of multicellular animal
    with a complex life cycle when it was frozen in time.
                               (Courtesy '?[S. Xiao anJA.ll. Knoll)
Follicles communicate with other cells in the vicinity, and respond to slight
changes in the mother month to month. Moreover, inherent qualities of each
oocyte and its surrounding follicle affect the probability of ovulation versus
decay. "Many are culled, but few arc chosen," human reproductive ecologist
James Wood wrote before these latest discoveries. An updated epitaph for an
egg might read: "Many are culled but few succeed in volunteering."4
     Only a fraction of oocytes ever rouse from hibernation. Most remain
cloistered in the m•ary. Gradually they degenerate and are reabsorbed locally.
Nunlike, they age celibate and in situ through a gentle process known as atre­
sia. Only rarely is an egg just an egg's way of making another egg. Atresia, not
ovulation, is the fate of most. Of the lucky ovulates, even fewer are fertilized,
elevated to the status of conceptus. Every conception, then, occurs at the cost
of alternative ovulations, essentially alternative lives. The chances of an egg
becoming a daughter are in the vicinity of one in ten million. The odds that
that daughter will survive to breed, that that egg's egg will perpetuate her
line, go down from there.
     Why So Many Eggs?
A great deal of evolutionary theorizing about sex differences rests on the cen­

a male's sperm cell is smaller than an egg." Obviously, though, life is more
complicated. Reality must intrude.
    At the level of wastage we arc talking about here, relative cheapness is like
talking about the price of hydrogen versus the price of oxygen, so abundant
are they both as to make the relative cost of either sex's germ line incidental
to the big picture. Even given the fading viability of her eggs between genesis
and menopause, each woman is born with more ova than she could possibly
convert into offspring. What is costly, as well as what makes human life so
valuable, is not the egg, or even the conceptus, but the nurturin9 it takes to
rear a human being. My own guess is that it is because irifants are so cost!f to rear
that in species like humans women have so many eaas.
    How do I arrive at this idea? Estimates of just how many conceptions
(once ovulated and fertilized) make it past the first cut to implantation arc
problematic since very early pregnancies are rarely detected. In the case of
primates, we can only estimate the risks of fetal loss between conception and
implantation . Information about losses is more accurate after implantation.
For well-nourished monkeys, safe from predators and monitored for diseases
in breeding colonies, as well as for humans living in modern cities, roughly
 2o percent of pregnancies detected at implantation end in fetal death.        Rates
vary tremendously with maternal nutrition, health, and stress levels. When
conditions deteriorate, loss rates skyrocket. 7
    Much early mortality is attributable to nothing more than bad timing.
Among humans, for example, mother's age is an important predictor of how
likely she is to spontaneously abort. Teenage mothers, and especially women
over age thirty-five, are at higher risk . A fetus conceived by a woman in her
mid-twenties has the highest probability of being carried all the way to term. 8
    As always, there is the luck of the genetic draw. Most chromosomally
abnormal conceptuses will be aborted even before they implant. Chance
plays a big role, yet surprising opportunities for selection to act on embryos
persist. Embryos might secrete hormones that forestall spontaneous abortion
or jack up nutrients their mothers supply them.
    Embryonic Decisions
Few people think about differences between one embryo and another,
much less imagine embryos "making decisions," pursuing one developmental
course rather than another. Yet it would be a mistake to assume that an
 embryo is an embryo is an embryo. To assume that they are alike simply

                       AN    INFANT       S-EYE     VIEW
attests to how rarely biologists find opportunities to examine the behavior of
embryos. Recently, a few have begun to.
    W hen Karen Warkentin, a graduate student at the University ofTexas,
noticed that eggs laid by red-eyed tree frogs at her study site in Costa Rica
took anywhere from five to thirteen days to hatch, she began to wonder if
(looking at it from the embryo's point of view) there might be a reason.
    It is assumed that adult survival among these colorful green frogs, with
their red eyes, orange hands, and bright blue-and-yellow-striped sides,
depends on such "decisions" as remaining hidden from predators during day­
time and waiting to go out in the open until night, when they can feed under
cover of darkness. But what kind of decisions could embryonic tadpoles, still
dependent on the yolk of their eggs, profitably make?
    Warkentin knew that parents deposit gelatinous masses of eggs on leaves
hanging above their future home in the pond below. That way, embryos have a
chance to grow bigger before they confront aquatic predators, mostly shrimp
and fish. But not quite all of their predators are aquatic. Should a snake hap­
pen upon their leaf, the eggs find themselves caught between a snake and a
shrimp-ridden place. Warkentin knew that, at her study site, more than 50
percent of clutches are attacked by snakes. Hence she experimentally intro­
duced a snake onto the leafy refuge of five-day-old eggs while leaving control
eggs of the same age to develop undisturbed. Confronted with certain con­
sumption if they stay put, but only a possibility of being eaten if they drop, the
nearly mature eggs respond to snake attack by jolting themselves into hatch­
ing prematurely, rupturing surrounding membranes and sliding off the leaf
into the pond below. 9
    As Warkentin watched a snake gulp a mouthful of eggs, which she assumed
must all be doomed, one wriggling tadpole popped head-first back out of the
corner of the snake's mouth! Eggs oblivious to wind and rain, even earth­
quakes, have evolved to react immediately to the vibrations of a snake's
attack. Embryos with the developmental flexibility to fast-forward on a split
second's notice arc more likely to survive. Of those some will one day meta­
morphose into scr<.'nading males whose clucks and other breeding antics get
all the notice, completely eclipsing the key role played by the embryonic pre­
cursor to that actor in the spotlight.
    Elsewhere among the amphibians, predator-induced hatching is played
out in reverse . For example, some salamander larvae slow down hatching if
they sense the presence of predatory gangs of flatworms.T he larger the sala-

Fig. 18.3 Eggs of red-eyed tree frogs arc jolted into early hatching by a snake's attack. In some
o\·iparous animals, ranging from robins to crocodiles, hatchlings continue to benefit from
parental care and protection. In others, howe,·er, mothers endow eggs at laying with all the
investment they will ever receive. In such cases embryos arc on their own. They make their own

a knock or a consultation with their mom . (Photo couruv '?[Karenllilrkentin)
manders are when they hatch , the better endowed they are to escape being
eaten. In this case predator-delayed hatching is the ticket to survival. 10 Only
by being able to imagine embryos as active agents did researchers finally
observe "predator-delayed" and "predator-induced" hatching, though the phe­
nomena obviously had been occurring all along.
     Parent-Offspring Conflict
Even when they are essentially able to reach across the driver's seat to adjust
the accelerator determining exactly when they hatch, embryos can't do much
about the size and make of their vehicle. They must confine themselves to the
resources present when the mother produced the egg. They must, as it were,
play it as they arc laid.
     However, among viviparous and suckling creatures like mammals­
de,·eloping embryos whose mothers bear and then nurse live young-imma­
tures can aspire to more control over when they arc born and how long they
arc nurtured. They may also negotiate how much of their mother's resources
they will be allocated. To imagine embryos and sucklings as active agents this
way is a new way of thinking about gestation and lactation. Instead of a model

Fig. 18.4 Trivers's theory of"parcnt-offspring conflict" drew evolutionary biologists into an out­
landish domain where immatures arc elevated to the status of main characters on the evolution­
ary stage. One is reminded of Grancel Fitz's pre-World War II photographic series dcpicting"Big
Baby" lording it over his mother. (Courtts y '![Keith de ullis Gallery, NewYork)
comprising all-giving mothers and passive babies, this is a very different
world inhabited by empowered embryos and manipulative weanlings.
    It was RobertTrivers, the same young biologist who had shown how rela­
tive parental investment by females and males shaped Darwinian sexual
selection, who elevated previously "disenfranchised" life phases in immature
organisms to the status of active players with agendas of their own.
    In the early      1 97os, Trivers began to empower immature life phases by
talking about infants-formerly viewed as agendaless grubs, passive tickets
to posterity purchased by parents-as active agents whose behaviors could
affect their own fates. "In classical evolutionary theory parent-offspring rela­
tions arc viewed from the standpoint of the parent," he wrote in his classic
1 974 paper outlining what he liked to call the underlying "logic" of parent-
                     EMJ>OWERING           THE     EMBRYO
offspring conflict. "Parents arc classically assumed to allocate investment in
their young in such a way as to maximize the number surviving, while off­
spring are implicitly assumed to he passive vessels into which parents pour
the appropriate care."11 His was a revolutionary perspective.
   Thinking like a revolutionary was something that came naturally to
Trivers. On paper, another upper-middle-class, prep-school-educated white
male graduate of Han·ard, during his graduate school years doing fieldwork
in Jamaica (studying lizards) he transformed himself in dress, speech, ganja
habits-even a propensity for bar brawls-into a convert, body and soul, of
the Caribbean culture he adopted.T hinking back to those days, and to a time
when there were anti-sociobiology demonstrations at Trivers's lectures on
the grounds that he was seeking biological justification for an oppressive sta­
tus quo, I can only smile and shake my head. In fact, I doubt that Robert
Trivers ever met an institutionalized status quo that he didn't feel driven to
destabilize.
             12
Previous generations of psychologists had not failed to notice the existence of
"conflicting opinions" between parents and offspring. But by and large these
disagreements were viewed in terms of the conflict between biology and cul­
ture. AsTrivers put it, the baby was viewed as innately selfish, animalistic and
greedy, in need of socialization. "This theory sees conflict as arising from the
innate barbarity of the child."13 Predictably, in seeking an evolutionary expla­
nation for the conflict,Trivers identified with oppressed immatures.
    At the time, he was already serving as British biologist William D. Hamil­
ton's self-appointed bulldog, promoting his then little appreciated ideas on
how degree of genetic relatedness among relatives influences their behavior
toward one another. Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness preadaptedTrivers
to understand parent-offspring conflict. An infant is related to itself 1 oo per­
cent but shares only half of its genes by common descent with its mother, and
so percent with her subsequent offspring, if full siblings; more like 2S per­
cent, however, if they have different fathers. The mother will be equally
related to all her offspring. Taking all this into account, conflict as well as a
large measure of cooperation is an expected feature of their relations. "In par­
ticular," Trivers noted, " parent and offspring are expected to disagree over
                                                  1

the extended mother-centered Jamaican family that he became part of after marr iage to his first
wife, Lorna Stapleton. He is shown here carrying their son, together with Lorna (laughing), at
the Stapleton home in rural Jamaica. (Courrery '![Anbcrr I Trn·m)

how long the period of parental investment should last, over the amount of
parental investment that should be given, and over the altruistic and egoistic
tendencies of the otfspring as these tendencies affect other relativcs."14
    To the extent that investment provided by the mother to one offspring
detracts from what is available to her other offspring (current or future),
mothers and offspring arc likely to disagree over the allocation. Trivers
phrased the genetic logic underlying this conflict in simple cost-benefit equa­
tions. For example, a mother is expected to encourage altruistic acts among
her offspring (to whom she is equally related) when the benifit to one <?[her C?ff­
sprin8 is 9reater than the cost to another. The offspring forced to give up some
benefit, however, only agrees (without sulking or dragging its heels), if the
benefit is twice (or even four times) his own costs. Offspring arc only
                     EMPOWERING           THE     EMBRYO
expected to stop begging or attempting to extract more from the mother
when the cost to her (in terms of her ability to survive and invest in other off­
spring) is more than twice the benefit that the offspring receives.
    Many mothers exhibit an intuitive sense of what they arc up against. In
her biography Nisa .recalls: "When mother was pregnant with Kumsa [her
younger brother), I was always crying. I wanted to nurse!" She also wanted
her mother to carry her. When the baby was finally born, Nisa's mother told
her to get a stick, as they would have to bury the baby alive since it had
arrh·ed after too short an interval. Whereupon Nisa herself announced: "My
baby brother? My little brother? Mommy, he's my brother! Pick him up and
carry him back to the village. I don't want to nurse!" Feeling personally
responsible for her younger brother's fate in this way, Nisa accepted being
weaned, although occasionally when her mother was asleep she would
remoYe her little brother from the breast and suckle herself. 15
    Tantrums
Weaning conflicts epitomized for Trivers the disagreement over how much
and for how long a mother should provision her offspring. Because the off­
spring is selected to devalue the cost of parental investment, it will favor a
longer period of investment than the parent is selected to give. Just after
birth, when suckling is essential for her infant's survival, a mother and baby
are likely to be of one opinion. Indeed, it is often the mother herself who ini­
tiates nipple contact. As the infant becomes increasingly independent of the
mother, however, the burden for initiating contact with the nipple shifts: the
infant is more motivated to suckle than the mother is to provide additional
nourishment. What is an infant to do? AsTrivers put it, "An offspring cannot
fling its mother to the ground and nurse at will." Because the offspring is
smaller and less experienced than its parent, and its parent is in control of the
resources at issue, this competitive disadvantage forces the offspring to resort
                          16
to psychological tactics.
    Tantrums are the most dramatic, outward, and visible manifestation of
these tactics. Though they appear to be spontaneous outbursts, Trivers be­
lieYed tantrums could be quite calculated. Infants engage in manipulative
exaggeration of emotional and physiological states. In various species, includ­
ing chimpanzees and humans, older infants frequently employ them, and
continue to use such tactics throughout their lives. 17 Yes, offspring are
defenseless, but they can nevertheless take advantage of existing means of
                                        '
43°                     AN   INFANT S-EYE          VIEW
communication to exaggerate their need, or vulnerability, perhaps acting
younger or pretending to be in greater physiological distress than is actually
the case. Immatures may play on their mothers' concern for their well-being.
If temper tantrums seem crazy, Trivers believed they were "crazy like a fox."18
    When Hinde told Trivers about the rhesus mother-infant separation
experiments that had just been completed at the Madingley facility (at Cam­
bridge University), Trivers barely heard the parts related to attachment the­
ory. His imagination was inflamed by what the Madingley observations
seemed to reveal about the underlying logic of the infant's attitude toward its
mother, and for a time, as he described it, he could think of nothing else.
    Rhesus infants whose mothers had already begun weaning or who were
rejecting prior to the separation, and infants whose mothers were taken away
rather than vice versa, tried harder to stay close when the mother returned
than did an infant whose mother had not already been trying to distance her­
self; such infants also strove harder for proximity than did the infants who had
been removed from the cage. ForTrivers, sensitive to the underlying tensions
of the relationship, the implications were enormous. The infant monkey
appeared to be acting on "the logical assumption that a rejectin8 mother who
temporarily disappears needs more offspring surveillance than does a non­
rejectin8 mother who temporarily disappears." It was an observation Bowlby
had already made. But Trivers interpreted it in an even broader evolutionary
framework.19
    What struck him was "seeing that all the machinations Freud imagined
going on early in life had reality (which I had formerly disbelieved), but that
[Freud] had misinterpreted it. For two months I had what you might call a
brainstorm. Night and day I thought about nothing else.... "20Throughout
his career, Trivers, like some tribal shaman, would delve into his own subcon­
scious, then return with novel insights about his own social situation, which
he then translated back into the language of evolutionary biology. Of the
experimental results from Madingley that had stirred him so deeply, he sim­
ply noted:
    T hese data arc consistent with the expectation that the offspring
    should he sensitive to the meanin9 of events affecting its relationship to
    its mother. T he offspring can differentiate between a separation from
    its mother caused by its own behavior or some accident (olTspring
    removed from group) and a separation which may have been caused hy

    maternal negligence (mother removed from group). In the former
    kind of separation, the infant shows less effect when reunited, because
    from its point of view, such a separation does not reflect on its mother
    and no remedial action is indicated.21
    Maternal-Fetal Contracts
In 1978, Trivers left Harvard for the University of California, and eventually
Rutgers. He was succeeded at Harvard by an Australian geneticist named
David Haig. Trivers jokingly referred to Haig as occupying "the Trivers Chair
in Evolutionary Logic."22 Given the role Haig would play in extending
Trh·ers's ideas, this was a remarkably apt title, even though it might have
come as a shock to the Harvard administrators who no doubt breathed a sigh
of relief when one of their most iconoclastic faculty members packed his
Banja and rolled west.
    During a post-doc at Oxford, Haig had familiarized himself with the vistas
from what Hamilton (who had by then joined the zoology department there)
calls the "Narrow Roads of Gene Land." Haig was fluent in Dawkins-style the­
orizing about the machinations of "selfish genes."23 But over time, he also
began to invent a new set of metaphors to explain the behavior of genes.
Today, Haig is more likely to describe genes as "social"-members of a team,
participants in what Egbert Leigh famously termed a "parliament of genes"
rather than as purely selfish. Or, to quote Haig: "The complex behaviors and
structures that have evolved by the process of natural selection can be viewed
as adaptations for the good of the relevant genes ('replicators' ) rather than
for the good of individual organisms ('vehicles' ) .. . . But organisms can also
be viewed as collective entities (like firms, communes, unions, charities,
teams) and the behaviors and decisions of collective bodies need not mirror
those of their individual members." Although still interested in "the internal
conflicts that can disrupt genetic societies" (intra-genomic conflict), he is also
intrigued hy the "social contracts that have evolved to mitigate these con­
flicts," especially conflicts between maternal and fetal genes.24
    It fell to Haig to trace implications of "parent-offspring conflict" back
through ontogenetic time from a tantrum-throwing toddler to a placenta­
building fetus. Like Trivers's, Haig's passion in science was not so much for
experiments or new discoveries, but rather for making sense of puzzles in the
world around him. Instead of apologizing for metaphors that ascribe agency
to genes, he simply points out that "Natural selection is a purposeless process
                                          ,
                       AN INFANT            S-EYE   VIEW
with purposeful products." Thinking of genetic outcomes in terms of "the
language of purpose" is a useful shorthand. 25
    Haig was one of a handful of pioneers in the arcane new field of"genetic
imprinting," the still poorly understood process by which the same gene is
expressed differently depending upon which parent it comes from. Haig the­
orized about a special class of genes that could "remember" whether they
came from the mother or from the father, and act accordingly to promote
either maternal or paternal interests.
   Apparently, some genes inherit molecular "imprints" from respective
maternal and paternal germ lines, so that it is possible for the expression of
genes to be turned either on or off-that is, silenced in the course of devel­
opment or turned up-depending on parent of origin. For most genes, this
would make no difference. However, a minority of genes-possibly no more
than fifty or so genes out of some 7 !i, ooo genes found in a human-are either
activated or silenced depending on whether they are maternally or paternally
imprinted.
    What first struck Haig was how many of the imprinted genes discovered
so far involve growth, perhaps especially growth in utero. Given that growth
during gestation and lactation occurs at the expense of the mother's bodily
resources, Haig began to see self-serving method in the madness of parent­
specific genes.
    In animals like mice where females are inseminated by successive males ,
paternally imprinted genes would have no "compunction" against extract­
ing as many resources as possible from the mother, even if the pregnancy
depleted her capacity to reproduce in the future. They must be countered by
maternally imprinted genes coding for thriftier development-for males
would have a stake in the future welfare of a mate (past her period of mater­
nal investment in their single shared litter) only if they had evolved in monog­
                                                       26
amous mating systems, which these mice had not.
    By 1996, Shirley Tilghman and other molecular geneticists at Princeton
undertook a series of experiments with specially genetically engineered
strains of mice to test Haig's predictions. Ideas that had once seemed little
more than wildly speculative gleams in Haig's eye were correctly predicting
fetal growth in mice depending on which parent's genes were in charge. 27 At
a given genetic locus, experimentally manipulated mouse embryos received
either all their genetic instructions from the father or all from the mother.
                      EMPOWERING            THE    EMBRYO                     433
Untrammeled expression of paternally imprinted genes produced giant
babies, 1 3o percent of normal size at birth. Fetuses whose growth factors
were monopolized by maternal instructions were dwarfed down to 6o
percent of normal size.28 In 1998, the strangest imprinted gene of all was
described-the mest gene, which is expressed only when it is inherited from
the father, neYer expressed if inherited from the mother. Mother mice whose
only copy of the mest comes from their mother exhibit deficient maternal
responses and, in particular, fail to eat the placenta after birth, missing out on
that last dose of fetal propaganda. 29
    It occurred to Haig that if he was right about the long history of compet­
ing agendas carried forward in each fetus bearing imprinted genes from
mother and progenitor, then "the interplay of opposing forces may be essen­
tial for a successful outcome to the pregnancy."30 It was like a tug-of-war,
where players adjust themselves to their tugging opponents by pulling too­
in the opposite direction. Haig speculated that some of the more puzzling
inefficiencies of pregnancy, as well as some of its occasional pathologies, were
actually by-products of this long history of conflicting agendas. No longer
upright, the participants lean markedly in one direction or the other, so that if
the tugging ever stops, they topple over.
    The Fetus's Supply Line
The idea of competing interests led Haig straight to the primary organ
that brokers the transfer of resources between the mother and the mam­
malian fetus: the placenta. If paternally active genes bent on extracting extra
resources from the mother to nourish that male's offspring were going to
exist anywhere, the supply line to the fetus would be the place to look, Haig
reasoned. 31
    Obstetricians have long referred to the placenta as "a ruthless parasitic
organ existing solely for the maintenance and protection of the fetus, perhaps
too often to the disregard of the maternal 01·ganism."32 They were aware
that maternal options concerning whether or not to terminate a pregnancy
decrease markedly once implantation occurs, since the placenta secretes hor­
mones that maintain the pregnancy. Usurping the authority of the maternal
pituitary, the placenta sy nthesizes large quantities of a hormone called
chorionic gonadotropin (the hormone whose presence causes the white
 Cheerio to form in early pregnancy detection kits) and releases pregnancy-
                                       '
434                     AN   INFANT S-EYE VIEW
maintaining hormones into the mother's bloodstream. In effect, after twelve
 weeks, the fetus is in a strong position to command the mother's body to
 carry on with the pregnancy.
    As with any well-organized invasion, the next step is to establish supply
lines. In some mammals, including prosimians such as the galago, a relatively
"noninvasive" placenta absorbs nutrients secreted by glands in the mother's
uterus (referred to as "uterine milk"). In others, including mice, bats,
armadillos, and "higher" primates (monkeys and apes), the placenta has
evolved so as to tap directly into the mother's bloodstream. As the embryo
implants within the uterine lining, cells branch out that destroy the wall sep­
arating mother and growing embryo and remodel the endometrial spiral
arteries, even expanding the diameter of blood vessels. The mother is unable
to constrict the vessels supplying the embryo, so that, in Haig's words, the
mother "cannot regulate the flow of nutrients to the placenta without starv­
ing her own tissues."33 Thus does the fetus gain considerable control over its
own provisioning.
    By the eighth week of human gestation, the placenta composes a whop­
ping 85" percent of the total package. End to end, the villi (finger-like projec­
tions growing out of the outer membrane of the embryo to increase the
absorptive surface of the placenta) stretch about thirty miles. Once this mas­
sive infrastructure has secured the supply lines, the fetus itself starts to grow,
unless the mother is malnourished. If there are few resources to go around,
the placenta still grows large, but the baby remains small. Specialists in fetal
development have come to regard a large placenta as the first and most obvi­
ous sign of a malnourished fetus. 34
    Maternal-Fetal Negotiations overTime of Birth, etc.
As much as an immature benefits from remaining in the womb, dimensions of
the mother's pelvic canal set a limit on how long gestation can last before it
imperils both parties. The exact moment of birth can be viewed as a negoti­
ated settlement between embryonic demands and maternal assessments of
the environment they will both inhabit. Extrapolating from data on sheep and
monkeys, it is assumed that the baby's brain sends signals that increase estro­
gen production.
    Estradiol released from the placenta stimulates the production of the hor­
mone oxytocin and the signaling molecules (called prostaglandins) that pro­
mote coordinated muscle contractions, which deli\'cr the baby. It is the
                    I'M.J>OWERING          THE EMBRYO                          4-H
mother, however, who ultimately controls levels of oxytocin, and hence the
precise tim<.' when she gives birth.Among primates, birth begins during the
hours when the mother and her group arc least active-nighttime for diurnal
primates-thus increasing the odds that parturition occurs in a safe spot.35
(Although they may not know why it occurs, those attending in              hospital
maternity wards ha,·e come to expect this nighttime peak in deliveries.)
   Long befo1·e sociobiologists raised the specter that the mother's interac­
tions with the fetus developing inside her might be other than harmonious,
generations of pathologists had already dipped into the lexicon of warfare to
describe what plainly looked to them like an "invasion" of the lining of the
mother's uterus by fetally derived cells. In the words of one pathologist writ­
ing in the Journal if Obstetrics and GynaecoloBY if the British Empire just around
the outbreak of World War I: "T he border zone ...marks the division
between the foetal and maternal tissues. .. .It is the fighting line where the
conflict between the maternal cells and the invading trophoderm takes place,
and it is strewn with . . .the dead on both sides."36 Haig was not the first to
borrow military \'Ocabulary to describe the placenta, but he found the anal­
ogy useful.
   Haig assumed that the placenta originally evolved in a world where moth­
ers experienced periodic unpredictable famines, such that investment in cur­
rent offspring might well detract from a mother's future ability to reproduce.
Under such circumstances, it's each player for herself.After birth, infant
ploys to circumvent maternal economies are played out through tantrums
and other behador; prior to birth, fetal grabs for a bigger share of resources
arc mediated by chemical messengers sent coursing across the placenta into
the mother's bloodstream. Under normal circumstances what enforces the
truce, though, is not just the fetus's current and future dependence on its
nurturer but, Haig speculates, a "fifth column" established in the fetus by
maternally imprinted genes that evolved to counter fetal greed.
   Various medical pathologies can be explained by this accumulated history
of conflicting agendas. If one side or the other were underrepresented-if,
for example, there was a genetic deletion of either the paternal command
or the maternal countermand-there could be serious repercussions. Hor­
mones such as human placental lactogen, produced by the placenta, increase
nutrients like glucose in the mother's bloodstream. To drown out such hor­
monal propaganda, the mother is forced to issue even stronger instructions
of her own, work orders calling for more insulin.If for some reason the
                                        '
436                    AN INFANT S-EYE VIEW
mother's body fails to counter the fetal command on cue, diabetes could
result as an unfortunate by-product of the fetus's call for sugar-rich blood.
Outcomes detrimental to both mother and fetus, such as the form of preg­
nancy hypertension known as preeclampsia, could represent a last-ditch
effort by a poorly nourished fetus to increase its supply of nutrients. Given
that low-birth-weight infants are especially likely to suffer from high blood
pressure later in life, this drastic survival-at-any-cost fetal ploy (raising the
mother's blood pressure in an effort to avoid starvation of the embryo) might
not only take an immediate toll on the mother, but might also take a continu­
ing toll from the embryo after birth, through infancy and into adult life, con­
tributing to a lifetime of high blood pressure. 37 Amazingly, one of the best
predictors of hypertension at age fifty is a combined measure of-what
else?-placental weight and birth weight. 38
    For anyone puzzled-as I was-as to why a gene involved in placentopha­
gia (eating the· placenta after birth) should be expressed when transmitted
from father to daughter but not when passed from mother to daughter, the
placenta's role in promoting fetal interests is an obvious point to consider. Yet
the more I try to understand what is going on with the genetically imprinted
mest gene, the more puzzled I become. When would it be more in a father's
than a mother's interest for a daughter to continue to be swayed by fetal pro­
paganda after birth? What is still missing in this story? There is a very great
deal left to know. Such curious facets of development-undreamed of just
ten years ago-are only beginning to be studied. Over the next few decades,
the study of imprinted genes is going to open up a whole new window into
the dynamics of sexual interaction, and competition between matrilineal and
patrilineal interests.
    No one is suggesting that outcomes so detrimental to organisms-the
unwitting "vehicles" transporting self-serving "replicators" vying among
themselves to cancel each other out-arc by design. Nor do such findings
mean that a mother is inevitably pitted against her mate, or her fetus. For
better or for worse, two parents, and to an even greater extent mother and
fetus, are self-interested members of the same team. As Trivers cautioned
decades ago, "Unlike conflict between unrelated individuals, parent-offspring
conflict is expected to he circumscribed by the close genetic relationships
between parent and off:spnng..  ,!'1
    As long as circumstances arc "for better," all goes well (as when mothers
have plenty of food and adequately long spaces between births to recoup). As
                     EMPOWERING            THE EMBRYO                        437
long as the team is winning, both parties get along fine. But humans evolved
in an unpredictable world, where neither party could count on things going
well.
    Putting Maternal-Fetal Conflict in Context
The pendulum has swung from depicting the most intimate human relation­
ship as a harmonious partnership in which a fetus placidly "shares every
breath that its mother takes and every meal that its mother eats" to the post­
Trivcrs view emphasizing a team composed of players who share some goals
but not others. At their most sensationalized, these disparate maternal-fetal
interests arc described as a "war in the womb.'>+0 Omitted from this catchy
sound-bite is the complex dialectical history of maternal, paternal, and fetal
measures and countermeasures implicit in Haig's evolutionary explanation
for the perils and inefficiencies of gestation. Even a chromosomally defective
offspring slated for early spontaneous abortion is not-even metaphori­
cally-in an all-out war with the mother evicting it, although certain of its
genetically produced traits might be. For the mother's next, probably more
viable, tenant will share many of the same genes by common descent. T his is a
fairly subtle dispute in which the different parties have different thresholds
for aborting or proceeding. At multiple points conflict may be exacerbated,
or cooperation enhanced, depending on circumstances.
    Just how inevitable is mother-infant conflict? Cautionary voices were not
long in sounding, reminding theorists how conditional on social and ecologi­
cal circumstances such conflicts could be. One of these voices was Jeanne Alt­
mann, the primate sociobiologist studying mothers and infants in the real
world. Selfish or parliamentary, she was less interested in genes than in how
individuals behave and in situating behavior within "local ecologies." In a gen­
tle rejoinder to Trivers's r 974 paper on "parent-offspring conflict" she sought
to shift attention from the genetic relatedness of mother and infant (who
share 50 percent of their genes by common descent), back to the "cost" and
"benefit" functions that went into the tradeoffs being calculated by a time­
strapped mother and a dependent infant.
    Although Altmann admired the original way Trivers conceptualized
parent-offspring conflict, she wanted more attention paid to the "underlying
mysteries"-to development and the particulars of an individual's life.
Whereas theoreticians focus on hypothetical effects of genes no one can see,
fieldworkers focus on individuals they watch day after day. Unless an animal
                                       '
                        AN INFANT S-EYE            VIEW
manages to survive and reproduce, it scarcely matters what any of those
unseen selfish genes are up, or stoop down, to.
    To Altmann, genes would never be anything more than accretions of mol­
ecules, some of them replicated at different rates, depending on which traits
they produce. She went out of her way to emphasize instances of mother­
infant consensus in response to Trivers weighing in so heavily in the other
direction. Some would argue that she went too far, giving short shrift to con­
flict. But that's one of the ways science (like evolution) proceeds, through
inefficient dialectics. Although some of the baboons at Amboseli did indeed
throw "really wonderful" tantrums-"just like a [human) two-year-old"­
others, she stressed, voluntarily weaned themselves.41
    Baboons, Altmann knew, had lots of other business besides making babies.
A mother ordinarily spends 2 3 percent of each day walking from safe refuges
to feeding places, and another � � percent of each day picking acacia pods or
digging up the underground corms where grasses store their richest nutri­
ents. T his leaves only about    2o percent of daylight hours to qualify as
"leisure," and that's not counting time needed for resting and grooming,
more nearly essential than optional activities. As with most working moms,
there is little slack in this "dual career" baboon mother's life. Suppose a
baboon baby genetically predisposed to demand more milk did manage to
extract it from her-where would the mother find time in the day to
scrounge the extra calories to support such a greedy freeloader? Extracting
more from her would be like getting the proverbial blood from a stone. Half
of all baboons born die within the first two years, and it is not clear what
more the mother could have done to keep them alive. Already those mothers
who are carrying unweaned infants suffer twice the mortality rate of females
unburdened by infants. 42
    For both mother and infant, survival depends on the hypothalamic feed­
back loop that prevents her from conceiving again while she is still nursing a
dependent. Shorten the birth interval, though, and both underwriters of this
precarious consensus are in trouble. So, at five months, a mother baboon in
this population is in no hurry to wean. Nor docs she have the energy to fight
about it. With their mothers already pushed to the physiological limit, in a
population already characterized by (for baboons) long birth intervals, there
exists scant incentive for overt conflict. 4l (Covert conflict, between mother
and a fetus in the womb, was outside of Altmann's purview.)

    When Infants Volunteer to Be Weaned
Just when to wean is a delicate business. If the mother weans too soon, her
infant dies. But if she concedes too much, they both die. This is one reason age
of weaning turns out to be surprisingly negotiable. As the mother responds to
enYironmental conditions, information about her condition is communicated
to her infant . Similarly, information about the infant's nutritional needs is
relayed hack to her m·aries through the frequency and intensity of the infant's
sucking.
    Each party responds to the condition of the other. For example, recent
experiments with rats by Montserrat Gomendio and others at Madinglcy­
thc same animal facility set up years before to test Bowlby's ideas-reveal
that infants prepare themselves for weaning, producing the enzyme sucrase,
which is essential for digesting solid food, at an earlier or later age, depending
on maternal condition. If the mother is pregnant again, pups start to produce
sucrase in preparation for early weaning, although how they "know" remains a
mystery.
    Infants, it appears, "volunteer" to ready themselves for early weaning. Yet if
mother rats are experimentally deprived of food, and in consequence their
infants fail to grow properly, mothers compensate by nursing their pups
longer. These babies begin producing sucrase later, and arc weaned later, but
at the same body weight as infants born to well-fed mothers.44
    EYcn with infants adjusting to maternal condition, and vice versa, the two
parties' knowledge about each other, and about the world around them, can
nc\·er be anything but imperfect. In general, the mother is more experienced
and has more direct access to information about current and future environ­
mental conditions than her infant will. But neither party can know when
rains will come, or when acacia trees will blossom into soft and palatable
foods suitable for just-weaned young. As Altmann reminded, "A mother is to
its infant and an infant is to its mother one of many only partially predictable
environmental variables, not a predetermined constant."45
    No matter how brilliant the insights of the gene theorists, the equivalent
of an ecological glass ceiling weighs heavily on the heads of individuals. Or, as
Haig acknowledges: "It would be a conceptual error to equate the interests of
genes with the interests of individuals. Our genes' purposes arc not our
own.'146

Altmann situates her vision of negotiated consensus between mother and
infant squarely in the local "economy" where baboons make their living, in a
world shaped by rainfall, food availability, population density, and travel dis­
tances. Her model also applies well to human hunter-gatherers in an unpre­
dictable ecosystem. In a case like the nomadic !Kung, where the optimal birth
spacing imposed by constraints upon a gathering mother with no safe place to
stash her baby is four years, few women bear more than five children in a life­
time, and only half of those born arc likely to survive (a mortality rate similar
to that for Amboseli baboons).47 However, among other hunter-gatherer
groups, where allomothers are available back at camp, or where soft and
nutritious weaning foods can be had, or where mothers are better nourished,
birth intervals arc shorter. Even weaned as early as six months, infants can
still survive. But abrupt arrival of subsequent siblings meant successive
neonatal crises for the mother, and varying degrees of neglect as opposed to
indulgence for infants born to her. For once the empowered embryo emerges
into a cold, unlubricated world, and once the umbilical lifeline attaching it to
its agent the placenta is cut, the infant's control over such essentials as food,
shelter, and warmth diminishes. At that point the empowered embryo
becomes a supplicant.
    By the time the baby is expelled by the uterine muscles, it must be pre­
pared for its exile from gestational Eden. From hormonally empowered,
firmly entrenched, fully enfranchised occupant of its mother's body, the
baby's status declines to that of a poor, naked, two-legged mendicant, not
even yet bipedal, a neonate who must appeal in order to be picked up, kept
warm, and be suckled. What the infant encounters in this far less certain
world is largely a matter of luck. Yet there are a few tricks a newborn can try.
Among them are looking good and engaging its mother from birth.

A
            nyone who has ever wondered about the expression "bald as a
            coot," or worried lest a naked pate makes him less lovable, needs to
            meet the little mud-hens that dive for a living in the shallow ponds
ncar my home, mysteriously submerging when I approach, only to resurface
shyly in the reeds. The American coot, Fulica americana, ranges from Canada
down to Mexico. Profligate in egg production, coots lay anywhere from seven
to thirteen eggs on floating nests constr ucted of dead vegetation.
    Sibling Rivalry in Birds
Like many birds, coots routinely lay more eggs than the number of young two
parents can, or will, successfully rear. Coots are among those birds ominously
termed "brood reducers" by or nithologists. One-third to one-half of the
chicks will starve before they fledge. Tough competition at home explains
why baby coots are born not necessarily dressed to kill but certainly garbed
to take their scats among the elect at a fancy banquet. Babies are born spec­
tacularly different from their drab black parents, who sport nothing flashier
than a white bill. The front portion of a baby coot's body is covered with con­
spicuous orange bristles. The eyes and the tip of the red beak arc surrounded
by brilliant papillae, clustered like coral beads, and the nearly bald pate shines
forth a bright vermilion. Being flamboyant enough to attract parental atten­
tion is critical for survival, but it also bears the liability of making newly
hatched chicks conspicuous to predators.
    As David Lack observed years ago for other brood-reducing species, a

                              mother coot lays her eggs sequentially over a
                              period of days, but begins brooding them right
                              away so that the first-laid eggs get a head start and
                              hatch first. Hatching late has serious drawbacks. In
                              species such as the lesser spotted eagle, in which
                              siblicide is obligate, the first-hatched eaglet pecks
                              its younger sibling to death every time. 1 Presum­
                              ably, parents laid that extra egg as a form of insur­
                              ance, in case the first was defective, succumbed to
disease, or was lost to predators.
   Older chicks benefit the most from staggered hatching. By producing suc­
cessful progeny, parents benefit as well. Hence parents remain astoundingly
nonchalant, never intervening as older chicks peck younger ones to death.
The losers are the last-hatched chicks, scarcely in a position to do anything
about it beyond waiting for a miracle . (It's remotely possible, even at this
stage, that the older might suffer a mishap.)
   In some siblicidal species (like egrets) one or more chicks arc only some­
times killed, if food is short. Death results from older chicks bullying weaker
ones, who become so intimidated that they starve. In other siblicidal species,
several eggs are laid and all but one of these hatchlings are invariably killed.
These obligately siblicidal species tend to be large carnivorous birds, such as
eagles, pelicans, cranes, boobies, and penguins. To qualify for the scientific
definition of an "obligately siblicidal" species, 90 percent or more of all
broods produced must be reduced. 2 Normally, the last-hatched chick would
survive only if it was reared as a replacement for an alpha chick. 3
   The longer the interval between the laying of the first egg and the last one,
the longer an insurance egg will be on hand to pinch-hit if needed, and the
longer the first-hatched has to grow larger than the runt. With that head
start, termination of the underling by the bully can occur swiftly and, from
the point of view of parents and surviving chick, efficiently. 4 But in species
where death of laterborns is by no means preordained, if food turns out to he
abundant, parents rear the whole brood. 5
                           WHY    BE ADORABLE?                               443
    Exaggerate Inequalities? or Minimize Them?
Presumably it was energy constraints and the risk of maternal overcommit­
ment that initially fayored mother birds who spaced egg-laying over a span of
days. Once established, this staggered laying of eggs that would hatch asyn­
chronously set the stage for the first-hatched offspring to prevail over
younger ones. At that point, there was an opportunity for natural selection to
favor parental behaviors that either exacerbated or else mitigated the result­
ing inequalities between siblings. For example, by beginning to brood the
first egg right away, the mother ensures that the first-laid will hatch before
her other eggs. Among some birds, mothers have been selected to further tip
the scales in favor of elder bullies by depositing an extra dose of aggression­
enhancing androgens in the yolks of the first-laid eggs. From there, the chicks
peck it out to the preordained outcome, while parents remain aloof from the
fray.6
    Other birds, however, like my friends the coots, opt instead to equalize
rather than exacerbate the odds, permitting smaller chicks to coexist with older
rivals. Instead of allowing the stronger to prevail, coot parents compensate
for the competitive weakness of later-horns by preferentially feeding them.
Among the coot chicks, fancy neonatal plumage metamorphoses gradually,
over the space of three weeks, into the less conspicuous and safer regulation­
gray adult uniform, providing parents with an accurate index of how old the
chick is. By favoring the fanciest, parents make sure of feeding the youngest.
As all chicks in the nest gradually dim down with age, turning first Quaker­
gray, then black at maturity, parental preferences for neonatal coloration fade
away as well.
    Coot parents are not the only birds to inadvertently subscribe to such
post-Enlightenment ideals, helping out the under-bird. Canary mothers
equalize investment in offspring through other means. The mothers add extra
testosterone to the yolks of their last eggs. After the eggs hatch, mothers pro­
vide more food to the hungriest rather than the oldest chicks. 7
    As soon as sociobiologist Doug Mock read this report by Hubert Schwab)
about extra testosterone for later-laid canary eggs, he hypothesized that the
cattle egret mothers he studied would manage their broods quite differently.
He had been studying siblicide for years, and had never seen egret parents do
anything to protect the youngest. Collaborating with Schwab), Mock and col­
leagues at the University of Oklahoma discovered that among siblicidal cattle
                                        '
444                     AN INI'ANT S-EYE VIEW
egrets, thefirst egg receives extra androgens. Mock and colleagues speculate
that the steroid boost enhances aggressiveness and further facilitates domina­
tion of later-born chicks by elder siblings. But could the unequal steroid serv­
ings be a coincidence? Mock's observation that mothers provide the same
amount of androgen content to each of their sequentially produced eggs in a
different egret species not characterized by siblicide makes this possibility
less likely.
    The implications are unsettling. If parental bolstering of bullies in the sib­
licidal birds is no coincidence, it suggests that the intensity and outcome of
sibling rivalry is indirectly being set up by parents. Even given a physiologi­
cally imposed interval between laying her eggs, it's still up to the mother
whether she hegins brooding the first egg right away or waits till everyone is
present so eggs will hatch at the same time. It's also up to the mother to
deposit the same or different amounts of aggression-increasing hormones in
each chick.
    What Appeals to Parents?
Mother Nature's "bad habits" include not just acting ruthlessly, but striking
early at the weak. Sometimes parents themselves become the agents of selec­
tion, biasing the survival of immatures in line with parental interests. In this
way, parents magnify the effects of ordinary natural selection. By preferen­
tially feeding the youngest, however, coot parents (like canaries) are opting
for equity-even to the point of compensating for weakness. This creates
new selection pressures on the young. W ith half or more of each clutch suc­
cumbing to starvation, any trait that makes it likely that a hatchling will
receive more food will be strongly selected for. It may be selected for even if
that trait happens to he looking more helpless.
    It was a team of three behavioral ecologists-Bruce Lyon, John Eadie, and
Linda Hamilton-who discovered that coot parents preferentially deliver
food to the youngest-looking (neediest) chicks. But how did parents "know"?
Were there particular traits that appealed to parents? They postulated that
what must have begun as modest differences between adults and hatchlings
(perhaps, the tendency for chicks in all species of coots to hatch sporting a
bare spot on their head) combined with a reliable alarm signal emitted by a
chick in need (the skin of a chick in any kind of distress flushes red) had
become perpetuated and magnified. Parents who responded to such distress
signals had a higher proportion of chicks survive. As parents provided more
                          WHY      BE   ADORABLE?                              44.)
food to chicks with balder, redder heads, redness itself became an attractive
trait. Thus chicks that hatched with the baldest, reddest heads were more
likely to survive and pass on these traits. Here "survival of the fittest" meant
survival of those who looked youngest and neediest, even though they were
still vigorous enough to beg. Sure enough, experiments revealed that coot
parents preferentially fed the most brightly colored chicks. 8 (See Plate 2.)
    Because parents exercise preferences among offspring, offspring arc
selected to display those traits that catch their attention, leading to such exag­
gerated signals as the huge, gaping (sometimes elaborately marked) mouths
of baby birds. Over generations, in a process similar to the peafowl's prefer­
ence for a peacock's tail, flamboyant neonates were preferred by parents. The
payoff for the flamboyant chick is not greater breeding success for the attrac­
tive, as in classic sexual selection, but survival of the attractive chick long
enough to show off another day, that other way. More than feathers make the
bird. Success depends on parental preferences for a particular look.9
    Runaway Selection for Infantile Traits
Like the more famous case of sexual selection through female choice of a
male with fancy feathers, "parental choice" has the potential to spark "run­
away selection."10 If parents prefer fancy chicks, those parents who preferred
them are selected for. Their surviving offspring would be disproportionately
fancy, and also grow up to be parents who both prefer and produce appropri­
ately fancy chicks. Selection is simultaneously favoring chicks with the trait
and parents who possess preferences for it. I return to this topic of runaway
selection when I discuss the possibility that maternal preferences contributed
to selection for fatter babies in the course of human evolution.
    Natal Attractions in Primates
Early on, William Hamilton proposed that sexual selection has shaped our
aesthetic sensibilities. Displaying his own poetic gift (a talent, like singing,
that some have suggested evolved in men because of its appeal to members of
the opposite sex), Hamilton wrote that sexual selection probably"plays a part
in making us all so over-intellectualized as to love our bright and capricious
world as we do, so far beyond any utility to us." But if Hamilton is right, adult
preferences for specific infantile traits must also have shaped human tastes in
colors, shapes, and textures (big-headed, cute, soft, paler skinned, and just
generally neotenous, or"baby-like").11
                                        '
                        AN   INFANT       S-EYE    VIEW
    It should come as no surprise that birds are not the only ones to enter the
world in fancy dress. Some of our primate relatives are also born as if dressed
in spun gold or dusted in snow. At the top of this list are the orange-gold
babies born to dusky leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus obscurus). Glistening golden
babies stare out at the world through eyes rimmed by large, chalk-white cir­
cles; so remarkable is their costume, that the world can only stare back, agog.
(See Plate 3.) Perhaps for this reason, natal coats have more often been a sub­
ject of amazement than of study. Little research has been done on primate
             12
natal coats.
    High in the canopy of Malaysian forests, these resplendent golden T. obscu­
rus infants are anything but "obscure," although the dusky gray adults are. The
new babies stand out brilliantly against their mothers' bodies, visible half a
mile away. More spectacular still are the "crucifer patterns" embellishing the
natal coats of their Sumatran relations, the mitered leaf monkey. Neonates
are born white with a dark stripe from head to tail-tip, crossed by another
stripe between the shoulders, in a cross pattern resembling a heraldic
emblem-or, as in Hose's leaf monkey of Borneo, just white with a simple
dark stripe . What on earth could such decorations be for?
    Most mammals, if they can't hide their babies in burrows, at least camou­
flage them, giving birth to fawns with spotted coats that disappear in the high
grass of their hideaways . Others are camouflaged by blending into their
mother's mottled fur, as in the case of baby koala bears, marmosets, and
orangutans. Borrowing a bit of the best of both worlds, many cercopithecine
monkeys-like baboons and vcrvet monkeys-are born like lawyers, in dis­
creet black suits, just different enough from adults to give babies a discrete
uniform without screaming "Baby on Board"-discrcet but discrete . The
more terrestrial relatives of the leaf-eaters (Hanuman langurs and proboscis
monkeys) also tend to dress down, or at least to limit the broadcast of their
more flamboyant signals, so as to bypass the unwelcome attention of preda­
tors hut still he able to selectively advertise neonativity. Gray Hanuman lan­
gur monkeys arc horn all black except for the flamingo-pink skin of their
face, while proboscis monkey babies arc colored like their parents except for
a Druid-blue face, which they direct toward those whose attentions they
desire .
    But exactly whose attentions arc desired? What possible survival advan­
tage could outweigh the disadvantage of being so visible to hawks, eagles, and
other enemies? Could it be that infant primates horn impractically ornate

evoked this way so as to attract more care from mothers? But since they were
horn to single-mindedly devoted Old World monkey mothers, why on earth
would they need to? In the absence of competition with other similarly
endowed siblings, how could the coot-caliber flamboyance of all these snow­
white, gold, and hluc-faced babies evolve? Given that their mothers bore only
one baby at a time, who were the ancestors of all these babies competing with
that thev needed to dress-to-he-noticed?
         J
    Why Be a Flamboyant Baby?
Recall that monkey mothers arc paragons of unconditional love. Unlike
siblicidal egrets (and some humans), but like coots and canaries (and other
humans), monkey and ape mothers compensate for infant disabilities rather
than discriminate against the weak. Among the anthropoid primates, only
human mothers are the odd-primates-out in this respect, since human moth­
ers do discriminate on the basis of offspring attributes.
    Gh·en how unconditional the "love" of mother monkeys and apes typically
is, what possible selection pressure to be "flamboyant" could outweigh evi­
dent costs to baby colobus and leaf-eating monkeys of evolving conspicuous
natal coats? To solve this mystery, we need to widen our field of vision to
encompass other females, not just the genetic mother. Unlike that of the
coots, flamboyant natal dress in primates did not evolve to elicit care from
parents. It evolved as a natal attraction, screaming "New Baby" to all benevo­
lent alloparents in the vicinity.
    Recall that most monkey and ape mothers are exceedingly possessive of
newborns, but with many exceptions . Prime among these are the "infant­
sharing" species, many of them belonging to the subfamily Colobinae.
Colobine monkeys are characterized by large many-chambered stomachs­
sacculated guts, of the sort cows and other ruminants have-where anaero­
bic bacteria break down cellulose. T his ability to digest large quantities of
tough fiber permits these monkeys to live off leaves when flowers or fruits
are unavai1able. Along with the high degree of relatedness among group
members typical of species that live in small, one-male groups, there is a ten­
dency among colobines for female-dominance hierarchies to be less rigid
than among macaques or baboons.
    Mothers in these easygoing colobine societies feel comfortable turning
over their infants within hours of births and allowing their female kin to carry
them about-in langur monkeys, for about half of all daylight hours. Prima-
                                        '
                       AN    INFANT       S-EYE     VIEW
tologists had long suspected that mothers freed to forage would be better fed
and better able to produce milk. Their babies would thus be better nour­
ished as well-a "trickle-down" argument familiar (if not always completely
convincing) to every ambitious working mother who rationalizes leaving her
infant in daycare while she seeks a better life for her family. It was very satis­
fying, then, when John Mitani (at Yale) and David Watts (at the University of
Michigan) used comparative data from a broad array of primates with and
without infant-sharing to show that babies born to infant-sharers grow at a
faster rate, and that their mothers give birth again after much shorter inter­
vals without compromising their own health or infant survival. Crudely put,
mothers with good daycare had the highest fertility rates.
    Do Humans Have Natal Coats?
Flamboyant natal coats in primates no longer seem such a mystery. Conspicu­
ously garbed babies do not (like coots) compete with sibs in the same clutch
for parental attention, but instead compete with all the other just-born
infants in their cohort to attract the attention of allomaternal caretakers. Just
as coot parents favor the youngest chick in their clutch, primate allomothers
prefer the youngest, most "neonatal-looking" infant in their troop. The
younger the baby, the more times per minute allomothers attempt to handle
it. The more time they carry it, the more the mother gets to feed. Both
mother and infant benefit as a result. It sounds like a system humans could
use. Did they?
    Human babies are indeed adorable, especially to those of us culturally as
well as biologically primed to see them so. W hen I look back at photographs
of my own babies right after birth, squench-faced and puckered, I am as­
tounded at how homely they are compared to my recollection that each was
the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. The eye of the maternal beholder
notwithstanding, nothing about human newborns broadcasts signals nearly so
conspicuous at a distance as the bright golden coat of a dusky leaf monkey
baby or a snow-white colobus newborn would do.
    Human neonatal signals seem more tailored to local consumption. Our
dowdy species enters the world covered with barely detectable whorls of fine
hairs called lanugo. Otherwise, we arc as furless as our parents in whose eyes
naked babies arc nonetheless luscious. At birth, all Caucasian babies have blue
eyes, while the eyes of African babies arc almost colorless. !Kung newborns,
Mongolians, and the Native American descendants of Mongolian peoples
                            WHY      BE  ADORABLE?                             449
often have clusters of dark pigment at the base of their newborn spines,
detectable upon close inspection. Otherwise, the human infant's color
scheme is some blend of its parents', albeit often a traumatized purple right
after birth, or a jaundic<.'d p<-'achy hue. For some months after emerging into
the light of day, most babies arc paler than adult phenotypes. But for the most
part, human primates arc horn the same color as their parents.
    Our newborns are visibly different from grown-ups. But they emit no
special long-distance signals (apart from vocal ones, like crying). Human
babies arc not a hit flamboyant-as if they were horn so confident of matcr­
nal love that they have no need to attract attention from anyone else. Yet from
ethnographies, classical accounts, the archives of foundling homes, down to
today's tabloids-humankind's record is far from reassuring. Realistically,
babies have few guarantees that mothers will care for them.
    Sad truth to tell, millions of babies horn to our species could have used
some magically irresistible natal garb to attract the kindness of allomothers.
There is all too great a risk that the proverbial magnetic attraction of baby
primates doesn't always work in Homo sapiens. Among monkeys, the younger
or more "neonatal" they look, the more attractive they are. Yet exactly the oppo­
site is the case among humans. Babies right after birth are at the greatest risk of
maternal abandonment or infanticide.
Something had to change radically for a primate mother ever to find a very
new baby, right after birth, less attractive than an older, weaned, or nearly
weaned one. Yet the record is clear: among humans, very new babies arc
more likc1y to be abandoned, or even killed, than their older siblings arc.
    What changed, of course-though we can't say exactly when it began-is
that human babies started to he born after shorter intervals. Apparently
mothers were routinely receiving a message that was different from the one
primate mothers had evolved to read. The message was a decline in her pro­
lactin levels, which the mother read as meaning that her current baby had
ceased to suckle (or was suckling less) and was either mature enough to he
weaned or else dead, and the signal meant time to replace it. The trouble was,
that in the new context in which human mothers found themselves, her baby
was neither dead nor mature. Rather, the baby was suckling less because it
was partially subsisting on porridge or animal milk, and spending time apart,
                                        '
                       AN    INFANT S-EYE            VlEW
swaddled perhaps on a board, or rocking in a cradle. Possibly it was held by
allomothers. Such an infant might not be taking such frequent swigs at the
nipple as previously, but he or she remained very dependent indeed. Thus
many mothers were ending up with a new baby on top of a current baby who
was still dependent.
     When organisms must cope with new situations, all Mother Nature has at
hand are the leftovers in the cupboard. Mutations are rarely any use. This is
why the most rapid adaptations tend to be behavioral rather than physiologi­
cal. Individuals use behavior to produce a new phenotype, and subsequently,
at a more leisurely pace, selection for traits that complement and enhance the
new phenotype can be selected for in the conventional Darwinian way.
     In the case of these newly fertile humans, ancient predispositions, left
over from a time when mammalian mothers bore litters and gave birth to
babies that cost less than primate babies do, re-evolved or were reactivated.
Instead of classic primate mothers who care for whatever very new baby they
have at hand, these newly hyperfertile mothers, who found themselves caring
for a clutch of babies of different ages, became more discriminating. It was
more practical to change decision-making by mothers, transforming an
uncritical, unconditionally loving mother monkey, than to modernize the
way a woman's ovaries register incoming information about the status of her
baby's needs. (Basic primate sensibilities still persisted, of course, and that's
one reason why many of the cruel choices human mothers must make are so
fraught with ambivalence.)
     Mothers who tended to be more discriminating about which babies they
cared for fared better. During famine and other crises, selective mothers
would be the only ones who left surviving offspring. More discriminating,
situation-dependent solicitude toward newborns-a common enough trait
among litter-bearing mammals-reemerged. (A still unexamined question is
whether nonhuman primate mothers in a pinch would respond to hyperfcr­
tility in the same way. The evidence for twins suggests that an overburdened
mother monkey or ape also makes a choice between infants [sec pages
1 So-81 ) . But information remains too sketchy to permit any conclusion.)
    If we arc to believe the record from antiquity (and I do), the behavioral
response to inopportune births was to abandon or terminate care. Hence the
many human infants who were forced to rely on the "kindness of strangers,"
as described in chapter 1 2. Human mothers arc far more likely to abandon
their infants than arc other primates who give birth to one baby at a time.

The single-minded, unconditional devotion c haracteristic of mother mon­
keys and apes contrasts with the more discriminating solicitude of human
mothers in traditional societies and across history. In terms of maternal infan­
ticide and abandonment, humans resemble birds and litter-bearing mammals
more nearly than they do other primates. Although utterly unprimatelike,
infanticidal mothers are not in the least unnatural. Because we take maternal
love for granted, it has rarely occurred even to evolutionists to ask the same
sort of questions about humans that we now routinely ask about coots or
canaries. What effect has discriminative maternal solicitude had on the sur­
vival equipment of human infants, the attributes each infant enters the world
with, and the signals it sends? In the next chapter, which I caution readers is
even more speculative than this one, I attempt to answer this question.

            atural disasters just happen, floods sweeping away anyone in their
            path, epidemics ravaging populations. Neglect or abandonment of
            a child may occur because the mother has little choice. She may be
very young and inexperienced, or she may have too many children already. In
today's world a mother may become a victim of civil war, infected with HIV,
incapacitated by poverty, depression, or"crack." Perhaps her mate has died or
walked out , or strange males have stormed into her group. Such contingen­
cies fall outside of Mother Nature's ruthless sphere, governed by her flighty
sister, the occasionally generous but ever arbitrary Dame Luck.
    Nothing about an embryo atlccts its order of birth in a family. Even sex at
conception is usually a chance outcome of the chromosomal dice. Nor can an
embryo alter environmental conditions that await outside the womb. To this
extent , the hardiness or appeal of a particular baby is irrelevant.

    Bad Luck
When a certain Ache hunter was killed by a jaguar,the deceased left behind a
)'Oung widow big with child. A bachelor named Betapagi, regarded as "ugly"
and a lackluster hunter,began to pay court.He convinced the pregnant girl,
named Pirajugi,to·marry him.When her baby was born in camp a few days
later,all the Ache examined it. Young children crowded close to touch the
baby as their mothers hastily rebuked them and pushed them away.The only
absent band member was Betapagi,who had grabbed his bow and left camp
as soon as his new wife went into labor."The baby was small,and had very lit­
tle hair on its head," noted ethnographers Kim Hill and Magdalena Hurtado.
    The Ache felt little affection for children born without hair.No woman
    volunteered to cradle the baby while the mother recovered from the
    birth.No man stepped forward to cut the umbilical cord.The signs
    were clear,and it took only Kuchingi's [a respected group member's]
    verbal suggestion to settle the point. "Bury the child," he said."It is
    defective,it has no hair." "Besides,it has no father.Betapagi docs not
    want it.He will leave you if you keep it." Pirajugi said nothing,and the
    old woman Kanegi began to dig silently with a broken bow stave.The
    child and placenta were placed in the hole and covered with red sandy
    soil. A few minutes later the Ache packed up their belongings and
    Grandpa Bepurangi began to break a trail through the undergrowth
    with his unstrung bow. Pirajugi was tired,but she had nothing to carry,
    so she was able to keep up without difficulty. Women cried softly as
    they walked through the forest."Ooooooh Kuajy maiechcve....""our
    parents and grandparents who took care of us....     "1
    Kuchingi,the hunter who had first brought Pirajugi the news of her hus­
band's death,and who now advised her to bury their son, was himself no
stranger to such decisions. As a child,his own life had depended upon such a
choice.As Kuchingi explained the circumstances in his own words:
    The one who followed me [in birth order] was killed.It was a short
    birth spacing. My mother killed him because I was [still] small. "You
    won't have enough milk for the older one," she was told."You must
    feed the older onc."Then she killed my brother,the one who was born
    after me.2

4-54                   AN INFANT S-EYE VIEW
    Probably any infant known to have been sired by the wrong father, or born
at the wrong time, would have suffered a similar fate. Even if born just a bit
larger, or with a bit more hair, another infant would have fared no better. But
not all mortality is random. How robust an infant is, whether innately resis­
tant to a particular disease-these traits surely matter for survival. But
because infants are so peculiarly dependent for survival on the adults around
them, selection also acts throuoh them. How much, or whether, a mother
invests depends in part on her perception of the infant. Mothers who find
themselves between a rock and a hard place sometimes do opt for the hard
place and keep an infant in spite of their predicament.
    The cases I summarize here hint that infant attributes can be exceedingly
important, of life-or-death significance. For unlike other primates, humans
have a conscious capacity to assess outcomes-to predict what costs a partic­
ular infant might impose on the survival of an older sibling, or on family
resources or harmony; to predict how a father or stepfather might behave; to
know ahead of time that the baby's grandmother is about to die and that there
will be no one to help; in short, to mentally run through a store of informa­
tion concerning what has happened in the past to other infants born with this
particular configuration of traits and circumstances and to make a conscious
prognosis for this one. The cognitive capacities that place human infants at
particular risk of maternal neglect or abandonment (compared with other
primates) may also be selecting for particular traits in infants. We need to
understand how maternal criteria helped shape the environment in which
infants evolved.
    Close Calls
German anthropologists Wulf and Grete Schiefenhovel document how a
mother committed to infanticide changed her mind. The events took place
among the Eipo people living on the wet northern slopes of the Central
Cordillera of Papua New Guinea. The particular vigor of an unwanted infant
girl tipped the decision in her favor.
    For decades prior to the arrival of the Schiefenhovcls, in I 974-, the Eipo
population had remained stable. Zero population growth was maintained by
small family sizes-an average of 2.6 children per woman.l Lack of growth
was not due to child mortality, however. For the death rate, fifty per thou­
sand, was far lower than in most developing nations. In spite of the ncar
                            "                                         "

absence of medical facilities, prolonged breast-feeding (up to three years)
ensured that such infants as were kept remained relatively healthy.
    The key to the puzzle was the high rate of infanticide, which was occur­
ring right after birth and in private. When infanticide is taken into account,
Eipo infant mortality rates rise to 48o per thousand.4 Aid workers in other
de,·eloping countries have sometimes speculated that the death of some chil­
dren improves nutritional status of remaining ones, 5 and this was probably
the case among the Eipo.
    Whether or not a mother in this remote horticultural community kept
her infant was up to her. However, each mother would have been acutely
aware of population pressure on the supply of sweet potatoes. A conscious
concern for the future would have entered her calculations.
    Gi\'en that the rate of child mortality in this population was low, and that
infanticide accounted for So percent of what there was, the oft-cited ratio­
nale attributing high rates of infant mortality to maternal indifference did not
fit. Mothers emotionally distancing themselves from doomed babies could
not explain high rates of infanticide among the Eipo. 6 Rather, the deciding
factor was the desire for sons. Mothers who eliminated a daughter were
aware that they would be likely to conceive again within the year, possibly
giving birth the next time to a son. In the early years of the Schiefenhovels'
study, between 1974 and 1978 (before missionaries transformed the lifeways
of the Eipo), 41 percent of all live-born infants were eliminated. Of twenty
infants not kept, five were male and fifteen were female. 7
    The Schiefenhovels tell the story of one woman who during late preg­
nancy "repeatedly and openly stated that she would not accept another baby
girl (because she already had one daughter and no son) ." Prior to birth, then,
the mother mentally prepared herself not to form any bond with the child,
to remain distant at birth . After the birth of a particularly healthy-looking
female , however, "she showed obvious ambivalence."
    Still, without cutting the umbilical cord, leaving the placenta still at­
tached, the mother wrapped the newborn in fern leaves laced with rope
made from Hanas. For a long while, she sat thoughtfully near the bundle. The
infant screamed lustily, struggling to live, her pudgy hands and feet bursting
out through the leaves. Eventually, the mother departed, leaving the infant
where she lay. Yet she did not throw the bundle into the bushes as would be
typical in an Eipo infanticide.

    Arbitrariness of Criteria Defining Human Life
Inspecting the newborn is one of the few behaviors mothers everywhere
engage in. Like other primates, a human mother pays special attention to the
                                                                        "

genitals. She may delicately run her hands over the entire body. Unlike other
primates, however, the human mother compares her baby with cultural
ideals. Quite arbitrary standards-a blend of traits linked (or once linked) to
viability, along with current fashion, family needs, or just whimsy-can have
lasting repercussions for the way a mother relates to her infant.
    Nowhere is such arbitrariness more evident than in debates over just
when life begins. Even groups with similar cultural legacies exhibit big differ­
ences. Not long ago a painful inter national incident occurred when it was
revealed in the United States that personnel working in an East German
maternity ward defined any neonate smaller than 2. 2 pounds as fetus rather
than baby, and disposed of them in a bucket of water. 9 In the ensuing contro­
versy, neither side would give way. Leaving aside differences in medical tech­
nology and available resources, the problem was that biologically, there is no
set point where life obviously begins. Answers must alway s be relevant to cir­
cumstances.
    The criteria for what mothers consider acceptable or desirable in a baby
vary with available resources and probable outcomes. Yet this being acknowl­
edged, there do seem to be traits in newborns that all mothers are especially
attuned to. Not surprisingly these are traits that have traditionally been good
predictors of survival. Hardiness registers, as do signs of vigor. Assessment
begins with the first cries of a just-born baby.
    Factors Affecting Maternal Assessment
Some maternal likes and dislikes have an innate component. Certain kinds of
cries, for example, given by premature infants seem to be universally disturb­
ing, even aversive, while rounded heads and plump features are universally
appealing. The sight of a defective newborn is profoundly disturbing. Even
                                                                              10
low-birth-weight babies are distressing and generate psy chological distress.
In many postindustrial Western societies today we suppress these responses.
It is considered grossly insensitive to mention them.
     Post-Enlightenment sensibilities about children, combined with the old
assumption that all normal mothers automatically respond to their infants in
a nurturing way (or, as Erich Fromm put it, "Motherly love is by its nature
unconditional"), has meant that very little research has been done on which
infantile traits engage mothers. We know even less about which ones disturb
or repel them.
     Yet based on the handful of studies where researchers have looked in this
                                         '
                       AN    INFANT S-EYE            VIEW
direction, maternal commitment does appear to be sensitive to certain fetal
and neonatal attributes. In a I 9 9 I study, Canadian researchers documented a
change in pregnant women's attitudes toward impending birth once they
were told that the baby they were carrying was normal . By using chorionic
villus sampling, which can be done earlier than amniocentesis, an increased
sense of attachment to the not-yet-born baby was documented.11 Further
evidence that mothers may be more hesitant to fully commit to babies whose
survival is in doubt is suggested by maternal responses to premature babies.
The delicate and wizened facial features of infants born preterm are less
likely to be rated as "babyish," or attractive, and less likely to elicit nurturing
responses than are the rounded heads and plump cheeks of full-term infants.
For mothers with plenty of support, such initial reactions are not going to
                                                                         2
compromise care, but the risk of maternal distancing is still there. 1
    Some of the traits mothers attend to are only indirectly linked to survival
prospects. For example, a great deal of attention is paid to whom the infant is
thought to resemble. Mothers may be particularly interested in increasing a
husband's confidence in paternity, and concerned when physical attributes of
the baby threaten to undermine that. Father's perceptions on this point may
influence whether or not he stays and continues to invest in a particular wife
and her children, how much time he spends near the infant, and how much
help he provides. An infant's physical appearance-skin and hair color, and
eventually eye color-may raise confidence of paternity or further fuel a
 tather's" susp1c1ons.

    Shakespeare's grisliest play, Titus Andronicus, provides a stark example . The
empress of Rome has just given birth to a dark-skinned baby who more
nearly resembles her lover-Aaron the Moor-than he does his father, the
emperor. "Here is this babe," moans the nursemaid, "as loathsome as a toad
amongst the fair-faced breeders of our clime." Hence the mother beseeches
her lover to destroy the telltale evidence of her infidelity, something (as we
will see) Aaron is loath to do.
    Turning to a less dramatic real-life example, psychologists Martin Daly
and Margo Wilson report the tendency of people (especially mothers) in hos­
pital delivery rooms to spontaneously tell fathers that their babies look like
them. But even the sociobiologists doing these studies simply assumed that
well-wishers were being polite, softening Dad up for future duty. After all,
we know that babies at birth resemble other babies (especially their siblings
at the same life stage) more nearly than they do either parent. However, a

affect the child's qualities. Emphasis on fetal education is, if anything, even more pronounced today owing to the one-child policy. One woman inter­

preliminary report that facial features in year-old babies are more likely to
resemble those of their fathers than their mothers raises the intriguing possi­
bility that a baby's facial morphology is especially responsive to genetic input
from the father. This finding still needs to be replicated. Should it hold up,
genetic imprinting of the kind studied by David Haig would be a possible can­
didate mechanism to explain it. 13
     Among the handful of researchers to tread-very cautiously-in this
highly sensitive, scientifically almost taboo, realm of parental preferences is
psychologist Janet Mann. Mann undertook a longitudinal study of fourteen
twins born at extremely low birth weights. Eight months after mothers
brought the twins home from the hospital, all seven mothers in this small
sample were directing more attention to the healthier twin of the pair, even
though in several of these cases remedial care for the sicker of two twins was
also being provided. Mann, who hastens to qualify her data as preliminary,
hypothesized that mothers have an innate template for assessing infant qual­
ity, based on physical appearance and cries.
     Innate responses to infant appearance cannot by themselves explain the
full range of maternal reactions, certainly not the cases where full-term,
seemingly perfect babies are abandoned, or the many modern mothers who

throw themselves utterly and wholeheartedly into the care of babies unlikely
to survive. Relevant factors to take into account include the mother's social
and economic circumstances, religious beliefs, as well as learned attitudes
about children and about how families "should be."
    In contemporary Western society, parents are respected and admired for
caring for the same infants that in other societies mothers would be con­
demned by their neighbors for not disposing of. Some adopting parents in the
West go out of their way to select the neediest infants, and commit them­
selves to years of therapy on behalf of children who will never repay that care
in any material sense. Unlike other animals, humans are able to consciously
make choices counter to their self-interest. Indeed, much of what we con­
sider "ethical behavior" falls in this category.
    Such voluntary behavior counter to all biological self-interest is what
qualifies as true heroism, moral heroism of the kind George Eliot had in mind
when she distinguished humans from Darwin's "silly animals" and noted that
our deeds determine us as much as we determine our deeds. Such acts make
it awkward for even the most hard-core materialists to completely discount
the existence of free will, and I have no desire to.
    Effects of Baby's Signals on Survival
A mother's standards may be higher or lower, depending on availability of
resources; her age; what other opportunities to have a child she would be
likely to have; on just how much she wants a son; or whether, if she already
has three sons, she prefers a daughter. Or she may not want any infant at all at
that time.
    As a mother scrutinizes her just-born baby, what she sees depends in part
on her culture and circumstances, on what she wants and expects. How a
mother responds to what she sees, whether her love deepens or she pulls
away, in turn affects who a child becomes, whether it prospers or fails to.
    Children whose mothers draw back emotionally often fail to thrive. Some
literally quit growing. Survival chances fall when mothers distance them­
selves from preterm or malnourished children. Downward spirals ensue as
mothers convince themselves that this small-for-its-age, increasingly apa­
thetic, increasingly isolated child docs not desire to cat. On the other hand,
displaying too much appetite can also be lethal. Among Datoga pastoralists
in East Africa, babies who appear to he always hungry risk the diagnosis
that their mother produces insufficient milk. Such babies will be weaned
                                                                       "

posthaste and thereby exposed to potentially lethal new pathogens and
           14
stressors.
    Growth is not easily disentangled from love. In one recent study of moth­
ers and full-term infants in a low-income, high-risk population in Santiago,
Chile, the infants who appeared adequately nourished were more likely to
haYc been classified as securely attached to their mothers (using Ainsworth's
strange situation test) than were infants who failed to gain weight normally
for their age. Ninety-three percent of children falling behind in growth had
previously been classified as anxiously attached. 15
    In the most extreme cases, the way a mother conceptualizes her baby may
determine whether it survives at all. This conclusion was not anticipated
when the psychiatrist Marten DeVries set out to study temperament among
Masai pastoralists in Kenya.
    DeVries arrived in Kenya at the height of a ten-year drought. In a pastoral­
ist community such as the Masai's, when pregnant cows and their suckling
calves starve from lack of forage, the milk supply will be diminished for at
least a year before surviving cows give birth again and lactate. Children and
infants are the first in the population to starve, especially in a case like this
one, where the majority of children were already malnourished. During this
particular famine, infant mortality rose to almost )o percent. Of thirteen
newborn infants registered in the initial study population, DeVries could
locate only six of them by the end of his study; the others had all died. Amaz­
ingly, only one of the six infants with difficult, "fussy" temperaments had
                                                                16
died; five of the seven with "easy" temperaments had done so.
    DeVries's results might have been obtained by chance. Or, perhaps the
"easy" babies were already weak. But I accept his explanation: under stress
from famine, it was easier for the mother to neglect an undemanding baby.
    Whene,·er a Masai infant frets, the mother takes him up and soothes the
baby at her breast. Hence the babies who complained the most were put on
the nipple more. They stimulated more milk production and fed more. The
"squeaky wheels" got the milk.
    Worlds away, Western parents find themselves staggered by the staying
power (and seeming maladaptiveness) of whining offspring, unquietable be­
yond reason. Writer Anna Quindlen can even wax witty about it. "Who was it
coined that old saw about God making them so cute so we will not kill them?
It has particular resonance at 4 A.M."17 Such parents might do well to con­
template the catastrophic famines and die-offs, the long-ago bottlenecks, nar-

row as a birth canal, through which some babies just squeezed. In our not so
distant evolutionary past, some forms of"obnoxiousness" signaled"vigor."
    Still and all, under duress, infants do well to toe a fine line between signal­
ing their distress and appearing too needy. Though a certain quantum of dis­
tress is likely to trigger a succoring response, signaling distress could prove
risky for a baby whose mother is ambivalent. Instead of being classified as
"vigorous," or eliciting a rush of compassion, a complaining baby might
inspire an aversive reaction in a mother who perceives her baby as overly
demanding, or, worse still, who defines her baby as sickly, "doomed," less
                                  18
worthy of further investment.
    Directional Selection
Some infants find themselves held less or fed less than others, or left with
someone other than their mother to rear. T he unluckiest will be abandoned
altogether. But how often in the past would such patterns have had to occur
to have an impact on the way infants are?There is more than one answer.
    When infant mortality in the natural world runs very high and the pattern
influencing which babies die is biased in a consistent way-as was true in the
example of frog egg clutches that failed to hatch early enough to evade preda­
tion-the "blind but efficient . . . daemon" of Darwinian selection will not
be far behind. Such "directional" selection can produce evolutionary change
even more rapidly than Darwin-and most evolutionary biologists as
recently as ten years ago-dreamed possible. 19 But even if, as in the example
at hand, predation by snakes had been less common--say, only � percent of
clutches destroyed-evasive adaptations could have evolved (albeit over
many more generations), so /on9 as selection operated consistently in the same
direction. When catastrophe forces a population through a bottleneck, the
whole process of transforming gene frequencies speeds up.
Population crashes followed by subsequent expansion and migration, or else
 migrations followed by explosions, were precisely the conditions attending
human evolution. Bottlenecks characterized our expansion in fits and starts
around the globe. Traces of prehistoric bottlenecks can still be detected today
in the genetic variation (or lack thereof) found in samples analyzed by Henry
                           "                                             "

would haYe fluctuated many times. There would have been several steps back­
ward for every three forward. Wherever famine was implicated, the toll
would haYe fallen heavily on those least able to defend themselves and com­
pete for resources-the very young, most especially those just weaned.
    In evolutionary terms all that matters is the genetic composition of those
who survive to breed cifter the last big crash. Only those who squeeze through
the bottleneck contribute to the composition of the future gene pool. Many
(most?) of these bottlenecks would have coincided with hard times when
mothers did not have the luxury of rearing every baby that they bore.
    It is tempting, and certainly much less troubling, to overlook how heavily
selection must have fallen on human immatures. When on top of ordinary
selection pressures parents are also assessing infants, making conscious prog­
noses, and investing accordingly, the weight of selection against immatures is
magnified in specific ways.
    Scrutinizing newborn group members is a primate universal. But con­
sciously deciding whether or not to keep a baby is uniquely human. For mid­
wh·es and educated parents living in the Greco- Roman world of the second
century A.D., the Greek physician Soranus was the Berry Brazelton of his day,
albeit a Brazelton with an edge .
    Gynaecology, Soranus's influential text on the care of the newborn, in­
structs midwives to announce to the parents the sex of the infant, then to
proceed with a physical exam to determine whether or not this newborn was
"worth rearing." Soranus wanted to know: Was the mother healthy during the
pregnancy? Is the infant well formed? Does it respond well to sensory stimu­
lation? Cry normally? Is the infant full-term and neurologically normal?Two
thousand years later, Martin Daly and Margo Wilson independently arrived at
the very same criteria for what, iftheir only concern was reproductive success, par­
ents should take into account in their "initial assessment of the newborn's fit­
ness prospects."20

    Viability Tests
In some cultures, parents go further, subjecting infants to specific tests of via­
bility. Soranus was aware of such practices among European barbarians and
vehemently disapproved. Born in Ephesus, and practicing medicine first in
Alexandria, then in Rome, Soranus had a broad knowledge of such customs.
Among Germans, Scythians, and even some civilized Greeks (which appar­
ently surprised Soranus), newborns were subjected to icy-cold baths to
toughen them, and also to test them "in order to let die, as not worth rearing,
one that cannot bear the chilling."
    In earlier times, Aristotle had recommended chilling as "an excellent prac­
tice" to toughen newborns, and "accustom children to the cold from their
earliest years." Such customs persisted in parts of Europe through medieval
times. Similar traditions arose, apparently independently, in highland South
America as well as in more tropical climes. Among some West African tribes,
parents bathed babies in cold streams and then swung them to dry in the
chill morning air. 21 As Soranus pointed out, only the "most resistant" would
be likely to survive such an ordeal. Preterm or underweight babies, those
already weak, more than likely would not. Soranus's primary objection was
that the test was too stringent; even infants "worth rearing" would be put at
risk. Nevertheless, neonatal ordeals persisted in medieval Europe for many
centuries more, becoming intermingled with Christian rites.
    Universally, people use myth to make sense of their world. Myths are
especially useful for reconciling discrepancies between a widely held world­
view and anomalous things in the real world that don't quite fit into accepted
categories, things that would otherwise be disturbing. With the spread of
Christianity, longstanding Norse, Greek, Germanic, and Celtic traditions for
disposing of unwanted infants had become deeply disturbing indeed. The new
religion held it sinful. Since the early Middle Ages, the Christian Church has
actively denounced infanticide. From the thirteenth century onward, it be­
came a crime tried by lay judges as well as a sin condemned by the Church.
Parents grew increasingly uneasy about pursuing the old customs. Yet they
also remained reluctant to rear infants they did not want or that they deemed
unlikely to prosper.
    Parents were caught between conflicting prescriptions, between newly
introduced Christian doctrine and old customs for testing infant viability.

                                reclassified by parents as something other than

their way in and pulled baby out, leaving another all made of ice," a haunting
tale derived in part from an eighteenth-century story collected by the Broth­
ers Grimm:
    Fairies stole a mother's child from its cradle and in its place laid a
    changeling with a big head and staring eyes who wanted to do nothing
    but cat and drink. . . . The neighbor told her to take the changeling
    into the kitchen, set it on the stove and make a fire and boil water
    in two egg-shells; this would make the changeling laugh, and if he
    laughed, that would be an end of him.22
    At the surprising sight of water boiling in an eggshell, the baby laughs, so
the fairies are forced to return the human baby and take back its changeling
substitute. In Sendak's version, the baby, "who lay cozy in an eggshell, croon­
ing and clapping as a baby should," is identifiable as the real human baby.
    In real life, as in folklore, people convinced themselves that sickly babies
were impostors left by goblins in place of healthy ones. The infant left behind
became an erifant chanoe in France, a Wechselbao in Germany, in England a
"fairy child" or changeling. In the best known versions from northern
Europe, changelings were left overnight in the forest. If the fairies refused to
take it back, the changeling would die during the night-but since it was not
human, no infanticide could have occurred. If by a miracle the exposed baby

                                      superstitions           seeped     into   "Christian"
                                      practices. Among the best known exam­
                                      ples is the twelfth-century French cult of
                                      the Holy Greyhound that grew up around
                                      Saint Guinefort, the healer of children,
                                      who       was      worshiped till quite recent
                                      times. Shrines to Saint Guinefort were
                                      forested locations where babies suspected
of being changelings could be left overnight.
     The cult of the Holy Greyhound grew up around the legend of a loyal fam­
ily dog unjustly slain by its master. In one version, the master misconstrues
events when he finds blood on the dog's muzzle. But the dog was no predator.
He had been bloodied while protecting the man's baby son from a snake. The
father killed the dog, only to find his baby unharmed. Afterward, mothers
brought children who failed to thrive to special locations in the forest associ­
ated with the burial site of this martyred dog.They left their infant overnight
in hopes that the sick baby would either die without further suffering or
recover fully."A Saint Guinefort, pour Ia vie ou pour Ia mort," went one
French incantation to the saint-if not a healthy life, then death. Such cults
persisted into the early twentieth century despite efforts by Church authori­
ties to suppress them. 23
     According to one thirteenth-century definition, a changeling was "a child
who exhausts the milk of several wet nurses but to no avail, for it docs not
grow, and its stomach remains hard and distended             .  ...  "N In his 1405' Treatise
cif Superstitions, Nicolas of Jawor drew on material set down by the Bishop of
Paris two centuries earlier to explain that:" 'changelings' ...are said to be
thin, always crying and unhappy, and so thirsty for milk that no quantity, no
                                  "                                                    "

matter how abundant, could ever satisfy even one of them." It is impossible to
know whether such descriptions apply to children who are malnourished and
dehydrated from illnesses like diarrhea , or perhaps to unwanted infants who
fail to thrive because they are neglected. In her study of"maternal selective
neglect" among impoverished mothers in northeastern Brazil today, anthro­
polog ist Nancy Scheper-Hug hes provides detailed descriptions of such
"doomed" and stigmatized babies, changelings in a contemporary Third
World context whose desperate mothers cannot afford the luxury of trying
to save them. They are said to be"difficult to rear" and to suffer from"child
sickness." As one Brazilian mother told Scheper-Hughes, "They come into the
world with an aversion to life. They are overly sensitive and are soon fed up"
 with what food is given them. Another mother commented on how "It hurts
the mother to sec her baby dc1ay so in dying."
     As late as the seventeenth century, French children "born thin,""rather
smaller than the others," or "who wear out three nurses without getting
plumper and cr y when one handles them" were thought to be the products of

insemination by the devil. Folk beliefs intersected with reality. Between 1 Bso
and 189s there were at least eight judicial inquiries from various parts of
Europe into the death or mistreatment of children believed to be changelings.
In America, cases like the one in New York in 1877 in which Irish immigrant
parents burnt a suspect child still crop up from time to time. 25
    Birth by Stages
In modern Western societies, infants are regarded as fully human the moment
they are born, tagged, blood-tested, footprinted, granted citizenship and
legal rights. Mothers are encouraged to bond with their infant almost imme­
diately and regarded as strange if they do not. It is an efficient and admirable
scheme. It is also, given the full range of human experience, unusual.
    More ty pically (found in 86 percent of societies in one cross-cultural
study ), full human identity is postponed till after some specific postpartum
milestone or rite of passage in which the baby is publicly acknowledged,
given a name, receives a soul. 26 The ancient Greek amphidromia is a classic
naming ritual . Alloparents pick up the baby and carry it around the hearth,
then hand the newly named baby back to the parents, thereafter a full-fledged
member of their community. In an Indian village in Rajasthan, some time
after birth neighbors and kin will gather at a "cradling ceremony" to joy ously
sing songs and sew clothes for the baby. Hijras (sexually ambiguous castrated
men dressed as women) show up to entertain people and bless the baby­
especially if it is a boy. Prior to the late nineteenth century, infanticide would
have been sanctioned before the ceremony, but not after.
    In hunter-gatherer societies, the transition point is early and very simple.
By custom, a !Kung mother goes into the bush alone to give birth. If she
comes hack with the baby, it is recognized and protected as a group member.
However, if she abandons the baby before returning, she is not regarded as
someone who has killed a person.
    Birth rituals may occur right after birth, or months later. They may he cel­
ebrated simply, or with all the fanfare of a cathedral christening. In the major­
ity of cultures, full rights as a group member arc postponed till after
inspection and acceptance of the baby by parents or alloparents who have
committed to rear it. Criteria for acceptance can he very arbitrary, and open
to interpretation. Recall that in some South American trihcs, too much or
too little hair is considered a sign of maternal misconduct, dooming the
neonate-but not necessarily. "This is not a human being, this child has no
              H 0 W        T 0       B E "A N I N F A N T W0 RT H       R E A R I N G "               469
Figs. 2o.6 One consequence of a belief in changelings was that sickly babies would not be reared.
Here Saint Stephen-stolen as a baby (sec color insert, Plate 4) and supposedly suckled by a
white doe-returns to challenge the devil-baby left in his stead. After all those years, the baby

hair," Elena Valero was told by other women after she gave birth among her
Yanamamo captors. "Kill him at once," they said, only to be contradicted by
the husband who had taken Elena. He merely said, "Let her bring him up,
even if he has no hair . . ."and told the women to go away. 27
     In parts of Africa, South America, and in the Pacific Islands, babies born
with teeth, multiple births, or breech births can be viewed as "ill omens" that
prejudice parental acceptance of the baby. Such traits are often susceptible to
interpretation, as illustrated by the case of a West African father who
demanded that his baby, who was born with six fingers, be killed. The mid­
wife, however, ridiculed him for misreading the signs of witchcraft; to her
                                                               28
experienced eye, polydactyly signaled prosperity.
     Passages to personhood may be viewed as more gradual. Among the
Ayoreo, the critical milestone is relatively late . No child is considered com­
pletely human until he can walk . 29 In other societies, milestones range from
                                        '
470                     AN   INFANT S-EYE           VIEW
taking food, beginning to smile (around five weeks), laughing (four to five
months), or cutting teeth. Passage through universal developmental phases
hints at the infant's future potential and also attests to how much investment
has gone to getting an infant to this stage. The mere fact that an infant has sur­
vived long enough to pass these milestones further indicates that someone
has taken responsibility for the child.
    Grief displayed by bereaved parents is often greater if the baby dies c:ifter
naming or after one of these developmental milestones has been passed, sig­
nifying both the emotional bond that has intensified over time, and also the
child's perceived worth. DeVries was struck by the contrast between how
detached, almost nonchalant, Masai mothers were if an infant succumbed
before being named, as compared to the extreme grief-screaming, self­
mutilation, and chaotic racing about-exhibited if death occurred after­
ward. 30 Apparently, passage through the "second birth" marks not only a
public decision to keep the infant but also a change in the emotional tone of
the relationship between mother and infant.
    W hen United States senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan declares that he is
pro-choice but against late-stage abortion because it is too much like infanti­
cide, he is restating the anthropologically obvious. Almost all infanticide in
traditional societies occurs right after birth, and is conceptually identical to
late-stage abortion. 31 Neonaticide is favored over abortion simply because
infanticide is safer for the mother. (Although traditional societies do have
ways to induce abortions, such crude methods as the pregnant woman asking
someone to jump on her stomach, they are neither effective nor anything
approaching safe.) The situation is reversed for societies with Western medi­
cine. Abortion-especially in early stages of pregnancy-is safer for the
mother than giving birth is. No one with other options chooses infanticide.
In no other primate do mothers appear to distinguish between a new baby
and a new baby that will be kept. Nothing is known about when in the course
of hominid evolution such distinctions came to he emphasized. My own guess
is that mothers grew more discriminating as they were increasingly called
upon to simultaneously provide for multiple offspring of different ages. If this
supposition is correct, mothers faced with the prospect of provisioning a
staggered clutch of slow-maturing, highly dependent offspring would already
                            "

haYc been somewhat discriminating prior to the Neolithic. After it, mothers
would haYe become more fastidious still as settled living brought with it birth
internls shorter still . Such mothers would have been among the earliest
intellectuals, enlisting natural history, myth, and ritual to explain anomalies,
justify their actions, and reconcile necessity with emotions. Then, as now,
combining surviYal, maternity, and work confronted mothers with chroni­
cally irreconcilable dilemmas. Emerging belief systems made such dilemmas
easier to bear, as intelligent and increasingly compassionate creatures
imented stories they could live with.
    T he way a mother thought about her fetus would have become integrally
linked with her view of the world generally. Practices such as assigning names
to indh·iduals came linked to a mother's dawning awareness of death and his­
tory. Increasingly, mothers would he able to imagine and articulate what the
future might hold, including what the impact of a new birth might he for her
other children. To a mother giving birth during this dawn-time of humanity,
it would have been critically important not to regard a neonate as having
equal standing with older children.
    One of the earliest reference points for any emerging cosmology would
haYe been the all too obvious connection between childbirth and mortality.
Birth must have seemed a dangerous life stage, rendered more so by the pain
women experience at that time.
    Birth is a perilous time, when the alien, ghostly world of fetuses comes in
contact with the human world. If things go badly during passage of the large­
headed baby through the birth canal, such a ghost might easily claim the
mother's life. It is the neonate that mediates between these worlds and must
remain in limbo after birth till rendered safe, till post-birth rituals mark the
incorporation of something previously nonhuman into the "civilized," as
opposed to supernatural, world. 32
    Belief structures devised to cope with and help explain these experiences
took on a life of their own. Historians, psychologists, and primatologists have
all called attention to the role played by the physiological lag between the
onset of lactation and the mother's emerging sense of unity with her infant.
Some delay in the onset of lactation is built into being a primate. Whether or
not this window is any longer, or any different, in humans is unknown. What
is obviously different, though, is the way cultural concepts have been used to
elaborate this period of grace between a woman post-partum and a full­
fledged lactating mother. 33
                                        '
472                    AN INFANT S-EYE              VIEW
    In eighth-century Holland, for example, among the still-pagan Frisians,
infanticide was permissible, hut only so long as the child had not yet tasted
"earthly food."34This was a common pattern. It is surely no accident that so
many culturally recognized milestones about becoming human specify intake
of nutrients. Once lactation is established, with all its attendant hormonal
changes, the mother is physiologically and emotionally transformed in ways
that make subsequent abandonment of her baby unthinkable.
Anomalies that fall between traditional categories are everywhere supernatu­
rally charged. Centuries after the Age of Reason, hard-to-classify individuals
(a man in drag; an infant speaking in a deep voice) can still make us uncom­
fortable. Aware of this, makers of horror movies often design aliens that look
like fetuses.
    With startling regularity, the fetus has been regarded as dangerously
anomalous, a symbolically charged entity. In the belief systems of many
Maya-speaking people-contemporary descendants of the ancient Maya still
living in southern Mexico and Central America-there exists a complicated
symbolic analogy between making tortillas, their staple food, and making a
baby. Among the Tzotzil Maya of Chiapas, a warm and gracious people whose
folklore I used to study, menstrual blood is thought to be waste, bodily sub­
stances not used in making babies.
    In this symbolic framework, menstrual blood is equivalent to the waste
from the special lime-water mixture that is used throughout Central America
to soak cornmeal before patting the mush into tortillas to be cooked. Like
tortillas, babies arc viewed as essentially raw and uncivilized until cooking
(gestation, and application of civilizing ingredients like salt after birth) brings
them into the realm of human culture. Given this symbolic framework, such
puzzling customs as applying salt and chile to the lips of a just-horn baby sud­
denly make sense. Salt is applied again at baptism, to seal in the baby's soul.
Prior to such ministrations, babies are viewed as anomalous, still linked to
the supernatural world, and less than human. 15
    In modern societies, science and medicine have removed much of the
physical risk from the birth process . So far as genes and tissue arc concerned,
embryo-fetus-baby represents a biological continuum. No distinction can he

a hundred thousand years ago. The ambigu­
ity persists in spite of quite conscious, even

ganda intended to humanize the fetus by, for
example, displaying photographs taken with fiber-optic cameras that show a
near-term fetus inside the womb sucking its thumb. Ultrasound and wide­
ranging neonatal technologies, along with medical advances that constantly
increase a fetus's ability to live outside the womb, not to mention the
increased care and staggering parental and societal investment required for
the exterogestate fetus to survive, are carrying us into novel terrain. There
are no precedents-emotional, conceptual, legal, or otherwise. This is totally
uncharted territory.
    And Baptism?
In the Christian world, dipping a baby in cold water, or sprinkling him with
water, or, in the case of the early Christian Church, total submersion in co1d
water, marks the transformation of a newborn into a community member.
The rite of baptism represents a form of rebirth, or social and spiritual birth,
after the baby's initial debut into the world.
    Nothing is known about the rite of baptism prior to the first century A.D.
Most scholars assume that baptism has to do with purifying, primarily
because ritual immersion was traditionally important in Judaism, as in the
mikvah, a ritual bath taken by Jewish women to purify themselves after men­
struation. Others have suggested that baptism was a substitute for circumci­
sion in Judaism. French social historian Jean-Claude Schmitt offers an

water. If so, baptism would have derived from a rite originally used by par­
ents to set a threshold of viability below which an infant would not be
reared. 36
The question of what determines a woman's reaction to her baby is often
deemed too sensitive to discuss. For some the idea that there might be more
than one possible response is abhorrent. Yet from the little we have learned, it
is clear that people are more drawn to look, or to look longer, at some babies
than others. One typical response would be to say that interest was elicited
because the baby was "cute." But what does that mean?
    What "cute" usually means is: a rounded head, big eyes, and plump
cheeks-all prime criteria toward Soranus's determination of "full term."
These same neotenous traits persist in humans longer than in any other mam­
mals. To some, this suggests that childish appeal coevolved along with mater­
nal ambivalence, as a sort of sweetener, inducing a discriminating mother to
commit. 37 Everywhere, one trait parents pay close attention to is how plump
the baby is.

mals, and unlike any of the other I 7S species of primates, humans arc born
with such substantial stores of white adipose tissue that even a newborn
starved for a week can maintain blood sugar levels still within a normal
range. 1 The baby in the ear thquake would have been at dire risk of dehydra­
tion and hypothermia, but stores of fat made him less dependent on being fed
promptly than almost any other mammal would have been. Whereas new­
born rats or piglets are nearly devoid of fat at birth, and would starve after
just one day of fasting, 2 human milk production (apart from colostrum which
is present in the first twenty-four hours) does not even get under way for two
or three days after birth, sometimes longer.

    Why Are Human Babies So Big and Fat?
Adipose tissue of a full-term human fetus accounts for 16 percent of its
weight at birth. This is proportionally four to eight times more fat than is
found in a baby monkey. Although length of gestation is about the same in
gorillas and humans, the gorilla newborn weighs just over half what a human
baby does. Chimp babies (whose gestations are shorter) are similarly small. 3
    Comparisons of the weight of human newborns relative to that of other
primates indicate that humans are indeed off-scale; they fail to conform to
predicted correlations between neonatal and adult body weights. 4 As the
great primate anatomist Adolph Schultz put it,"Most human babies are born
well padded with a remarkable amount of subcutaneous fat, whereas mon­
keys and apes have very little, so that they look decidedly 'skinny' and horri­
bly wrinkled."5 It would appear that human babies are particularly fat, pre­
sumably because they need fat for something. But what? The puzzle is only
compounded when we recall that human mother's milk has no more fat in it
than does the milk of monkeys and apes. Composition of human milk is the
same low-fat formula found in virtually every other primate. Like theirs, our
milk is dilute, adapted over tens of millions of years for infants that remain in
more-or-less continuous contact with their mothers and suckle at will. By
contrast, the handful of mammals that are born with stores of subcutaneous
fat comparable to humans, such as seals and walruses, produce incredibly rich
milk. The milk of a harp seal mother is up to 2 3 percent fat at the beginning of
lactation, 40 percent fat by the end; the milk of a gray seal is as high as 53 per­
cent fat. Compare that to the paltry 3 to 4 percent fat content in the milk of
monkeys, humans, and other apes. 6
    Aquatic Origins Hypothesis
It was the curious convergence of subcutaneous fat in humans and marine
mammals (along with the seal-like sleekness of"naked apes") that years ago
suggested to Sir Alister Hardy-and to the best-selling author Elaine Mor­
gan, who wrote The Aquatic Ape-that our ancestors evolved to spend large
amounts of time in water. As in blubbery marine mammals, they argued, sub­
cutaneous fat would render human waders and swimmers warm and buoy­
ant. The "aquatic origins" hypothesis has received little support from
anthropologists, yet the puzzle that inspired the speculation still persists.
    As with any bodily curiosity-the functional wings on a flightless bird, for
example-the most obvious possibility is that the fat deposits arc remnants

of some ancestral form. Yet human fat deposits have no known homologues in
the order Primates, meaning that this trait is most likely a special, derived
characteristic that has evolved since the last common ancestor humans shared
with chimps and bonobos. No known feature of fetal metabolism can explain
the last-minute buildup of fat during the final weeks of pregnancy, a buildup
accounting for over half the total energetic costs of pregnancy at that point.
Neonatal fat has all the earmarks of a peculiarly hominid adaptation. But for
what?
      Insulation for Naked Neonates
Apart from the aquatic origins hypothesis, four additional (not mutually
exclusive) hypotheses have been suggested to explain the unique develop­
ment of neonatal fat deposits in human babies. First there is the "insulation
hypothesis." In 1998, the Polish anthropologist Boguslaw Pawlowski pro­
posed that fat provided insulation to protect babies from nighttime cold in a
species that had recently moved to the savanna and slept "naked" and "on the
ground."7 It is not clear, however, why hominids would not be able to solve
this problem behaviorally at least as well as monkeys and other apes do: Ian-
                                          '
                         AN   INFANT        S-EYE       VIEW
gurs, for example, huddle at night to stay warm at high altitudes in the
Himalayas; gorillas and chimps construct sleeping nests.
    Insurance Policies
Secondly, it has been suggested that a larder of stored fat could represent an
insurance policy. If a new mother were indisposed, her infant might have to wait
for her to recover, or if she died, wait for a lactating allomother to come along
and adopt him. But why should humans be under heavier selection pressure in
this respect than other primates? Baby monkeys, too, are orphaned and
adopted, and we know of cases from the wild where allomothers who were
not lactating carried an infant until its sick mother recovered enough to nurse
it herself. 8
    If baby fat is insurance against emergencies, monkeys would also have ben­
efited from putting on a blubbery life vest prior to abandoning their mother's
womb. If fat was useful insurance, other primates should have evolved it long
ago. Yet fat deposits in primate fetuses have never been documented except in
humans. Counterintuitively, hominid babies evolved to be plumper just as
selection pressure was making their births an increasingly tight squeeze. Nar­
rowing of the pelvic canal was one of the tradeoffs quadrupedal, knuckle­
walking ape mothers made in exchange for the energetic savings to be had
from walking upright on two legs, replacing the knuckle-walking shamble of
a chimp with an easy two-legged stride. 9
    If fat provided useful insurance for neonates, it is surprising that this trait
never evolved before. Compared with humans and monkeys, the pelvic open­
ing of Great Ape mothers has ample room to accommodate a bigger head
or fatter shoulders. (For relative proportions refer back to fig. 7. 8.) Great
Apes have room to spare, yet there apparently has been no selection pressure
for ape neonates to stockpile fat prior to birth the way human neonates do.
    Food forThought
This brings us to the third hypothesis, which relies on a uniquely human
need: neonatalfat provides a stockpile , or larder, criticalfor the development iffast­
growing, lipid-guzzling human brains. Over the past four million years, hominid
brains have expanded from around 4�0 cc in apes and australopithecines to a
ponderous 1 ,4oo cc in Homo sapiens. The bulk of our braininess evolved in the
last three hundred thousand years, long after apes became bipedal. By the
time brains were expanding, Homo crectus females had already evolved to be
                             A MATTER       Ol'   l'AT                       479
bigger mothers. 10 Nevertheless, the combination of a narrow birth canal and
big brains cost mothers dearly.
     Brain tissue is very expensive to produce and maintain. As anthropologist
Leslie Aiello of University College London has shown, the demands of this
single greedy m·gan account for more than !)O percent of the total basal meta­
bolic rate of a ba by 11 Gargantuan as it seems (especially to the laboring

mother, whose cervix the compressed cranial case of her baby just manages
to squeeze through), the newborn's brain is only a quarter of what it soon
will be. Continuing to grow at a rapid, almost fetal, rate during the first
months of life, the brain attains nearly yo percent of its final mass within a
year of birth.12 Hence, according to the "food for thought" hypothesis, big­
brained hominids needed extra fat to grow on, like an extra candle on a birth­
day cake .
   .
     Birth weight turns out to be the single best predictor of infant survival. In
a study done fifty years ago, before many of the interventions that are avail­
able today were in use, infant mortality during the first months was still
around one out of twenty births. T hose below the optimum weight (about
eight pounds) and those above it were less likely to survive. Today, this
remains a textbook case illustrating ongoing stabilizing selection.13 Babies
born at low birth weights arc also more prone to neurological impairment,
though caution is required in interpreting this because such babies arc also
more likely to be born to mothers in poor condition.14 Birth weight also
turns out to be a moderately good predictor of certain aspects of health in
                                                        16
adulthood, 15 and of subsequent mental development.

In spite of their long, nine-month gestations, human infants are born at an
earlier phase of development than other primates, probably to accommodate
their disproportionately large heads. 17Yet even with this early expulsion from
the womb, cranial plates still have to compress. To accomplish this, Mother
Nature takes advantage of the sutures already present in the brain cases of
young vertebrates. 18 Slabs pass over one another like drifting continents as
the skull squeezes through the birth canal, leaving newborns with a fontanel,
a temporary "soft spot" where the quadrants of the brain case have not quite
fused.
     Other primates are born precociously able to latch on to their mothers
and support their own body weight within hours of birth; the wiring of their
                                        '
                        AN    INFANT      S-EYE     VIEW
central nervous systems is more nearly complete. Not in humans. Compared
with those of monkeys, human bones are incompletely ossified and still quite
malleable at birth. The cartilaginous hands of human babies are not nearly
sturdy enough to cling for long. For all these reasons, human neonates­
those "exterogestate fetuses"19-are particularly helpless by primate stan­
dards and require full-time carriage by a caretaker to survive.
    The fact that intelligence is probably useful for human success provides
compelling motivation for a mother to "finance" the energetic requirements
of an organ as costly as the brain. How well she supplies her baby's fat stores
may constitute one of the mother's more enduring maternal effects. Emerg­
ing evidence suggests that the enhanced heritability ofiQ found among twins
reared apart is partly due to their shared renatal environment. 20 Interestingly,
                                            p
the slightly lower average IQ scores of twins as a group compared to single­
ton births (not more than seven points), is often attributed to the fact that
twins must share maternal resources in the womb, and hence weigh less at
birth.21
    But none of these observations explains why babies put on so much fat
bifore birth, when they could more safely fatten up '!fter birth. Why should the
baby stockpile fat prior to its treacherous trip through a bipedal mother's nar­
row pelvic canal? So perilous is the prospect of birth that women living in
areas of both West and East Africa deliberately starve themselves during preg­
nancy. In Nepal, women are aware that smoking stunts the baby's size at birth
yet continue, hoping to have a smaller baby and a safer, less painful delivery.
The problem is serious enough and widely reported enough that the United
Nations commissioned an advisory group to study this counterintuitive prac­
tice of"eating down" during pregnancy. 22
    Surely both infant and mother stand to benefit from waiting until after
passage through the birth canal before building up infant fat stores. Why not
develop a lay-away plan whereby the mother puts on even more extra fat so as
to accommodate the needs of the developing brain by delivering lipids in safe
installments after birth? Richer milk has evolved independently in various
mammals, from tree shrews to bears, under a wide range of selective con­
straints. So why not in humans?
    In defiance of so reasonable an arrangement, near term the fetus builds up
a thick layer of fat between the shoulder blades and lays down fat around the
arms and on pudgy hands. This explains why my own babies arrived with a
crease around their wrists that looked like someone tied a string there to
                              A   MATTER         01'   FAT
remind them it ·was time to he born. This se<JUence seems all wrong, like
assembling a model ship and raising the sails bifore putting it in the bottle. 23
    There is, however, a simple solution to the riddle of this masochism, a
mother who makes life difficult for herself by delivering large quantities of
nutrients and fattening up her baby just prior to delivery. We've been watch­
ing the wrong operative: The mother is not responsible for the buildup; the
fetus is.
    As David Haig points out, once placental supply lines are laid down, the
mother no longer controls the Aow of nutrients to her fetus. Between gesta­
tional weeks 24 and 38, the fetus takes advantage of access to maternal food
stores to stockpile lat. Its body composition shifts from 89 percent water and
 I percent lipids, to 76 percent water and I o percent lipids, so that by the
time of birth, fatness is a fetal fait accompli. 2+ Such fatness might provide
insurance, a larder for the developing brain to draw upon.
    This brings us to the fourth hypothesis, albeit one not mutually exclusive
with the other three, because it depends upon the assumption that fat babies
are more viable. From there, the "self-advertising" hypothesis goes a step fur­
ther to include the mother's perception of how viable her baby is. According
to this last hypothesis, neonatalfat not on!J' helps a neonate survive, it advertises
what a aood bet this baby is to survive, be healthy, and enjoyfull neuroloaical develop­
ment. Hypothesis four (or five if we count " aquatic origins") includes the
mother's assessment of her baby among the selection pressures upon infant
attributes. 25
    W hen immatures must compete for nurture (in this case, newborns
would be vying for preference with past and future prospects, older siblings
already born and siblings that might yet be born), selection to appeal to par­
ents takes on a life of its own. Think of the old notion of a "bonny" babe. As the
Oiford Enalish Dictionary reminds us, a "bonny babe" is not just a physically
attractive and appealing one. In its original meaning, the defining feature of a
bonnv .I
         babe is fine size. Remnants of such folk wisdom can be found in the
contemporary practice of sending out birth announcements that inform rela-
tives and friends not only of the baby's sex ami date of birth but of the infant's
weight at birth as well: "It's a boy, seven pounds, ten ounces!"26
    The inclusion of the infant's weight on a birth announcement no longer
seems so strange or arbitrary, merely very quaint and downright ancient.
Birth weight has always prm·ided humans with the readiest available index of
a neonate's prospects for sun·ival and healthy development, including brain
                                         '
                         AN  lNFANT S-EYE           VlEW
development. Even without the benefit of modern medicine, many societies
are aware that low birth weights (especially when associated with prematu­
rity ) are indicative of poor survival prospects.27 As the second-century physi­
cian Soranus observed, "The infant which is suited by nature for rearing will
be distinguished by the fact that his mother has spent the period of pregnancy
in good health ... [and] by the fact that it has been born at the due time,
best at the end of nine months.2    " 8 Longer-term consequences of low birth
weight might also be recognized, as when an observant midwife or shaman
noticed that those born scrawny were prone to respiratory infections (bron­
chitis and pneumonia) and even to die y oung from adult diseases like heart
attack.  29 W here local knowledge informs parental preferences, culture joins
hands with natural selection and magnifies her effects: parental preferences
for bonny babies make it more likely they will prosper.
    If infants could be certain of maternal investment, as almost all Old World
monkey and ape infants born to fully mature mothers could, it would be far
more practical for both parties (in terms of the hazards of delivery) for
a mother to stockpile fat and transfer it to her infant in the form of richer
milk after birth, and give birth, as every other primate does, to streamlined
babies.Instead, mothers expel their big-brained and fat babies at a far less
developed stage of development than is the case in any other primate.
    Unable to count on mothers to commit to them as reliably as newborn
chimps and other primates can, hominid fetuses are under pressure to con­
vince mothers to do so.The more a fetus extracts from its mother prior to
birth, the more pregnancy has already cost her. Fat stores diverted to this
fetus, although nothing close to the final tally, cannot be recouped. Neonatal
fat becomes the equivalent of a coot's fancy natal costume, adipose advertis­
ing in place of colorful signals of neonativity. The message is about irretriev­
able costs that carry with them the promise of a well-endowed product.
    If fat were not actually advantageous (either as survival insurance or as
evidence of the sufficient wherewithal to provision a greedy brain), plump­
ness would probably never have become the object of parental preference.
But once selection for butterballs was under way, the advantage of appear­
ing bonny took on a life of its own, propelled by parents who preferred fat
babies.    Parental preferences enhanced favored offsprings' prospects of
surviving. All four factors-insulation, emergency stores, wherewithal for
greedy brains, and self-advertisement-may be implicated in the puzzle of
plump neonates.Indeed, one could even speculate that parental choice favor-
                            A   MATTER      OF   FAT
ing plump babies selected for babies with even more fat than was essential for
brain growth, relieving some of the constraints that otherwise might have
prevented the evolution of larger and larger brains in the course of human
evolution.
    In this still imaginary scenario, uniquely human neonatal fat deposits tes­
tify to the intensification of parent-offspring conflict (and with it, maternal­
fetal conflict) in Homo sapiens. Like the life-historical changes that occurred
hundreds of thousands of years before (namely, the longer lifespans that
brought with them longer childhoods), this later contribution to humanity's
unique intellectual capacity, all that gray matter, could have had origins more
coincidental than pride in our own brilliance normally leads us to imagine.
Oh yes, having more fat on hand is useful for making better brains, but pay­
offs from cleverness were not the only selection pressure leading to fatter
babies. Some babies were already fatter than they needed to be because some
mothers were discriminating about which babies they cared for.
    The erotic appeal and sheer deliciousness of a baby's soft, plump flesh,
perhaps also such potent neonatal equipment as a new baby's fleeting "fairy"
smiles, may be viewed as the product of countervailing selection on infants,
to compensate for Mother Nature's discriminating human mothers.
    The Infantile Equivalent of Sex Appeal
Almost nothing a baby does so delights or engages its mother as the baby's
first laugh. The baby catches her mother's eye and gives a sociable chortle.
And yet how many of us have really examined, really thought through the
sources and rationales that lie behind that unique and fairly public testimonial
to neurological development-that little laugh-and the long evolutionary
history that produced in us the powerfully pleasurable sensation on hearing
it, the rush of pride and warmth and adoration? How can creatures so help­
less take our breath away, appall us with their vulnerability, and seduce us to
their bidding? Some of their allure, no doubt, is in the eyes of the beholder.
After all, parents themselves have been selected tofind their babies luscious.
But it is not so simple.
    If mothers were instinctively nurturing, if they evolved to care for any
infant born (as essentialists argue), why should infants be selected to expend
so much metabolic energy making certain that a mother docs so? Any dull,
calorie-conserving lump of rapidly developing tissue would suffice. (Let this
grub do its lear ning at some later stage-no need to seduce at birth.)

                       AN    INI'ANT     S-EYE     VIEW
    No, something more than just selection to survive has been at work . Calo­
ries that could otherwise be channeled to somatic growth (for example,
growing quickly past the most vulnerable phases of infancy) are channeled
instead into such extravagant diversions as early cognitive capacity, imitation,
and engaging the mother with that odd arrangement of the cheek muscles we
call a "smile," an elaborate reconfiguration of the ancient primate open­
mouth invitation to play. Jo With all the various constraints on what is physi­
cally or evolutionarily possible, human infants have been selected to be
activists and salesmen, agents negotiating their own survival. I am convinced
that there must have been stringent selection among our ancestors for this
infantile equivalent of sex appeal.
    But none of these extravagant powers babies use to massage maternal sen­
sory systems matter unless infants get to first base. That means being picked
up and held near the breast. Thus, newborns must appeal on sight. But once a
baby's status as "a keeper" is assured, is there anything special about a baby's
first hours after birth? Probably only in the sense that a mother close to her
baby after birth is that much closer to recognizing that baby as her own so
that the two arc off to a promising beginning to a long relationship. In the
next chapter I evaluate some of the current advice about "bonding" right after
birth.

 Ultimately, the most liberatinB piece cf iriformation a woman could have is that
                           her irifant can attach to anyone.

W
                hen our first child was born in the late I9Jos, no doctor or
                nurse questioned our desire for my husband to be present at
                the birth or to have the baby "room in" rather than disappear
into a centralized nursery. This was a marked departure from earlier policy in
the United States and many other Western countries.
    By the end of the nineteenth century, administratively convenient central­
ized depots where nurses could monitor their newborn charges had become
a standard feature of American maternity wards. Mothers waited in their
rooms for a chance to hold their babies during scheduled visits. Friends and
family milled around a pane of glass, straining to catch a glimpse of the baby,
asking each other, "W hich one is it?" It took more than half a century for
medical professionals to question the hy gienic as well as the humanitarian
wisdom of communal nurseries.
    Newborn mammals did not evolve to cope with exposure to the pathogens
of so many different individuals. Apart from a handful of colonial breeders,
like the Mexican freetailed bats, among whom thousands and thousands of
creched babies hang from the ceilings of nursery caves, most newborn mam­
mals are sequestered among dose kin, and many-wild apes, for example­
remain exclusively in contact with moms. It is a big advantage for newborns
to have their skin and the insides of their nostrils colonized by the same bacte­
ria strains as the mother's. This benign colonization reduces the opportunity
for disease-causing forms such as Staphylococcus aureus to infect these areas
later. 1 Similarly, intestinal and other germs contracted from the mother will
be the same ones her milk provides defenses against. For a newborn, whose
own immune sy stem will not really function for another six months, there
are merits to keeping infections in the family.

    During the 19 sos, a series of nursery-related diarrhea epidemics oc­
curred in U.S. hospitals.2 These outbreaks, together with pressure from
attachment theorists, caused medical personnel to rethink the advisability of
centralized nurseries. A further impetus for allowing babies to remain in the
same rooms as their mothers arose with the publication in 1972 of a report in
the New England Journal cf Medicine purporting to demonstrate a "critical
period" in the minutes and hours just after birth when mothers imprint on
their infants. 3
    "Critical Periods"
Par for the course, an excellent reform movement, intended to make the
birth process in the United States more humane, swiftly turned evangelical.
What had been presented to me at the birth of my first baby as a welcome
option, had by the births of numbers two and three been elevated to "advis­
able." At the extreme end of this movement, some new mothers (whether
they felt like it or not) were instructed to engage in set amounts of postpar­
tum flesh-against-flesh intimacy, beginning right after birth, to ensure that
"bonding" took place.
    In this fiasco, "bonding" quickly became conflated with the much slower
attachment process Bowlby and coworkers were talking about. By the 199os,
the pendulum had swung so far that in some hospitals new mothers were
being rated: "bonded" or "not bonded." Nor was Madison Avenue far behind.
The "Right Start Catalog" advertises a "Baby-n-Momerobics Video" to guide
mothers as they "cuddle and bond" with their infants, simultaneously exercis­
ing their "bonding techniques" while getting back into shapc-"for use with
infants up to 25 lbs."
    "Bonding" is the modern version of the old ethological process of imprint­
ing. The term imprinting, from the German Praegung, derives from the idea of
a coin, which can be easily shaped for a brief molten interlude, after which
the metal becomes unstampablc. Konrad Lorenz and other early ethologists
used it as a metaphor for the instinctive attachment of just-hatched geese to
the first moving creature they sec. The possibility that such imprinting
occurred in humans had intrigued Bowlby, but only briefly. Ethologist Robert
Hinde quickly convinced him that there might be "sensitive periods" for
learning, hut that nothing so mechanistic as "imprinting" was likely to evolve
in a primate.
                           OF   HUMAN       BONDAGE
    Attachment versus Bonding
'Whereas Bowlby focused on how irifants become attached to their mothers in
the months after birth, "bonding" posited a t·apid process whereby mothers
form an emotional attachment to infants in the hours right after birth. Scien­
tific evidence for this Velcro-style attachment derived from studies of sheep
and goats, whose mothers imprint on their smells while licking off the amni­
otic fluid right after birth (see pages 1 n-61 ) . None of the research on bond­
ing came from primates, who arc far more flexible in this respect. In stark
contrast to primates, sheep are intransigently discriminating about which
babies they will accept. Unless the baby smells just like the baby whose scent
the mother imprinted on moments after she gave birth, she rejects all over­
tures. Sheep virtually never adopt orphans. Nevertheless, people continued
to extrapolate from sheep to women, proposing a ewe-style "critical period"
for humans.4
    For the most part, studies comparing human mothers who spent extra
minutes with their babies after birth with "control" mothers who did not
were inconclusive except in the case I?[ mothers who were already at risk I?[abandon­
ina their babies. For mothers at risk, contact in the hours after birth could
indeed make a difference. In the case of mothers generally, however, not hav­
ing contact with their infants immediately after birth had no measurable
effects on the security of mother-infant attachment a year later. 5 But at the
time, even research scientists aware of the fallacy of comparing herd-living,
precocious lambs with human babies and their mothers, initially held their
tongues. None wanted to interfere with welcome efforts by pediatricians to
"naturalize" the birth process. Those who did speak out confined their criti­
cisms to research journals.6 As usual in such cases, a conspiracy of well­
intentioned silence backfired-in spades.
    Time spent with her infant after birth probably does stimulate a mother's
desire to continue this rewarding activity. The process of recognizing her
baby, learning its smell, and, especially, the initiation of lactation, change a
mother's physiological state. By several days after birth there is an emerging
relationship between mother and infant. It would be difficult for a mother
who has allowed herself to grow close to a baby to change course at that
point. This is why close physical contact right after birth reduces the likeli­
hood that mothers at riskfor distancin9 themselvesfrom their baby will do so, as we
saw in the "experiment" historian Rachel Fuchs documented at Paris's Mater-
                                               '

nite (see page 3 15). But in terms of subsequent mother-infant attachment,
these first hours and days are more nearly a nice idea than a "biological
need."7 Should a mother otherwise committed to caregiving miss this ren­
dezvous with her infant, and begin to commune the next day, there arc no
measurable ill effects-provided someone else keeps the infant warm and
safe in the interim. Unlike sheep, bonding right after birth is by no means
essential for the development of love. It can, however, faci1itate the process.
      Published critiques of the notion of a "critical period" immediately after
birth were available to anyone who took the trouble to look them up. 8 But
the idea of a quick-fix that guaranteed a nurturing mother proved irresistible.
Thus an interesting (if improbable) hypothesis picked up steam, in spite of
the fact that, if critically examined, it would have been quickly disproved. For
the "bonding" movement generated its own peculiar mythologies and potent
afterbirth rituals. In the popular imagination, in the media, and in maternity
wards the promise of a simple rite that could guarantee "good" mothers spun
out of control.
     Backlash Against Bowlby
When inevitably the backlash came, it, too, arrived in excess, with a
vengeance. "Infant Bonding: A Bogus Notion," proclaimed the headline in the
Wall Street Journal. Well-meaning pediatricians, the "medical establishment,"
                         OF    HUMAN       BONDAGE
scientists generally, baby adYocates, and anyone connected to attachment the­
ory (even though its focus was on how infants attach to mothers, rather than
how mothers bond to babies) were indiscriminately lumped together and
made to sound preposterous. Balanced scholarship was sacrificed to the polit­
ical expedient of exposing an anti-mother "conspiracy" between "the medical
establishment" and the "baby gurus."9 To a certain faction of feminists, the
"bonding" mandate was just another instance of looking to the animals for
"natural laws" that happened to validate patriarchal interests.
    With books like Mother-lrifant Bonding: A Scientifi c Fiction, angry advocates
on behalf of mothers, especially mothers who now felt guilty because they
had "neYer had a chance to bond," declared open season on the whole idea of
any special biologically based relationship between a mother and her infant.
    Many feminists had even more compelling reasons than the bonding fiasco
to dismiss attachment theory, an unwelcome message that went beyond what
a mother was supposed to do right after birth. For attachment theory seemed
to prescribe what mothers should do for years to come.
One fine spring day in 1 977, John Bowlby, seventy years of age and innocent
of much of the trouble brewing, was belatedly awarded an honorary degree
by Cambridge University. At what should have been an uncomplicated cele­
bration, august Cambridge dons found themselves squinting in disbelief as
a small band of women materialized on King's Parade and marched along
the road in front of the gray stone quadrangle of King's College. To the
dons, honoring a "baby man" scarcely seemed controversial. Why were these
                      . �10
women demonstratmgr
    It was no fluke. Growing numbers of women were coming to regard
attachment theory as anathema. Rarely mentioned in feminist circles,
Bowlby's name, when it did come up, was uttered with derision. Why might
women have a stake in discrediting research ostensibly focused on infant
well-being? Having panicked often enough myself over whether I could live
up to the stiff responsibilities of motherhood, I understand why.
    Irreconcilable Dilemmas
About the time Bowlby was being honored, back in the other Cambridge, the
one in the United States, I was being interviewed for an article on the new
                                          '
490                     AN    INFANT S-EYE VIEW
field of sociobiology. One angle to the story had to do with women who com­
bine motherhood with demanding careers, a reasonable line of inquiry since
my daughter had just been born (and, thanks in part to an unseen Bowlby over
in England, immediately turned over to her father to hold). RobertTrivers­
the brilliant y oung sociobiologist whose theories about parental investment
are so fundamental to this book-was asked to comment on my work. No
doubt Trivers spoke straight from the heart when he told the reporter: "My
own view is that Sarah ought to devote more time and study and thought to
raising a healthy daughter. T hat way misery won't keep traveling down the
generations." Needless to say, these off-the-cuff remarks, which cut straight to
                                                                                 11
the heart of feminist wariness of evolutionists, were prominently published.
    Here was not just a reference to intergenerational transmission of bad
mothering, what the Bowlbian Selma Fraiberg had termed "the ghost in the
nursery."T his was a reference to the ghosts in my nursery. Was I offended?
After all, my daughter's father was an infectious-disease specialist working
long hours, and ProfessorTrivers, also a father, was just as consumed by his
work as I was by mine. Clearly, in addition to the assumption about what
infants need, there was an additional assumption being made about precisely
who should meet those needs. Progenitors of one sex only needed to realign
their priorities in order to prevent "misery" passing down generations.
    At the time, though, the unfairness of this logic was far less riveting than
my own naooin9 anxiety lest Trivers was ri9ht. Worse than sciatica, these are
nerve spasms that never subside. Long after a child is grown and has left the
nest, if she makes a single misstep, painful signals are triggered in a maternal
body far away, as if from a phantom limb.
    By endowing human infants with a long mother-centered primate heri­
tage, by envisioning infants with special needs and mothers as creatures espe­
cially designed to satisfy them, and by situating an infant's sense of security
and self in the availability of this specially equipped mother, evolutionists like
Bowlby and Trivers appeared to be imposing on women painful choices no
man need ever make: her aspirations versus her infant's well-being; vocation
or reproduction.Twenty y ears later, I still return to this topic with trepidation.
A century before de Beauvoir warned about the "enslavement" of mothers,
George Eliot had produced a timeless portrait of the conflict between a tal-
                          OF    HUMAN BONDAGE                                491
ented woman's drive to reach the pinnacle of a demanding profession and her
awareness of her baby's needs. In her novel Daniel Deronda, Eliot tells the
story of an opera singer, Princess Alcharisi, who gives her baby son away.
    Here is Eliot's portrait of a woman torn between maternity and vocation.
Late in life, the renowned singer is reunited briefly with her son, now grown.
Her talent waning, and at a postmenopausal time in life when such a woman
might well suffer regrets (the age when the childless de Beauvoir was
rumored to have said she tasted "ashes" in her mouth), she tries to explain
why, in spite of abundant resources, she chose not to rear her son.
    "You are not a woman," Princess Alcharisi tells her son, reliving the old
decision.
    You may try-but you can never imagine what it is to have a man's
    force of genius in you, and yet to suffer the slavery of being a girl. To

    Motherguilt
Not just great artists, but ordinary women who simply aspire to chart their
lives their own way, as individuals rather than as nursemaids captive to infant
needs, fear that an infant attached means the mother enchained. From this
perspective, the flip side of mother-centered attachment models is the arrival
of a baby who like a bailiff enters where a mother lives and "attaches" her life.
Like early European mothers convincing themselves that a "changeling" child
is not really human, professional mothers today can be found persuading
themselves that infant needs are as negotiable as an employment contract. A
mother, she tells herself, can make up next month for the business trip she
needs to take this month, atoning for ten-hour disappearances five days a
week and an ever-fluctuating roster of baby-sitters with "quality time" after
dinner or during the hours outside her overtime work on weekends.
    Alternatively, a mother can dismiss attachment theory altogether as
another facet of patriarchal oppression.T his explains the popularity of books
like Motherouilt: How Our Culture Blames MothersjorWhat'sWrono with Society that
urge women to ignore the "din of mother bullying which has been midwifed
by the baby gurusT. Berry Brazelton, Penelope Leach, and Benjamin Spock,
among others." Attachment critic Diane Eyer blames their "psychobabble
about attachment and bonding" for a "backlash against working mothers
                                        '
                       AN   INFANT S-EYE            VIEW
in the courts and in the workplace." This was only one of many broadsides
against the "attachment canon." Its author explains how attachment theory
was "first developed in the I 9s-os . . . [and rests] on the bedrock assumption
that only mothers can provide the caring, nurturing relationship their chil­
dren need to survive."13
    An unguarded remark to a reporter by Professor Trivers summons all the
phantoms that press in upon ambitious mothers, or mothers who must work,
unleashing a cascade of self-doubts. Just who comforted her infant when she
was otherwise occupied? Were they loving? What will be the long-term psy­
chological consequences of repeated separations? For a mother who has just
wrung herself free from the desperate grip of a toddler, frantic and unwilling
to stay at daycare while Mom gets to her shift at work, such questions are
sickening. They remind her of irreconcilable dilemmas. At that point, she is in
no condition to patiently and clearheadedly tease apart all the disparate facts,
ideas, distortions, and prejudices tangled there in a mare's nest of conflicting
demands. How much more expedient to simply reject any theory that legit­
imizes infant needs. This is why women were demonstrating against John
Bowlby in 1977 and why polemical "get mother off the hook" books are sell­
ing well.
    The quickest way out, in the short term at least, was to distort and carica­
ture what evolutionists and developmentalists were saying about infant needs
and then conflate disparate literatures-the scientific literature on how infant
primates come to attach to caretakers with a different literature on the criti­
cal need for ungulate mothers to "bond" with their infants in the first hours
after birth. Likewise, the horrendous experiences of unwanted children
warehoused in Romanian orphanages were lumped together under the head­
ing "maternal deprivation" right along with children spending some hours
each week in daycare. A little pseudoscholarly sleight of hand and, presto,
Bowlby's observation that primate infants evolved so as to form a strong
attachment to their mother was recast into a strict prescription for healthy
emotional development in human young that depends on an early and exclu­
sive association with the mother. Once rendered preposterous (since it is
obvious that infants reared on other regimens can do fine), what a relief to
deep-six the whole attachment enterprise and replace it with new supersti­
tions about innately flexible and resilient ready-formed personalities waiting
to emerge, for whom "good enough" care suffices in a world where it is con­
sidered crass to ask anyone to define what "good enough" means.
                            OF   HUMAN BONDAGE                                   493
     " 'At risk,' 'attachment,' 'bonding': It's a wonder mothers don't break out
in a rash every time they hear these psychobabble terms," writes the author
of ,l!othcrguilt. "And they hear them constantly from the professional child­
rearing advisers .... Thou shalt worry that anyone but yourself that takes
care of your children will shame you and damage them. Thou shalt sec your
husband, babysitter, neighbor, day care provider, aunt and grandmother as a
threat to your standing as a Good Mother."14The same newspapers and Sun­
day supplements that had provided a willing forum for the folklore about
mother-infant bonding now unselfconsciously championed the "new scholar­
ship." Rarely has that overused phrase "throwing out the baby with the bath
water" applied so well.
     But wait a moment. Somebody pick up the baby while we take a timeless
tip on scholarship from George Eliot: "It seems to me much better to read a
man's own writing than to read what others say about him," she wrote to a

     Mothers and Allomothers
What did Bowlby actually say? He said that primate infants, including
humans, are born immobile and vulnerable. This is true. He pointed out that
they respond very poorly to being left alone, or otherwise being made to feel
insecure, which is also true.Human infants have a nearly insatiable desire to
be held and to bask in the sense that they are loved. To this extent, the needs
of human infants are enormous, and largely non-negotiable. The question
is, what arc the implications of this for their mothers? How warranted is
the deep suspicion that if evolutionary perspectives are allowed a foot in the
door, the bailiffs representing "natural law" will march in and impose the
notion that the organism that bears this baby, and she alone, must bear
responsibility for caring for it? How inevitable is this tyranny, which tells a
mother that "this" (to quote Princess Alcharisi) "is what you are wanted for"?
     Part of the problem of course is that there is little agreement about whose
interests are to be maximized in a world where conflicting self-interests­
between parents and offspring, between mothers and fathers, within fami­
lies, between families-are endemic. What goal are we trying to achieve?
Secure adults? Good citizens? Independent ones? Self-starters focused on fast
tracks? Satisfied mothers? Reproductively successful family lines (in the
recent past usually patrilines)? Maximized human potential? And if so,
whose? Typically, those with the least power, and of course no vote, arc

infants. Understandably, perhaps, those most threatened by acknowledging
infant needs-mothers with aspirations to do things other than mother­
were the ones who felt most compelled to downplay infant needs.
"DENIAL IS NOT A RIVER IN EGYPT" reads the message on a musty placard in an
archaeology museum where I once worked. Denial of infant needs runs like
an invisible and insidious countercurrent through publications purporting to
correct the "river of mother-blame" coursing through our society. Yet one of
the many ironies in the bonding saga is that even if someone were so rash as to
succumb to the naturalistic fallacy and imagine that what evolved is necessar­
ily what should be, there is remarkably little in the primate evolutionary
record that turns a female's sex into a precharted destiny of full-time stay-at­
home caretaking. Nor is there anything that rules out a mother sharing or del­
egating caretaking to others. Female primates have always been dual-career
mothers, forced to compromise between maternal and infant needs. It is pre­
cisely for this reason that primate mothers , including human foragers, have
always shared care of offspring with others-when it wasfeasible. Acknowledg­
ing infant needs docs not necessarily enslave mothers.
    Sad to say, however, that acknowledgment docs not solve the basic prob­
lem of surrounding developing infants with people who feel committed to
them. Demonstrating that in the evolutionary past the answer to the question
"Who cared?" was more often a matter of circumstances does not instantly
make adequate alternatives available. The politician who proclaims that"every
child from the moment of conception [should be] protected by law and by
love" is merely mouthing words. 16 Parental emotions cannot be legislated.
    An updated evolutionary perspective cannot solve such problems, but it
can at least focus attention on the real issues. It is not a matter of "mother­
hood versus vocation." Rather, the question is: Under what circumstances can
a mother safely afford to delegate care to allomothers? And, additionally:
How can allomothcrs he motivated to care? Obstacles mothers face when
they seck to go off to forage or to work arc real enough , particularly in envi­
ronments (workplaces) where infants arc not welcome and mothers lose
credibility for considering their needs. These problems have less to do with
an infant's need for exclusive care hy its mother than with values and attitudes
in modern workplaces, and the scarcity of reliable and willing alloparcnts.
                           OF    HUMAN       BONDAGE                             49.5"
   hen Bowlby, from his very first published paper in 1 944, had specified
"mother" or "mother figure." Critics like Margaret Mead had seized on
Bowlby's concern with maternal deprivation to claim that he meant that
mothering "cannot be safely distributed among several figures." And Bowlby
continued to he associated with this essentialist posture (only the mother
would do) e\·en after he specifically objected that "No such views have been
                   ,7
expressed ll)' me. 1
   So many people were so passionately divided over the question "Who
cares?" that the point of the enterprise-defining infant needs-was lost.
Bowlby's personal opinions on the subject of new mothers working did not
help matters. On this score, Bowlby was all too outspoken:
   This whole business of mothers going to work, it's so bitterly contro­
   versial, hut I do not think it's a good idea. I mean women go out to
   work and make some fiddly little bit of gadgetry which has no particu­
   lar social value, and children are looked after in indifferent day nurs­
   eries. It's very d!lficult to set people to look qfter other people's children.
   [Italics added.] Looking after your own children is hard work. But you
   get some rewards in that. Looking after other people's children is very
   hard work, and you don't get many rewards for it. I think that the role
   of parents has been grossly undervalued .. .. All the emphasis has
   been put on so-called economic prosperity.18
What is important to keep in mind, however, is that even if Bowlby's personal
shortsightedness caused him to be selective about the evidence he cited, it
did not invalidate the central premise of his model: infants seek secure attach­
ments and need a secure base for healthy emotional development. Bowlby
focused on a !Kung-like ideal of an all-indulgent mother who provides exclu­
sh·e care for her infant for the first four years of life.Alternatively, he might
have chosen a less indulgent Hadza mother, who weans after two years, or
even looked at infant-sharing primates instead of totally possessive chimps.
Today we have much more extensive data on people like the Aka and the Efc,
where infants from birth are passed among multiple caregivers with whom
they become very familiar and are quite at ease.Far from growing up less
secure, such infants arc if anything more so.
   T he central reason Bowlby gave for opposing the notion of new mothers
working outside the home was his purely practical observation that it is "very
                                             '
                         AN INFANT S-EYE               VIEW
difficult to get people to look after other people's children."This, alas, is true.
It is the crux of the matter.
Bowlby's personal views about working mothers do not undermine the valid­
ity of his theory about how and why infants become attached to their caretak­
ers any more than Charles Darwin's blindness to the sexual assertiveness of
females in some species invalidates the theory of sexual selection. Aspects of
the model may need to be revised, but the underlying logic holds true so long
as the assumptions and observations essential to the model hold.
    No doubt patriarchal bias played a role in Victorian (and earlier) ideas
about motherhood. And, yes, such biases permeate the writings of evolution­
ists, from the nineteenth century onward. It was an all-male dub and, unwit­
tingly, Darwinians accepted the biased assumptions handed them on a platter
by their predecessors who were more nearly moralists than scientists.
    Bowlby was not immune. The same biases were still very much in evi­
dence in 197t; when Wilson published his pioneering work on Sociobiology,
which included a notoriously inaccurate description of foraging societies that
claimed that "During the day the women and children remain in the residen­
tial area while the men forage for game or its symbolic equivalent in the form
of barter and money."19 A Victorian (and a 19 s os suburban) ideal of mother
tending the hearth was substituted for the actual life of a highly mobile Pleis­
tocene gatherer.
    But Wilson, let's recall, was an entomologist and had to give himself a
crash course in ethnography in order to write the chapter on humans for
Sociobiology. Perhaps more telling, professional anthropologists themselves
failed to register this whopper     -  e ve n anthropologists who had actually helped
collect the data indicating that a woman in a hunte r gatherer society might
                                                            -
travel a full 1, t;oo m ile s in a year while carrying a year-old baby. The error
was simply overlooked because it corresponded with expectations about how
the world should appear.
                             20
    Mothers at home, caring for kids-here was an ideal so powerful that it
led researchers to overlook the significance of their own important findi ngs       .
Does this mean that scientists arc inevitably too mired in their personal biases
to ever be objective? No, absolutely not. Locating and correcting biases is a
normal feature of the often slow and inellicient progress of scientific unde1·-
                           OF   HUMAN BONDAGE                               4-91
standing. Science, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, is the worst way to get at
the truth, except for the alternatives.
    There is no doubt about it: biases informed early definitions of female
nature. \Vhcrc research touched on who cat·es for babies, the biases took even
longer to correct than is usually the case. No doubt, too, the lag had more to
do with men's eYolutionary histories than with women's. It derived from all
the things that it is rarely in male interests to perceive.
    For millions of years male reproductive success has depended upon view­
ing females as individuals to be coerced, defended, and constrained. Chang­
ing such ancient attitudes docs not come easily to men, nor is it a subject that
I as a woman can feel dispassionate about. I still remember the first time I
heard a male anthropologist giving a seminar about "exchanging women
between groups." His casual depiction of women as chattel enraged me. I
scribbled fiercely in my notes: "This is what it must feel like to be black and
go to a lecture on the Klu Klux Klan." As a woman, I had an evolutionary past
and a history of my own.
    Long socialized for subordinate roles, women may be more inclined to
look at the world from more than one perspective, male as well as female,
dominant as well as subordinate. For those accustomed to the perquisites of
patriarchy, however, it would less often be useful to sec the world from the
point ohicw of those female subordinates whose reproductive potential they
sought to coopt for their own ends. And few men-without guidance and
extra efl'ort-seem eager to do so. Once alerted to the problems, however,
and with the opening of professions like "naturalist" and "evolutionist"
to encompass a wider range of genders, old biases began to be corrected
(although I need to be careful here not to overstate progress on this score).
    The existence of past biases in science, then, is no grounds for abandon­
ing the enterprise altogether; but it certainly is grounds for introducing
better safeguards against the all-too-human propensity for self-serving self­
deceptions. So, back to mothers. Docs attachment theory "attach" the lives of
mothers? Not necessarily, but for mothers who care about their infants' well­
being it often comes to the same thing.
    Childcare Problems
The chief problem facing mothers is the one Bowlby identified years ago: a
scarcity of motivated alloparents. How do mothers who go ofT foraging keep
their immobile and vulnerable infants safe and secure? In many species,
                                        '
                         AN   INFANT      s-EYE      VIEW
fathers are the co-caretakers of choice, as well as caretakers by default-at
 least of older infants. A survey of the primatological and ethnographic evi­
dence also provides a spectrum of tolerable solutions, not all of them equally
palatable to infants. Among anthropoid primates, species-typical sex roles are
not quite as fixed as many assume. Solutions vary with species, as we saw with
titi monkeys. They also vary with circumstances, as we saw with the "Silas
Marner response" among gorillas and langurs, and as we sec every day in the
lives of the men around us.
    Unarguably, the majority of hunter-gatherer societies are characterized by
close mother-infant proximity for at least the first several years. Care of
infants by fathers is unusual, and care by male alloparents rarer still. But the
recipe is not carved in stone. When ecological circumstances permit (or
require), mothers readily avail themselves of help from a father, grand­
mother, niece, nephew, or sibling. Female primates have always entrusted
infants to willing allomothers whenever a mother could be corifident cf s'!fely
retrievinB them. Some of these relationships were reciprocal, but for the most
part, allomothers have been fathers or kin, or, with the emergence of strati­
fied societies, desperate subordinates with little choice.
    Infant-sharing in other primates and in various tribal societies has never
been accorded center stage in the anthropological literature. Many people
don't even realize it goes on. Yet where studied, the consequences of co­
operative care-in terms of survival and biological fitness of mother and
infant-turn out to be all to the good, or at least on balance preferable to
alternatives. 21 In infant-sharing primate species, infants grow faster, and (as in
the case of parents using wet nurses) mothers produce more surviving infants
in a lifetime. Shared vigilance helps reduce infant mortality. Mothers not bur­
dened by infants forage more efficiently, and their infants cultivate wide
social networks, and possibly suffer less from sibling rivalry for maternal
attention. For an alternative notion of what it means to be born human, con­
sider the Agta foragers of the Philippines, a very unusual hunter-gatherer
society because women participate along with men and dogs in hunting wild
pig and deer. Fifty-seven percent of their meat comes from hunts in which
women participate . When an Agta is horn,

Late in the first y ear of life, an Agta mother may leave her infant in camp with
an older sister, grandmother, or the father. If necessary, she carries her infant
along with her, cYcn though there is no doubt that her burden constrains her
freedom of moYement and diminishes her efficiency. Mothers may carry
inf:·mts as young as six months out hunting over treacherous and thorny ter­
rain. The prospect of injury is high for all concerned, and 30 to 50 percent of
                                       21
Agta children die before puberty.
    En'n when mothers gather rather than hunt, allomothers can provide an
important service, and eYen a few unusual perks. Not only do infants among
the Efc pygmies of Central Africa grow up in famously gentle company, but
these newborns get to taste breast milk sooner than babies any place else
in the world. Why? Although breast milk does not normally come in until a
few days after birth, allomothers are quite casual about suckling another
mother's baby, including a newborn being passed from woman to woman.
    In the only systematic survey of multiple caregiving in traditional soci­
eties, anthropologist Barry Hewlett identified three circumstances that facili­
tate it: flexibility in schedules and considerable leisure time, which may be
more characteristic of foraging peoples than herders, farmers, or wage­
earners; living in close quarters, so that many people will be familiar with the
infant (and Yice Yersa); and, perhaps most importantly, high adult-to-child
ratios, meaning that there will be more eager caregivers than there are
infants.
    Still there is a gap between, on the one hand, these isolated cases where
males are actin' participants in infant care, and, on the other hand, the rest of
the world.Since the women's movement revolutionized the way that we talk
about male caretakers and paternal roles, there has been a marked change.It
would not be honest, however, to pretend that this represents a revolution.
For example, fathers in the United States spend much more time today
directly caring for children than they did at the beginning of the twentieth
century, but the change is still measurable in minutes per week, not hours.
Even in the most progressive countries in this respect, such as Sweden, where
either parent has the option to take paternity leave, few fathers take advan­
tage of the policy.24

     In the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness Bowlby had in mind, the
birth mother has the greatest chance of being on the spot, lactating and moti­
vated to hold and carry this baby. As discussed in chapter 9, the mother is
likely to be more sensitive than the father to signals of infant need. This
may be due to innate temperament, or to "the company she has kept," for a
mother would have spent more time ncar other women and small infants and
be more practiced in caretaking. 26 Once a relationship between mother and
baby is forged, the mother becomes the person emotionally most primed
to extend her tour of duty for the requisite number of years to ensure sur­
vival.
     Rather than some magical "essence of mother," what makes a mother
maternal is that she is (invariably ) at the scene, hormonally primed, sensitive
to infant signals, and related to the bahy. These factors lower her threshold for
giving of herself to satisfy the infant's needs. Once her milk comes in, the
mother's urge to nurture grows stronger still. Furthermore, compared to the
father (who also shares at least half of his genes with this infant by common
descent), there is a good chance that this infant represents a higher propor-
                           OJ:' lllll\IAN   BONDAGE                           5"01
tion of her reproducth·e prospects than of his (though not necessarily, if she
has se,·eral, and this is the only child he ever sires). These factors make the
mothc1· the likeliest candidate to become the primary caretaker. But they do
not constitute an unyicldino prescription.
    Mammalian babies eagerly suck milk wherever they learn to obtain it. Of
itself, this obscnation speaks volumes about the inherent slack in the infant's
moth·ational system for seeking nurture; human babies can recognize but
arc not spccitically imprinted on their mothers' breasts, and seck nurture
whcrc,·cr they arc comforted and rewarded. Note, for example, how easily
infants figure out that rubber nipples deliver milk faster than breasts do, and
although it's harder on their digestion, still learn to prefer bottles over
breast.
    Once formed, of course, there is no more powerful emotional glue than
an infant's attachment to a favorite caretaker, and yet even this bond, if bro­
ken, can be reforged with someone else (though there are limits, which vary
from individual to individual, to the elasticity of learned trust). But what pre­
disposes an infant to attach to one person rather than another? And why is it
that, hands down, the mother so often emerges as the frontrunner for infant
affections? It's not just a matter of her milk.
    It is not preordained that the infant's primary attachment will be to the
mother. There are other options. But when you consider that the mother usu­
ally has a lower threshold for responding to infant needs, and is the first to
respond to a cry of discomfort, with her face, her voice, her breasts, the satis­
fying sweet milk they spurt in the baby's mouth-these attributes make the
mother the likeliest prospect for her infant to form a primary attachment to.
But second-best has proved adequate often enough. In fact, when the aBo­
mother is more committed than the mother, second-best may be superior.
    Maternal propensities interact with infant needs in ways that make certain
preferences highly probable; the infant takes it from there. The mother's sex
may not be her destiny. But from the perspective of a newborn, staring
blurrv-eved at the world, there are attributes to a mother that make her an
       "  "
easily acquired taste. For reasons that have less to do with innate properties of
mothers than they do with how effective infants are in achieving their first
choice, babies in the majority of primates arc found in the exclusive posses­
sion of their mothers, and vice versa. Once initiated, infants develop a pas­
sionate preference for this arrangement.

}02                    AN    INFANT S-EYE VIEW
    Why Don't Mothers Use Allomothers More?
Statistically an observer is far more likely to see a mother carrying her infant
and caring for him than witness the fleeting moment when an infant is aban­
doned . Everywhere in primatedom, mothers are typically seen carrying
babies about, with infant and mother mutually "attached" to each other. As a
result, mothers were assumed to be innately and uniquely qualified for
"mothering." It was an easy conclusion to reach. In the context of this sort of
tautological thinking, no one asked: Why are mothers carrying their babies?
    The question was finally addressed when anthropologists became ac­
quainted with peoples like the Efe and individuals other than the mother were
observed mothering. Only then did researchers give more thought to multiple
caretaking. So long as it had been mothers carrying babies, as expected, alter­
native styles of caretaking weren't considered.
    Given the manifest survival and reproductive advantages of relying on
allomothers, why weren't mothers giving their babies to someone else to
hold while they foraged (or turning infants over to their subadult daughters
for as long as those daughters remained in the vicinity)? If in nonhuman pri­
mates, infants born to mothers who hand their babies over to allomothers
grow faster, and the mothers reproduce at shorter intervals without having
to make tradeoffs in survival chances; if, as seems clear, maternal fitness can
be enhanced by using allomothers, why haven't mothers been selected to use
allomothers more?
    Consider the case of !Kung mothers. Why don't these mothers leave their
babies with prercproductives, the children who are hanging out in a !Kung
encampment when their mothers go off to forage? According to Patricia
Draper and the other ethnographers of the !Kung, older children arc doing
things like cracking open mongongo nuts already brought back to camp . Why
does this supply of baby-sitters go untappcd?27
    Think back to the discussions in chapters 4 ("Unimaginable Variation")
and I I ("Who Cared?") for reminders about why nonhuman and human pri­
mates might not use allomothers more. A chimpanzee mother who turns her
baby over to its older sister risks having her infant eaten by a predator or
killed by an infanticidal conspecific. When a mother chimp rebuffs a daughter
eager to hold her little sister, it is not so much this would-be caretaker she is
worried about as the daughter's ability to keep her infant safe from these
others. Since chimpanzee mothers almost never give up infants to eager older
siblings, observers never have a chance to find out what would happen if they
                           OF    HUMAN RONDAGE                                )03
did. Unsuspecting mothers in another species have, however, unintentionally
proYided natural experiments. These arc the rare and unfortunate instances
in which African women left babies unattended only to find that a passing
wild chimpanzee seized and ate them. Depending on the circumstances, a
chimp may adopt an unattended baby-or kill it. A competent caretaker is
            28
essential.
     In the case of human foragers, mothers have trouble finding someone both
willing and qualified to fill this role. Where there arc no infertile women or
women past childbearing age, there will typically be a dearth of adult volun­
teers; and unless camp is a very safe place, using immature "childminders" is
r isky. A range of considerations may make allomothcrs unsafe or unpractical,
depending on conditions. Among the desert-dwelling !Kung, for example,
keeping the baby hydrated is a big constraint, since infants have no other safe
drinking source than mother. Unable to safely leave infants at camp, mothers
carry them long distances.
     My guess is that alternative childcare systems-like the Hadza's, or even
the Efe's-have been more prevalent than commonly supposed. Even before
the Neolithic, allomothers were employed when scife allomaternal options were
ami/able. It is beginning to look like the prevalence of exclusive and long­
lasting mother-infant relationships might be an artifact of the harsh environ­
ments where hunter-gatherer lifestyles have persisted long enough for
anthropologists to study them, an artifact of mothers needing to travel long
distances to find food and water, of predators lurking nearby, and of settle­
ment patterns where the mother's kin live far away.
     What is certain is that as soon as an infant begins to be weaned and a wider
pool of baby-sitters becomes eligible, they are enlisted. Among the Hadza,
where food sources are available near camp, children as young as three are
left in multi-age groups to roam about and combine play with food gathering.
It would not be unusual for a ten-year-old Hadza child to combine baby­
sitting with a quick pick-me-up in the form of 2oo calories' worth of
makalita berries casually picked. Such snacks are shared with younger chil­
dren, who gather round begging from their baby-sitters. 29
     "Psychological Thalidomide"?
 Identifying irifant needs is separate from deciding who should providefor them.
Monkey and ape mothers tend to be possessive of their infants. The excep­
tions include those species where benign caretakers (usually kin) arc available
                                            '
                          AN    INFANT        S-EYE     VIEW
so that mothers can be confident of retrieving hale and hearty babies. When
these conditions are met, primate mothers readily delegate infants to alia­
mothers. Sufficiently desperate, even model monkey mothers drop their
standards and consign their infants to caretakers who are less than ideal.
(Recall the ousted males with whom langur mothers deposit babies when
infanticidal males threaten them "at home.") Critics of daycare who condemn
it as "psychological thalidomide"30 need to ask themselves: Compared with
what? For those who find it unnatural, to ask: Compared with when?
    The real constraint on working mothers has little to do with imagined
ideals of Pleistocene motherhood, far more to do with locating and enlisting
reliable, motivated, long-term allomothers. Human infants need mothers
and allomothers to keep them warm, safe, mobile, stimulated, clean, fed,
hygienically hydrated, and, most important, to communicate tenderly and
responsively their commitment to go on caring. Hour by hour, supplying this
kind of care is tedious. In addition to deep-seated predispositions so well
summarized by Hamilton's r ule, caregiving is also more or less onerous,
depending on personal tastes, training, expectations, and working condi­
tions. A vast divide separates the ideal of childcare from its realities.
    Shortage of Alloparents
Many mothers find the smell of their breast-fed infants' excrement entirely
congenial. (In other mammals, like dogs, special molecules in the excrement
motivate mothers to cat it, thus keeping their burrow clean.) Few other indi­
viduals of either sex, however, can honestly say that they share this taste, or
that they enjoy changing dirty diapers. For truth in advertising, consider this
job description for a modern allomother:
    WANTED: Someone to turn his I her life over to the whims and needs if a smaller,
    weaker, iften unreasonable individualfor a period ifmonths or )'Cars. Low pay.
    Little presti9e. No security or lono-term mutual oblioations;faint prospect that
    any relationshipformed will be maintained over time. Caution: if the irifant
    comes to love you best, the mother may orow jealous and terminate the relation­
    ship early.
Not surprisingly, there arc far more mothers seeking nannies and daycarc
spots, more activists calling for universal subsidized daycarc, and politicians
promising it, than there arc reliable allomothcrs signing on to provide it.

mental constraints prevent mothers in foraging societies from relying on young haby-sitters even
more than they do. (Aiarjori.Shosta.lAnthro-Photo)
Those who seek one-on-one infant care, but are not lucky enough to have kin
to provide it, would do well to make it emotionally and materially worth­
,.,.·hile to their potential caregiver, that is, to beef up the "benefits" component
in Hamilton's equation.
      Wherever affirmative action and/ or equal rights in the workplace have
created new job opportunities for women, a shortage of female caregivers
follows in its wake. Nevertheless, the same optimism that convinced John
Boswell and other historians that infants abandoned in antiquity were gath­
ered up and reared by "kind strangers" leads contemporary policy-makers to
imagine that if we can just throw some money at the problem, we can create
adequate childcare. Somehow caretakers both willing and qualified will
emerge.
      In a recent radio broadcast, a politician voiced the opinion that we needed
to hire a fe''' more case workers to "shake the bushes" to find homes for foster
children. Once we did, suitable caregivers and suitable homes for all un­
wanted children would just come tumbling out. Among the infants he partic­
ularly had in mind were "boarder babies" born to heroin-addicted mothers
                                        '
                        AN INFANT         S-EYE     VIEW
-babies who are among the most challenging in the world to care for. With
just a bit more effort, he asserted, all of New Jersey's "boarder" babies could
easily be placed in foster homes. He reminded me of Catherine the Great and
the other great "progressives" who were convinced they could solve the prob­
lem of unwanted babies by building handsome edifices.
Scarcity of local alloparents often forces working parents to look beyond
their own neighborhoods. But grouping infants together-like bats in a com­
munal nursery-for a certain number of hours every day under the supervi­
sion of paid alloparents who are not kin, but who are expected to act as if they
are, is an evolutionary novelty, completely experimental. Already there are
greater numbers of children in daycare than ever before in human history.
The burgeoning demand for oood daycare far outstrips availability, just as its
cost outstrips most budgets.
    Given the rapid spread and highly experimental nature of paid communal
daycare for very young infants (under two years), it is unfortunate that the
many complex factors involved (different temperaments of the infants, their
variable experiences at home, the different personalities of the providers, and
so on) make it impossible to give definitive answers to parents' most pressing
questions. Evidently most children in daycare survive and develop normally.
But will they grow up as secure as those reared in continuous contact with
mothers? Are there children whose temperaments are ill suited to daycare?
Or parents whose caretaking styles are incompatible with using daycare?Will
children placed in daycare from an early age grow up to be less able to form
strong relationships, or be less caring toward others? And will they be more,
or less, qualified for life? (Keep in mind that it could turn out that those less
securely attached and those less capable of forming close relationships are the
"more qualified" for life in the modern world.)
   So far as the best small-scale daycarc centers are concerned, recent studies
arc mostly reassuring. Even for infants younger than age two, there are no
detectable bad consequences, provided babies were in high-quality care, had
a good relationship with their parents at home, and the daycarc hours were
limited-rather daunting specifications. 31 Results for very young infants who
spend more than thirty hours a week in the more institutionalized settings,
where a few caretakers struggle to meet the needs of many infants, or for
                          OF    HUMAN BONDAGE                                �07
children who bounce from one facility to another, are less encouraging. They
make open-minded mothers with options queasy and those without options
miserable. Others will simply continue to deny and contest the results as
some antifeminist conspiracy.
    Not only can effects be seen in the way infants respond to their mothers,
but also in the way mothers respond to their babies, who arc already harder
to soothe. Mothers who used daycare more than thirty hours a week tended
to be less scnsith·e with their six-month-olds, more negative with fifteen­
month-olds, than mothers who used daycare ten hours a week-an effect
that one suspects will only become magnified through time as the child finds
its mother less comforting to be around and therefore complains more.
    Few topics are more passionately debated by developmental psycholo­
gists. Yet beneath the furor lie areas of near consensus, which-at my peril­
I summarize here.
    Experts differ over just how flexible, how adaptable, human infants might
be, yet no one is saying that human adaptability provides a carte blanche
for indiscriminate care. A strong advocate of daycarc, psychologist Sandra
Scarr, professor emeritus at the University ofVirginia, recommends moni­
toring each child's response and calibrating hours in daycare to tempera­
ment; how a child copes with daycare should be a matter of continuing
concern and vigilance. Even the iconoclastic grandmother Judith Rich Har­
ris, the author of The Nurture Assumption, touted by her publishers as a book
showing how "parents matter less than you think," notes that
    In order to complete its development the [newborn baby's] brain
    requires cer tain inputs from the environment ... . The developing
    brain "expects" the baby to be taken care of by one person, or a small
    number of people, who provide food and comfort and who are around
    a lot. If this development is not met, the department of the brain that
    specializes in constructing working models of relationships might not
    dc\'elop properly. . . . 32
    Fundamentally, neither of these two views differs very much from those
of their supposed opponents, such as Jay Belsky, the developmental psycholo­
gist who became identified as a critic of daycare, a researcher self-described
as one who "violated the Xlth commandment of developmental psychology:
thou shalt not speak ill of daycarc." Belsky, who feels his reputation was dam-

     Virtually every researcher in this field concedes that when parents are
particularly inattentive, even "indifferent daycare" is preferable to home
neglect. Tucked away within the polemic, even a rabid debunker of attach­
ment theory and an outspoken feminist advocate of daycare like Diane Eyer
will allow that "alllbabiesJ certainly need the consistent loving care of a few
people"14-which is whatl took Mary Ainsworth, Mary Main , and the other
attachment theorists Eyer criticizes to have been saying all along. Caretakers

    The Importance of Behaving Like Committed Kin
The numbers arc staggering. The majority of mothers in postindustrial coun­
tries usc some form of daycarc. Many arc working mothers with babies under
two. Giwn Bowlby's personal opposition to new mothers working, it is
ironic that attachment theory today provides the most useful theoretical
model we haYe to make daycare better, to adjust allomaternal care to the
needs of hahy primates.
    When I was looking for infant daycarc in Cambridge, Massachusetts, hack
in the seventies, the best place I found was the Harvard Yard Day care center,
whose program was designed by Berry Brazelton and other pediatricians
heavily influenced by Bowlby. These pediatricians, identified by the critics of
attachment theory as special enemies of working mothers, were among those
who made it possible for me to continue to work part-time even while my
children were infants. I could confidently leave a six-month-old baby in the
care of two allomothers for part of each day. The center was set up in the
basement of what had once been Harvard's ROTC* building-a case of
swords beaten into plowshares-ncar the campus and a block from my
home. The nursery was three shabby rooms occupied by two extraordinarily
patient, allomaternally gifted women who brought supreme calm wherever
they went. A condition of leaving a baby there was volunteering to work in
the nursery, so that in addition to the very permanent staff (each of them
stayed for years) there was a fluctuating contingent of family members in a
tiny village-like setting, with a high ratio of adults to infants.
    If multiple caretakers are im·olved early in life, it frequently happens that
the infant selects one with whom to form a primary relationship. Yet children
arc rather flexible in this respect. All early caregivers become the emotional
equivalents of kin. Any caretaker is capable of communicating the message
infants desperately seek-"You arc wanted and will not be set aside"-the
message that elicits an infant's sense of security, a double-edged sword when
an allomother suddenly disappears.
    Looked at this way, Bowlby's insights invite fathers to engage more with
their newborn babies and stick with it. They lend urgency to reform move­
ments to place children in adopti\'c homes as early as possible. They do not
discourage mothers from using daycarc, but they do provide tremendous
impetus to make daycarc resemble families with a stable cast of characters

and an atmosphere that provides infants with a sense of belonging. From a
mother's point of view, there is a big difference between what evolution
designed as the likeliest outcome (infant attaches to mother) and what under
other circumstances serves perfectly well.
    From a newborn's point of view, however, little has changed. Mothers are
rarely as close or consistently available as the infant desires . Babies have no
way of knowing that the mother who went out of town on business is not
dead, that sabertooth tigers arc extinct, jaguars scarce, abandonment illegal,
or how few modern mothers would, in fact, contemplate it. For babies are
designed to proceed as if no baby bottle had been invented, no laws had ever
been passed. I turn now to the question of just why this sense of belonging
matters so much.

for what some evolutionary-minded specialists on infant development sus­
pect might be going on in our own species. Depending on the input infants
receive from the world around them, genetically very similar individuals
embark on quite different developmental pathways, growing at a different
rate, developing a different sense of self to confront the world, assigning dif­
ferent priorities to the well-being of others, even reproducing in a different
way. Individuals as closely related as full siblings may be slated for different
microenvironments, not only in infancy, but potentially through life. The
question is, why? Recently people have begun to suspect that mothers and
early experience have something to do with it. This has even led many people
to "blame" mothers if a child turns out badly. This way of thinking is very new.
    Blaming .1\-\others for Sociopaths
In previous times and places, mothers were blamed if they failed to produce
offspring, or produced offspring of the wrong sex, but they weren't blamed if
their children grew up to be criminals. Among the ancient Greeks, victims
of heinous crimes railed at a particular god, or the Fates. In India, people
blamed bad luck, karma, or turned to the malefactor's clan for restitution.
Orientals lamented lapses in the education of an unfilial child . In Africa,
witchcraft was suspected. Another favorite candidate is "breeding," or genes
that produce a certain kind of person. Think of Oliver Twist. If mothering
mattered more than breeding, how could Dickens's orphaned hero, adopted
by a clan of thieves, have turned out so well?

    The idea of blaming the behavior of a grown-up sociopath on insecure
attachment to his mother has only entered our culture since Freud, and espe­
cially since Bowlby.In a short space of time, it has become widely accepted
that a serial killer's early relationship with his mother can account for subse­
quent sociopathic tendencies.("One false move and our precious bundle of
joy will turn into an ax murderer" is how psychotherapist Shari Thurer paro­
dies this stereotype.)1
    Hence, when Newsweek ran its obligatory story on the "Blood Brothers"­
Theodore Kaczynski, the suspected "Unabomber," and his brother, David,
who turned him in-the magazine also included the obligatory portrait of a
third person, their mother, Wanda Kaczynski. Yet the most damning attribute
the magazine could unearth was that Mrs. Kaczynski "encouraged her sons in
school."
    Newsweek was sheepish enough to include the caveat that "Blaming one's
mother is the oldest [though of course it really isn't] and least original excuse
in history. . . .It may not be fair to hold Wanda Kaczynski, who is described
by her neighbors as a sweet old lady, accountable for turning her son into a
possible serial killer.  . .."2 Still, Newsweek's editors couldn't resist including
an aunt's offhand observation that perhaps Ted had initially embarked on the
path that grew lonelier and lonelier by way of a defensive response when the
birth of his younger brother displaced him from the center of attention.
    Bowlby as a young researcher had been among the first to suggest that the
sort of young delinquents "who seemed to have no feelings for anyone and
were very difficult to treat were likely to have had grossly disturbed relation­
ships with their mothers during their early years. Persistent stealing, vio­
lence, egotism , and sexual misdemeanors were among their less pleasant
characteristics." He noticed that the rare human outcomes who become
"sociopaths" were disproportionately drawn from the portion of the popula­
tion that had been "avoidantly attached" to their mothers. Bowlby assumed
that their behavior was due to a disturbance in their internalized working
model of the world that made it hard for them to learn to trust others. 3
Like many mothers, I was immediately indignant at Newsweek's presumption
in putting the spotlight on Mrs. Kaczynski. Six weeks later, however, I felt

chastened when the Washin<qton Post broke an amazing and deeply moving
story about the hospitalization ofTcd Kaczynski at the age of nine months:
    The image still haunts Wanda Kaczynski. She can still se c the photo­
    graph of her baby son, pinned down on his hospital bed. It offered what
    she now sees as a clue into how her oldest son grew into the troubled
    man he would become.... (The infant was strapped down,] terrified,
    spread-eagled so doctors could examine what they believed was a
    severe allergic reaction. His naked body was blotched with hives.His
    eyes, usually normal, were crossed in fear.4
    During that week in the hospital, the infant who would grow up to be a
strange, vengeful man who shunned human contact, and lashed out at the
world in murderous ways had no reason to assume otherwise than that an
infant's worse-case scenario had befallen him: he was abandoned. Such
accounts reinforce one's conviction that Bowlby was on to something. There
were legitimate reasons for journalists to ask whether the perception of aban­
donment might not have disrupted neural connections in the peculiarly frag­
ile psyche of Ted Kaczynski, diverting him to some alternate, antisocial
course of development.No one could blame Mrs. Kaczynski if her son was
born with an inborn propensity for schizophrenia.Yet schizophrenia, a dis­
case with a known genetic component, depends on context for its expres­
sion. W hether or not and how the disease is expressed is rarely separable
from context. But e\'en if diversion to alternate tracks---ranging from mild
to extremely delusional-occur, why might this happen? Must we presume
pathology? Surely humans, the most flexible of all primates, should be able to
O\'ercome early deficits, as many children obviously do. Even if a dispropor­
tionate number of people who grow up to be sociopaths were avoidantly
attached, one has to wonder why their "internalized working model" didn't
do a better job of correcting itself when things improved.
    The Nurture Assumption
Bowlby was the first modern psychologist to examine infant development in
an evolutionary context. Nevertheless, his training was in psychoanalysis, not
biology. He did not keep up with new developments as ethology merged with
ecology, population genetics, and life history theory to become the more
                                        1
                        AN    INFANT S-EYE          VIEW
inclusive study of the biological bases of behavior known as sociobiology.
 Bowlby was apparently not aware that there is no one species-typical, one­
size-fits-all pattern of development .
    Individuals differ in innate temperament, whether they are, for example,
shy or extroverted. 5They differ in appearance, endurance, in what foods they
can digest, in susceptibility to diseases, both physical and mental, and myriad
other attributes known to be influenced by genes. Individuals also experience
different parental effects, including many areas where a mother's or father's
social status, locale, or kin networks affect an offspring's prospects.
    In all primates, juveniles enter their social world with a great deal of
innate and acquired baggage that shapes their prospects, including their social
status relative to others in their same world. A baboon daughter, for example,
inherits her mother's rank in the female hierarchy, and if she is the youngest
daughter, is assisted by her mother to rise in rank above her older sister.
Compared to the daughter of a lower-ranking female, she will reach menar­
che and breed at an earlier age-a reproductively important milestone. Sim­
ilarly, a young male orangutan who enters a habitat already patrolled by a full
adult, dominant male, assesses that situation and indefinitely suspends further
maturation, remaining for years as a "subadult," opting to be a "Peter Pan"
morph who does not grow up until such time as it is safe and advantageous
for him to do so. These individuals, entering the social world with certain
advantages and disadvantages, somehow assess their prospects, match their
phenotypes to their available options, and develop accordingly. When that
social world changes, so docs the developing organism. Why should humans
be any less opportunistic or less flexible? Indeed, there is every indication
that they arc more so.
    In The Nurture Assumption Judith Rich Harris correctly points out that
genetically inherited traits have been given short shrift by social psychologists
in their explanations of how children develop. At the same time, however,
Harris underestimates-although she never entirely discounts-the extent
of parentally mediated efl'ccts. ("Parents matter less than you think and peers
matter more," the hook promises.) What she leaves out is the extent to which
input from parents, especially from mothers, influences the dcYcloping indi­
vidual as he or she hegins to negotiate his or her place in the world. Demo­
graphic profiles     hottom-hcavy    with young, and social       institutions of
deYeloping nations in the late twentieth century with their schools and gangs,

mean that this world is largely inhabited by peers, but this has not always
been so.
    It is the individual child or teenager who is the active agent in this transac­
tion. Yet this young person's phenotype is already very much shaped by what
parents and kin ha,·e done. In earlier human environments, the assistance of
kin would continue to be very relevant. A young person's entire reproductive
future would depend upon what group members (mostly kin) could and
would provide.
    The mother-infant relationship already has factored into it a great deal of
rcle,·ant input from the surrounding world, including how much support the
mother can expect from her mate and kin around her. Depending on whether
we are talking about a matrilocal or a patrilocal society, either the mother's
or the father's status and kin ties affected the status of the child. For example,
status of kin might determine such a major life circumstance as whether or
not he or she remained in that group or migrated out of it. 6
    To support her argument that peers (not parents) socialize children, Har­
ris cites case studies from two ends of the social spectrum. She asks us to con­
sider the son of Polish immigrants who learns to speak idiomatic, unaccented
English just like his peers, and the son of a British baronet who spends his first
eight years being tended by governesses with a variety of accents, then goes
to preparatory school, and from there on to Eton. In spite of having virtually
no contact with his father, she notes, the boy learns to speak and act just like
him, providing the young man "his membership card for belonging to the
               ,7
upper c1 ass.
    But there is an important difference between these examples: the immi­
grant child has a big incentive to adopt the language of peers. This child could
not have failed to notice how poorly treated and disenfranchised his parents
were. By contrast, the son of a baronet saw everyone around deferring to his
father. Each child then took the course open to him for attaining "cultural
success" in the world around him. In nonhuman primates, the object of status
can be fairly narrowly defined (gaining access to desired resources), and is
almost always correlated with reproductive success. This is no longer neces­
sarily true for humans. Nevertheless, the aristocrat's son will be predisposed
to emulate his socially prestigious father, to mimic the clipped linguistic
habits of his peers, rather than learn to speak in the Irish lilt of his nannies.
Even if he subsequently goes on to school in America, the baronet's son-
                                        '
                         AN  JNFANT       S-EYE     VIEW
new peers' accents notwithstanding-will continue to talk like his dad so
long as people respect him more for doing so.
    In an example closer to home, when my sister went to live in westTexas,
he1· son picked up a strong twang-essential for a manly identity in that part
of the vmrld. However, my nieces-who went to the same schools, with
peers from the same background-continued to talk just like their mother,
with only the faintest trace of aTexas accent. I assume this was because speak­
ing without a drawl seemed more refined, which would be a desirable trait
for a y oung lady. Between their natal homes and their peers, the child­
ren were actiYc agents, consciously and unconsciously deciding whom to
emulate.
    In all these examples, parental effects (which include children's percep­
tions of how others treat their parents) are critically important. This would
have been even more true in small foraging communities. In worlds where it
would be uncommon in the extreme for children to find themselves in large
classes of same-age peers, and where technology and culture changed at an
infinitesimally slow pace, whether one was an orphan or the son of a skillful
hunter, related to no one or related to many, would shape that child's life
choices. From the perspective of an infant in humanity's environment of evo­
lutionary relevance, there was only one really meaningful question to ask
about nurture-- -would it be forthcoming? "Will I be protected and provided
for, or not?"
    Surviving Detachment
Mothers vary in what they arc able to provide to infants, and infants vary in
viability. But mothers also vary in how much they are willing to commit to
give to each infant. This variation in maternal investment produced selection
pressure on infants to elicit as much care and commitment from their moth­
ers as they could.
   To discourage maternal retrenchment, all human infants seek to maintain
a close and, if possible, continuous association with their mothers. Any seri­
ous deviations from this "normal," species-ty pical pattern (namely, frequent
or prolonged absences) lead to the responses Bowlby called "insecure attach­
ment"      a state he regarded as an abnormal outcome.
    If separation from the people infants are attached to occurs frequently
enough, and persists long enough, Bowlby feared that resulting insecurities
would lead to pathological development. In the 19�os, when he was propos-
              ALTERNATE        PATHS OF        DEVELOPMENT                    S"I7
ing this model, the idea of an Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness was
itself new. No attention was paid to the possibility that there might have been
fluctuating circumstances, or more than one adaptive path, depending on the
conditions during infant de,·elopment. Insecure attachment to the mother
was assumed to he maladaptive, period.
    It never occurred to the first generation of attachment theorists that high
proportions of insecurely attached infants (ranging as high as 30 to So per­
cent in some populations studied) could be anything other than aberrations
produced by unnatural rearing conditions in the modern world. But the fact
is, no one knows what proportion of insecure1y attached infants existed dur­
ing the most relevant periods of human prehistory, when the genetic makeup
of our ancestors was being forged. Were a fraction of orphans survivors?
Were some abandoned infants rescued? How many survived? Were there
"espositos" with character traits especially suited to surviving separation from
their mother and growing up among alloparents?
    Survivors of Abandonment in PrehistoricTimes
By definition, we have no history of what happened during prehistory. But we
have tiny windows into this murky past that provide hints for interpreting
evidence from historical times. We know, for example, from DNA analysis of
the human genome, that the human species passed through at least one major
and prolonged population bottleneck. In some areas, populations experi­
enced multiple population busts and booms. Furthermore, we also know that
such crashes almost always strike disproportionately the old and the very
young. So which infants survived after such a demographic calamity?
    W hat more can we know?The effort requires taking some risks. Myths are
slippery sources of information, yet ancient mythology is often the best win­
do·w we have into the experiences and customs of people who lived four
thousand and more years ago. Mothers (we know from Boswell) were already
abandoning infants in significant numbers . It is not far-fetched to think that
some of these children would have survived, as did the expositos whose many
descendants can be found today by flipping the pages of a phone book.
    Heracles-better known by his Roman name, Hercules-is perhaps the
most famous exposito of all time. According to the first century B. c. account in
Diodorus Siculus, he was abandoned at birth, found, briefly suckled, and
returned to his mother by Hera because he seemed such a robust baby. Hera­
des grew up to be a risk-taking loner who wandered about Greece killing his
                                       '
                       AN   INFANT S-EYF.          VIEW
enemies with a club and his bare hands. In another age, such a man would be
viewed as more nearly a sociopath than a hero. And even in the ancient world
people found appalling the story in which clouds descend upon his mind and
Heracles murders his nephew, six of his own sons, and two other boys who
happened to get in the way. Yet it never occurred to any of the ancients
to blame the behavior of this sociopathic loner on his mother. Heracles,
whose name literally means "fame of Hera," is linked for all posterity not with
the mother who abandoned him but with the goddess Hera, who plotted
against him.
    I take the Heracles myth to be more than a fanciful story. Although the vast
majority of abandoned children would have died, a few would have survived
the dismal rearing conditions of a foundling. Based on what we currently
know, there is no basis for assuming that all children in the past who survived
and reproduced were necessarily securely attached.
    Since Bowlby formulated his attachment theory, anthropologists and his­
torians have learned a great deal more about just how often mothers deviated
from Bowlby's Pleistocene ideal. Many infants were left with allomothers for
extended periods of time. Others were neglected to varying degrees, even
abandoned. Indeed, as we have seen, during some periods of human history,
children were neglected and abandoned on a massive scale. And a broad spec­
trum of maternal distancing resulting in outcomes less drastic than abandon­
ment must have been even more common.
    It requires far-fetched, special pleading to argue that what went on ten
thousand years ago was completely different from what goes on among
nomadic foragers and semisedcntary forager-horticulturalists today, or among
those chronicled in a mythology over three thousand years ago. In prehistoric
as in historical times, some fraction of infants would have been neglected,
even abandoned, and some of these would have been adopted by others as
substitute children, or else exploitively reared for their labor, or (in the case
of females) their reproductive potential. What if children with some traits
were more likely to survive less-than-ideal child-rearing than others?
    No doubt infants without committed mothers usually succumbed to pre­
dation or starvation, as Bowlby assumed. But there is no reason to think that
evolutionary provisions for extreme neglect exist. Even when neglected
infants in post-Neolithic worlds do manage to subsist "protected" (or ware­
housed) inside walled buildings called orphanages, these infants, left un­
tended, scarcely touched, rocking themselves clay after clay, do not develop
              ALTERNATE           PATHS    Or   DEVELOPMENT                  5"19
basic human sensory, motor, linguistic, or emotional potentials. Neverthe­
less, O\'Cr a vast stretch of unrecorded history (ten? twenty? fifty thousand
years?) some percentage of children survived rearing conditions that fell
somewhere between lethally inadequate and the Pleistocene ideal.
    Precise data on infanticide have never been easy to come by. It is even
more difficult to estimate, and impossible to measure, the effects on infant
survival of mothers who cut hack to varying degrees in maternal investment.
An infant who died in an epidemic might not have done so had its mother
nursed him a month longer. Or perhaps the toddler would not have stumbled
into the fire if she had carried him with her that day. Unfortunately, such con­
tingent possibilities don't make for hard data. The behavior of mothers who
provide for their infants less well than they might (surely an immeasurable
quantity!), who delegate care to others with some unknowable prospect that
their children will be adequately cared for, arc literally "off the record." Nor
is there any way to measure the impact on subsequent survival of children of
the various tactics parents might use to reduce the costs of rearing them.
    What we can be certain of is that infanticide (ranging from rare to com­
mon) has characterized human societies throughout history and prehistory.
Less-than-fully -committed mothers and mothers who delegated care to
others were even more common.
    Whether a mother is single-mindcdly attentive, a bit distracted, over­
whelmed, or absent altogether conveys a great deal of information to an in­
fant, not only about what he or she can expect during infancy, but-barring
some miracle-after weaning as well. Almost by definition, a mother well
provided for by her mate, or surrounded by supportive alloparents, will be
investing more in her infant, and her infant can expect to rely on this network
through childhood, adolescence, and perhaps into adulthood.
    Hamilton's rule figures just as strongly in humans as it docs in other ani­
mals, and affects us both in body (our physiological capacity for recognizing
the smell of kin) and in mind (the emphasis on kinship in all human cultures).
There is no good, intuitive reason to expect humans to differ from other ani­
mals in this respect. It would behoove a man no less than a baboon to pursue
different de,·elopmental and reproductive strategies according to social cir­
cumstances.
    Scientifically, the case has so far been impossible to prove, because human
lives arc shaped by so very many variables. The task is rendered even more
complicated by cultural customs. For example, gender- and age-specific
                                       '

clothing and age-graded segregation of children in schools may make chil­
dren seem more similar than they are. It is important, then, to make a clear
distinction between what has been demonstrated in other creatures and
what, beginning in the 1 98os, a handful of emlutionary-minded social scien­
tists began to suspect might be going on in humans. A novel question was being
asked: Did human children evolve difTerent ways of coping with the varying
social environments they encountered?
    The Post-Bowlby Era of AttachmentTheory
Patricia Draper was a graduate student in anthropology at Harvard when she
first went, in   1968, to the field to study the !Kung San. At that time the
!Kung still lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers, and D raper planned to do a
Ph.D. thesis on how their social structure afTected relations between adults
and children. Scholarly attention was still focused on the question of whether
prior to the seventeenth century people even had a concept of childhood.
Like many anthropologists who had studied child-rearing in traditional soci­
eties, Draper found such ideas hard to accept. Still, she wanted to know
more about just what it meant to be a child in a hunter-gatherer environ­
ment.
    At first she focused on how mother-infant relations were influenced by
ecology and social structure. Gradually her interest expanded to include
emotional development.
    Over the next twenty y ears, Pat Draper, following the lead of Richard
Lee, studied the transition of the ! Kung from a nomadic Pleistocene lifestyle
to settled living amidst other African villagers, where older children play a
major role in rearing younger ones. By that time, Draper had become a pro­
fessor and had three children of her own. For Draper, Bowlby's concept of an
Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness remained important, but she no
longer expected that environment to be everywhere the same. Her environ­
ments of evolutionary relevance were typically arduous locales, character­
ized by fluctuations of drought and plenty. For children, resource availability
not only varied with the climate and the availability of game, hut with their
social resources, as people came and went, as kin networks were decimated
or expanded.
    "A problem for scientists who view modern humans from the vantage
point of the adaptive legacy," Draper told me, "is that they do not know very
much about the way people lived 3o,ooo or 4o,ooo years ago, when anatom-
             ALTERNATE PATHS               01:'  DEVELOPMENT                 ,21
ically modern humans were spreading in such a rapid way over much of the
globe." For a child growing up in one of these fluctuating environments, dif­
ferences could be as great as night and day, depending on whether the father
stayed around or left, whether the mother struggled on her own or turned to
family, or what kind of baby-sitters were available.
    Bowlby had assumed that drastic departures from the circumstances of the
Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (such as separation from mother
in infancy) would lead to aberrant adjustments. Draper was not so sure. After
long discussions, she and her then husband, biological anthropologist and
geneticist Henry Harpending, hypothesized different developmental trajec­
tories that would be more or less adaptive for a child, depending on circum­
stances.
    Both were struck by similarities and differences between children's life
experiences in middle-class American families and those in various parts of
Africa. "There were all these assumptions that derive from our own Victorian
past concerning what children need and what women need," Draper told me.
    Our own culture has been characterized by intense emotional bonds
    between mother and offspring. Children look up to their parents as
    providers. But if children are weaned earlier, or cared for by peers and
    other caretakers nutritively and psychologically, and farmed out into
    larger, more diffuse and less diffuse groups of child-rearers, it will be
    a different experience. Children will come to different conclusions
    about what the goodies are and where to get them. 8
    Draper and Harpending hypothesized that children would mature at dif­
ferent rates and develop different styles of coping with the social world,
depending on whether they had learned to rely on their parents or on peers.
They speculated that a child's perception of the availability of resources, and
the most effective way of obtaining them, elicited different ways of respond­
ing in social situations, investing in reciprocal relationships, or trying to
cajole or manipulate others into helping them. This was learning, but learn­
ing of a special kind. As in the acquisition of language, children are born with
"learning biases" that at some life phases cause them to learn some tactics ami
skills more easily than others. "We now realize that the individual organism
does not come equipped with a generalized capacity to learn anything in the
way of response to cues that are coupled with different rewards and punish-
                                      1
                       AN INFANT S-EYE VIEW
ments. Instead," they wrote, "there is a growing understanding that natural
selection has shaped the central nervous system to promote the 'ease of
learning,' certain responses which themselves are conducive to survival and
ultimately the reproduction of the individual."9
    Increasingly concerned about the extent to which psychologists were ide­
alizing Bowlby's "Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness," an emerging
group of sociobiologically influenced researchers in human development­
including Draper and Jay Belsky, Michael Lamb, Jim Chisholm, and Mary
Main-accepted Bowlby's evolutionary framework for how infants attach to
their caretakers but began to diverge from Bowlby concerning how uniform
ancient worlds, and how variable human adaptations to them, were."(l)n light
of current theory in evolutionary biology," declared a 1985 consortium of
scholars, including child psychologist Lamb and the life-history theoretician
Eric Charnov, "it is not easy to designate some behaviors as adaptive, others
maladaptive. There is no species-appropriate pattern of behavior against
which all other patterns can be evaluated."To them, infants come equipped
with a flexible repertoire, depending on the specific environment in which
they live. Viewed from this perspective, it became critical to specify how alter­
native patterns might be adaptive under what caregiving circumstances. This
challenge marked the beginning of the post-Bowlby era of attachment theory.
It brought with it a new awareness of naturally occurring variation within the
               10
same species.
    This marriage of sociobiology and child development is redefining what
we mean by "normal," replacing the older notion of species-typical develop­
ment with an awareness of"developmental trajectories" that are adaptive for
coping with the circumstances at hand. This new perspective is already lead­
ing to novel interpretations.
    As early as 1981, Mary Main was already beginning to wonder about
infants who avoid looking at their caretakers. Earlier researchers took for
granted that avoidance must be pathological. Now, Main postulated that
avoidance might be an adaptive tactic for infants to cope with parents who
routinely reject them. She used the "strange situation" to identify particular
infants who on reencountering the person to whom they were most strongly
attached would avert their gaze and perhaps move away, avoiding precisely
the person who common sense tells us should he the foremost object of
desire and concern. Such cases had always seemed puzzling and counterintu­
itive.

is probably the first published description of the childhood behavior termed "avoidance": "I saw
the first s ymptom of shyness in my child when nearly two years and three months old: this was
shown towards myself, after an absence of ten days from home , chiefly by his eyes being kept
slightly averted from mine; but he soon came and sat on my knee and kissed me, and all trace of
shyness disappeared." (Courtesy '![Darwin Museum, Do...n flouse, and Enalish fleritaae PhatO[Jraphic Library)

ent in order to conceal angry reactions that might jeopardize their ability to
maintain this all-impor tant relationship. She called the response "avoidance in
the service of attachment."

.P4                    AN     INFANT S-EYE VIEW
Born to Rebel by Frank Sulloway. Although Sulloway never mentions "poly­
phenisms," he is in fact focused on the same dichotomy as Erick Greene in his
research on early - and late-hatched caterpillars: the development of quite dif­
ferent morphs in response to the different resources available to early-born
versus later-born offspring. The difference is that Sulloway's morphs involve
                           11
different personal styles.
    Sulloway argues that firstborn children are advantaged early on by their
monopoly on parental attention, and later on by their greater size and matu­
rity, which allows them to dominate later-born siblings. When magnified by
parental preferences for older children or by such institutional elaborations
of their advantage as preferential inheritance by firstborn offspring, firstborn
children have every reason to identify with parents and with the authority of
the social system, while the later-born have every reason to feel aggrieved,
to chafe and rebel at the injustice of this resource allocation-to question
authority rather than identify with it.

figures), Sulloway was able to show distinctive patterns in which firstborns
were more likely to identify with and defend the status quo, while later­
horns (those "born to rebel") were more likely to challenge the status quo
and endorse revolutionary ideas. Siblings become different in the course of
development by internalizing quite different working models about how they
expect (and would like) the world to work. This internalization of a model of
the world based on early experience is Bowlbian to the core.
    A wanted child would learn to expect very different treatment, espe­
cially different levels of support, compared to a less wanted child. Anthro­
pologist Nancy Levine, who worked among Tibetan-speaking farmers,
herders, and traders in northwestern Nepal, tells the story of a woman who
had nine children, two sons and seven daughters. Both of the sons died,
while three daughters survived. The last-born of all her children was a girl.
The experience of bearing another daughter after losing her two sons made
the mother "so furious" that at first she refused to feed her. But the baby did
not die, and relatives and friends finally prevailed upon the mother to feed
her. The mother's bitterness, however, resurfaced in her refusal to interact
with the child or even name her. The girl was given a series of abusive epi­
thets. One of her nicknames was "Ready -to-die," which in fact she did not
do. Instead, she matured into a healthy, if rather quiet, child.12 The point of

this sad story is that a wanted son and an unwanted daughter might experi­
ence a mother's care I'C'J' differently, as differently as if they had been born
to different species, or horn in quite different habitats. Yet somehow, some
unwanted children (like "Ready-to-die") do manage to survive, albeit
stunted to varying degrees, emotionally and physically. Whereas the first­
born son would grow up with a working model of a world in which those
around him seck to help him out, the last-horn girl would feel just the
opposite.
    T his sensitivity to intraspecific variation is reflected in a recent summary
statement on child-rearing by Jay Belsky and colleagues at Penn State: "Meet­
ing children's emotional and social demands in a supportive responsive man­
ncr fosters a social orientation that values mutually beneficial interactions
and relationships, whereas patterns of rearing that are negative, inconsiderate
and coercive lead children to behave in ways that are self-centered."11 Chil­
dren with "negative, inconsiderate and coercive" caretakers will be those
born to parents who did not want them, or else reared by exploitive allopar­
ents. Such children could not realistically grow up to expect much help from
others, or to find an advantageous niche for themselves within local kin net­
works.
    In a foraging context, it might be highly adaptive for an avoidantly
attached individual to learn to downplay love, to dismiss the importance of
close human relationships, which would not in any event be forthcoming.
Rather than rely on those around him, the most advantageous course open
might he for the child to become self-reliant and to avoid developing empa­
thetic feeling for others around him, unlikely to behave like committed kin.
    "Wretched" Developmental Courses
T he term wretched derives from the Old English wrecche, for exile, literally a
person without kin nearby, dehumanized by circumstances. No one could be
more kinless or in this sense more wretched than an abandoned infant . Yet
heroic tales from antiquity abound with stories about such wretches. Famous
foundlings include Hcraclcs, Oedipus, Paris, and Hcracles' own abandoned
son, Telephos (see Plate 5).
    just after birth, Tclcphos's mother, a priestess to Athena, hid him in a
thicket, where he was suckled by a doc. For such a child, growing up like a
foundling, brought up by strangers, it might well he adaptive for him to
dcYclop into an aggressive loner. When, as a young adult, Telephos is

Fig. 2 3· 2 In his Retour de Nourrice Jean-Baptiste Greuze ( 172�- 18os) depicts the weaned child's
return from the wet nurse . As the mother reaches for the child, he avoids her gaze. My guess
is that Greuze's model for the child in this portrait was a child who had been separated from
his mother for only a relatively short period, for he docs not treat the mother like a com­
plete stranger. Or perhaps there has been enough contact between mother and infant while the
child was at the wet nurse for him to have the sense that she is a special figure. The painting
remains a poignant evocation of the cfTect on children of ruptured attachments. (Courtc � � Biblio­

Tclephos takes the king's son hostage to extort his help. For a kinless human,
little is likely to he profl'crcd, and goods must he snatched, secretly stolen,
won by guile or daring heroic exploits. Such human relationships as might be
available arc likely to be on terms exceedingly disadvantageous to the kinless

wretch. There \Yould lw no kin to anangc a marriage or proYide wherew ithal
for a bride-price. EYen mating would be out of reach, except perhaps through
rape. In terms of Hamilton's n1le (Cost to donor must he less than benefit to
a recipient related by r,  C < Br), there might as well be no r, no degree of
relatedness, in his internalized equation, only perceived benefits and calcu­
latl'd costs. For a human, especially a child, it is the most dismal imaginable
situation. Thus a certain type of sociopathic personality, forged out of desper­
ate circumstances, though highly undesirable from society's point of view,
might from the de,·cloping child's perspective be a way of making the best of
an appalling situation.
    To date, the hypothesis that the personalities of infants who arc avoidant
and inner-directed, or who develop to be manipulative, exploitative, and
self-centered, might once have been adaptive for coping with wretched cir­
cumstances has failed to generate predictions that arc testable-at least not
testable in any way sufficiently ethical to get past human subjects review
hoards. \Ve know little about how avoidant attachments are played out in
men's reproductive adaptations, even less about women's, and are only
beginning to learn how these histories play out in the formation of adult rela­
tionships. Documenting the emergence of a personality deficient in empa­
thy-what we often mean by "sociopathic"-is problematic. Long-lived and
multifaceted, humans are difficult to study, and there are daunting ethical
constraints (which is as it should be).
    There are numerous practical reasons why we know so much more about
alternate deYclopmental states in caterpillars than we do in children-rea­
sons that go far, far beyond the greater complexity of the latter. Given how
undesirable "sociopaths" arc from society's point of view, there is a real risk
that studying certain types of people might lead to stigmatization of certain
children.
    What Makes Us Human?
By the third trimester a fetus can hear noises beyond the womb, can process
affectiYe quality of the speech, and differentiate whether mother or someone
else is speaking. This provides the fetus his first clues about the world. It
marks the beginning of feeling "embedded" in a social network and the sensa­
tion of belonging that gradually develops, after birth, into the capacity to
experience empathetic feelings for others. The capacity to combine such feel­
ings with our uniquely human ability to guess what someone else must be

terrorist. Suffering from a festering wound, he has no kin to help him. Depicted as scrawny man
(on left), he attempts to force King Agamemnon to help him heal his wound by holding the king's
son hostage . According to Diodorus Siculus, the desperate Tclephos exclaims: "I will kill your son
unless you cure me!"-a credible threat, coming as it docs from a wretch unrelated to his
defenseless victim. 14 (l.uconion krater attributed to Policoro, co. 400 B.C. Courte9' �the Cl6tlonJ Museum)
thinking and feeling is the main difference between humans and other ani­
mals. As Har vard psychologist Marc Hauser likes to sum it up, what distin­
guishes humans from other apes is our "ability to put ourselves emotionally
and cognitivcly in someone else's shoes."15
    It is this ability to imaginatively construct the way others think and feel
that takes us beyond mere empathetic awareness (say, of an offspring's grief at
the death of its mother) and beyond mere strategic manipulation of another's
behavior. A chimp, for example, is quite capable of giving a false food call that
              ALTERNATE PATHS               01' DEVELOPMENT                  )29
leads another animal away from a hidden food source, allowing the deceiver
to return later for the plunder. Chimps, as well as many animals that hunt for
a Jiying, show an uncanny ability to read intentions and guess what other ani­
mals will do. Chimps arc quite capable of consciously calculating certain
kinds of costs and anticipating benefits. They can even anticipate the cost­
                                                      16
benefit decisions other animals arc likely to make.
    But humans go a step further. They combine these analy tical capacities
with new ones-like being able to imagine the future. Even more important,
they arc able to translate hunches about how another animal will react into
full-scale speculation about what others are thinking, and articulate their
concerns both to themselves and to others. In this way, humans transform
ingenious capacities of observation into the sophisticated capacity to care
what happens to others, even those they have never met.
    From whence such gifts? Unfortunately, in the case of minimal levels of
human empathy, we know the answer. As with all primates, infants who grow
up without social contact, with no one to touch, hold, cuddle, with neither
mother nor allomother to reassure them of their commitment to the infant's
well-being-these infants fail to proceed along the developmental pathway
that is the essential first step for development of this uniquely human sensibil­
ity. Such people may grow up brimming with analy tical abilities, even uncan­
nily able to anticipate what other humans will do. But they lack the capacity
to hook up the cognitive and emotional components of human potential.
In many cultures the word for one's own group is the word for "humans."
Humans are, by definition, those people like oneself, and also likely to be
those people one is most closely related to. People not like oneself, especially
enemies with widely divergent self-interests, arc defined as "other-than­
human."
    There is a nricty of preconceptions about what makes us human, and
people tend to hold very tightly to their own views on this subject. My own
favorite effort to encapsulate in words the features that make us human
appear at the conclusion of lshi in Tivo Worlds, Theodora Krocber's poignant
account of the life of thc"last surviving wild Indian in North America."
     On August 29, 191 1, a starving Native American materialized outside a
slaughterhouse in Oroville, California. Although still a y oung man, he had
                                          '
                        AN    INFANT S-EYE          VIEW
outlived every other person in his tribe, most of whom were murdered by
those who wanted to rid the country of people of his race. Yet somehow, in
spite of inestimably cruel and inhumane treatment of his people, Ishi navi­
gated this "sudden, lonely, and unmitigated change-over from the Stone Age
to the Steel Age" with his humanity intact to demonstrate that Homo sapiens,
    whether contemporary American Indian or Athenian Greek . . . is
    quite simply and wholly human in his biology, in his capacity to learn
    new skills and new way s as a changed environment exposes him to
    them, in his power of abstract thought, and in his moral and ethical dis­
    criminations. It is upon this broad base of man's panhumanity that sci­
    entists and humanists alike predicate further progress away from the
    instinctual and primitive subhuman strata of our natures. 17
    Confronted with the most appalling possible life circumstances, isolated
with neither kin nor peers, Ishi exhibited a well-honed understanding of the
social contract, a scrupulous sense of fairness and concern for others. Against
all odds this dignified and nobly mannered man with the "flashing, friendly
smile" adapted to an alien world by forging friendships that were character­
ized by genuine concern for the feelings of people who belonged to a very
different race and era. The source of his abiding nobility was his own inter­
nalized moral values, personal standards of correct versus incorrect behavior.
    Such sensibilities could scarcely be attributed to the world around him.
Most who met Ishi would see in him little more than a freak from another
era. Where rehabilitation through selective kindness has been tried on people
lshi's age, the results are rarely positive. So what made Ishi so special? Simply
put, he was orphaned late enough. His adult life was spent hiding from geno­
cidal cowboy s who sought to kill him, who had already killed his immediate
family and remaining people. But prior to that terror, his early experiences
included being part of a community. What made Ishi human derived from his
early sense of belonging to a group of kin committed to his well-being.
    Practical Implications
No doubt some people are born innately dcf1cient in the potential to develop
compassion. But what interests me here is the possibility that some portion of
noncompassionatc people arc not horn that way. Rather they have responded
adaptively to signals in their early upbringing. These cues alert the infant that
             ALTERNATE          PATHS    01:' DEVELOPMENT                   5"31
one of Mother Nature's worst-case scenarios is about to befall him: he will
ha,·c no mother or adequate substitute for one, and no supportive kin net­
work. Under these circumstances, lack of compassion might well be an adap­
tive (or once adaptive) response. This hypothesis is consistent with evidence
that secure attachments early in life have long-lasting effects, not so much on
temperament or cognitive capacities as on degree of empathy for others.
    At present we arc only making educated guesses, yet the stakes seem ter­
ribly high, as countries like the United States pour money into prisons while
itwcsting proportionally far less in early development programs designed to
convince infants and children that they belong to a community that will treat
them like kin. lB These arc the circumstances that signal a developing human
organism that it will be worthwhile to grow up caring about what happens to
others, and to behave as if those others might he kin.

That message may not be very comforting either. (Indeed, "Hushabye," for
today's more common "Rockabye," may be a distant corruption of an old
French warning that a wolf is ncar: "He bas, Ia le loup"). 1
    Childhood Fears
Most parents reading this book would regard lightning striking as more prob­
able than that they might neglect or place in danger a baby in their care. ("The
parental instinct drives us to nurture our children to the utmost of our abil­
ity," reads a just-published medical text. ) 2
    The assumption that ambivalent parents (especially mothers) must be
abnormal is one reason selection pressures on infants to elicit their commit­
ment have received so little attention. It may also be the reason maternal
ambivalence has for so long remained a preserve of psychoanalysts (who
study the odd) rather than of evolutionists (who study the natural).
    "If anyone had suggested, when I started my psychoanalytic practice some
hventy-five years ago that my patients would fear that l-or their parents­
might kill them, I think I might have responded with shock. I might even have
rejected it as somebody's nightmare," wrote psychoanalyst Dorothy Bloch.
Bloch drew on her entire professional experience to document her prepos­
terous-sounding claim that all the children she treated feared being killed by
their parents and employed a wide range of fantasies and self-deceptions to
make themselves feel safe. 3
    I doubt that all, or even most, children live in a state of chronic fear. How­
ever, I am convinced that Dr. Bloch provides insights into the self-protective
fantasies devised by insecurely attached children (perhaps the young patients
most likely to end up in her office). Such infants have caught whiffs of ambiva­
lence, detected hints that their mother might (figuratively or really) with­
draw or go away. The promise of current and future care, something more
than just maintaining proximity, is a central preoccupation of immatures; it is
also critical for social and physical growth .
    From an infant's perspective, there is a critical distinction between being
cared for by multiple familiar, as-if-kin caretakers, and being abandoned to
the less-committed care of strangers-or, worst of all, abandoned altogether.
Herein lies an important practical tip for mothers, what I think of as Bowlby's
first law of maternal freedom: convince your toddler that he is the one who
wants to leave you to play with someone else, not vice versa; or see to it ahead

of time that baby is comfortable with the baby-sitter, that he sees the sitter as
surrogate kin, part of his extended family. The extra time it takes will be
more than repaid by case of the transition.
    A securely attached infant is an infant secure about his world in general,
present and future. A secure infant is far more comfortable, even in his
mother's absence, than an infant in doubt about his mother's commitment. It
is not turning an infant over to allomothcrs that has harmful repercussions. It
is failing to convince him or her that abandonment is out of the question.
    First Steps to Security
Yes, there is bondage here. But the nature of the conspiracy is different from
the one women were demonstrating against down King's Parade when
Bowlby received his honorary degree. From an infant's point of view, the
period between birth and the onset of lactation, some days later, remains
fraught with significance. Not because there is a "critical period" during
which a mother either bonds with her infant or fails to, hut because her prox­
imity is an essential first step to lactation and the ensuing processes that forge
powerful tics between mother and hahy. A mother closer on day one is more
                    DEVISING         BETTER       LULLABIES                   5H
likely to want to remain close on day two, be driven to remain close on day
three, and so on.
    The past few decades have witnessed a long, pointless, and ill-informed
debate o\·cr whether or not women have "maternal instincts." Given the his­
torical context, the battle lines were understandable. The early literature on
the biology of motherhood was built on patriarchal assumptions introduced
by earlier generations of moralists. What was essentially wishful thinking on
their part was substituted for objective observation. It has taken a long time
to correct these errors and revise old biases, to "raise Darwin's conscious­
ness" and widen the evolutionary paradigm to include both sexes. But by the
time this happened, feminists, social historians, and philosophers were
already convinced that they knew what evolutionists had to offer, that it was
necessarily flawed, determinist, and uninsightful. Natural selection, and with
it the most powerful and comprehensive theory available for understanding
the basic natures of mothers and infants, was rejected, as social scientists and
feminists took another route. That path, which led away from science, led
them to reject biology altogether and construct alternative origin stories,
their own ,·ersions of wishful thinking about socially constructed men and
women, and infants born with more nearly a desire for mothers than a need.
Mother love could safely be interpreted then as a "gift" consciously bestowed,
or as a by-product of changing fashions in sentiment. In the meantime, biolo­
gists were developing a more multifaceted view of mothers, featuring flexi­
ble actors •.vhose responses were contingent on circumstances. But how were
feminists- long ago embarked upon an alternate itinerary-to know?
    Lost in the shuffie over what it was natural for mothers to do and dust-ups
over "bonding" and mother love, was the infant's often noisy two cents'
worth: "No matter who gives it, I need it. And I need it now. Not when
grown-ups sort out where it comes from. But now. Don't care if it's quality
time or some other time. NOW."
    More than anyone before him, it was John Bowlby who, at a theoretical
level, addressed this need. Bowlby provided scientific legitimacy to the anxi­
ety, distress, terror, and, finally, desolation that infants experience when they
fail to detect "the meeting eyes of love."What is it infants so dread? he asked.
    Many of the dangers turn out to he different from those Bowlby initially
envisioned. Maternal alternatives to caring for their own infants were more
varied than he realized. But Bowlby's central explanation of how and why
infants become attached to their caretakers was on target.
                                         '
                        AN INFANT S-EYE             VIEW
    In a modest addendum to Bowlby, then, I would argue that infants strive
for attachment to their mothers not only to stay close lest something pounce,
but also to stave off the possibility of maternal retrenchment, and forestall it
in any of the manifold forms it takes, ranging from mild negligence to aban­
donment. Babies are geared to making sure that maternal care is forthcoming
and ongoing. Among humans, protection from predators comes as a bonus
from maintaining this even more crucial attachment.
    Toward this end, infant connoisseurs of mothering are designed as they
are. Every trait, every nuance to a trait that made this more likely, was
selected for. Over tens of thousands of years, any infant whose lusciousness
was detectably less, also proved ever so slightly less likely to survive. Robust­
ness, plumpness, cuteness were not just useful physiological attributes. They
were signals to the mother that the benifit function in Hamilton's equation
was well worth whatever cost it might entail for a mother to care for her
infant. That infants, if they are to get the care they need, must be so plump
and adorable is a reminder of the dreadful bottlenecks and close calls that the
survivors who became our ancestors passed through.
    In addition to these bonny inducements to get themselves picked up,
infants also need innate diagnostic skills. Once proximity is achieved, it is
their job to make the most of it by rooting for the mother's nipple, latching
on, and sucking. Being attached to one's mother, not incidentally, also initi­
ates and then maintains lactation, with the attendant cascade of physiological
consequences in the mother, suffusing her body with a sense of well-being,
overriding inhibitions she might feel about her unfamiliar passenger.
   The Sensual Responses Babies Produce
As pursed lips clamp tightly onto her nipples and tug, the little head gives a
jerk, like a fish on a line whose movement secures the hook. But in this
instant, just who is it that is being caught? Within moments, maternal cortisol
levels subside; oxytocin courses through her veins. As if she were getting a
massage, the mother's blood pressure decreases, oxytocin suffuses her (if all
goes well) in a beatific calm that lulls her normal inhibitions about being so
close to a stranger. If she allows it to happen, close contact with this baby
docs indeed transform her mindset and produces in her a need to be close to
her baby, a need to smell her baby that, for some women (true in my case),
borders on addiction. Whether or not this constitutes a gift given-and rc-

ciprocatcd-- or bondage, depends on what else a mother wants to be doing,
and who is there to help.
    Once nursing begins, bondage is a perfectly good description for the
ensuing chain of events. The mother is endocrinologically, sensually, as well as
neurologically transformed in ways likely to serve the infant's needs and con­
tribute to her own posterity. As her mammary glands go into production, it
will he a long time before she is again emotionally and physiologically so at
libertY to cut bait .
      .I
    From that point on, a mother (especially one without a breast pump) lives
on a mammary leash. Levels of prolactin arc raised, emotional bonding has
begun, aided and abetted by that inhibition-lowering, affiliation-inducing,
calming surge of oxytocin. Absence may or may not make her heart grow
fonder (though it usually will). What absence will always do, though, is cause
her nipples to itch, tingle, and eventually ache.
    Docs a mother consciously desire to suckle her baby? Many probably do.
But once the milk supply builds up (and Mother Nature has designed babies
to ensure that it does) a mother, whatever her emotional state, will be ad­
,·erscly conditioned, tortured really, if she fails to. She becomes addicted to
the act of nursing as well as to the baby herself. At the first cry of hunger, a
lactating mother immediately recognizes her own infant's cry and warm
secretions drip from her mammae, as if she were some long-ago platypus
wanting nothing more than to hole up in a den someplace and let this baby
suckle. As the baby sucks, the mother experiences an exquisite relief from
the pressure of milk that has built up in her glands. The baby sucking on the
receiving end of this let-down reflex brings with it pleasurable sensations,
bordering on and blending into the erotic.
    Whether or not the earth moves, these are powerfully conditioning
sensations. To classify maternal sensations as "sexual," and therefore in puri­
tanical minds to condemn them, is to privilege sexuality in a very nonpuri­
tanical way, implying that sexual sensations are more important than equally
powerful sensations that reward women for caring for babies. We might just
as logically describe various orgasmic contractions during lovemaking as
"maternal." These responses by a lactating mother mammal to her baby's
sucking long antedated sexual responsiveness to breast stimulation in hetero­
sexual (or any type of intimate) contacts. Propaganda from androccntric
sources like Playboy notwithstanding , the feelings we identify as sexual were
                                        1
                       AN    1NFANT S-EYE           VIEW
originally maternal. This is why, even in contemporary women, it should not
surprise us that erotic arousal in the mother during breast-feeding can be
correlated with increased milk ejection. 5 For maternity and sexuality are
inseparably linked in ways that just are not true for paternity and male erotic
experience. Sexual desire in men and other male primates evolved because
copulating with females increased the chances their sperm would fertilize an
egg. Having eggs fertilized, however, is just one of the ways that copulating
serves a woman's reproductive ends. Others include the various roles men
play, both positive and negative, in keeping her baby safe and fed.
    Under the circumstances, then, who is say which came first? The eros of
suckling or the erotic sensations of heterosexual adults coupling? I would
guess the former. Not counting gestation, when the infant is still in utero,
mammalian reproduction entails three types of relationships: copulation,
parturition, and nursing. Each one involves participation by two individuals
and involves intense psychophysiological responses to vaginal stimulation or
uterine contractions, and in the case of lovemaking and lactation, significant
breast stimulation, all deeply sensual experiences.
    Maternity is inextricably intertwined with sexual sensations, and it is an
infant's business, through grunts and coos, touches and smells, to make the
most of Mother Nature's reward system, which conditions a woman to make
this infant a top priority. Evolutionary logic is firmly on the side of mothers
who enjoy the sensual side of mothering for its own sake.
    Each moment in proximity enhances the prospect that there will be a next
one, increasing the probability that the mother will remain accessible to
receive the neonate's adorable signals, gradually guaranteeing the mother's
attachment to the increasingly familiar creature nestled against her. Satiated,
drugged by warmth and just a nip of oxytocin lacing the breast milk, the
relaxed infant nestles against mother, their comfortable relationship feeding
upon itself and growing into love.
    We can discard an erroneous notion about how mothers bond to infants in
some critical period right after birth. The window for bonding is fairly open­
ended. Children can be adopted days after birth and loved just as intensely, as
ferociously, as those babies whose bodies passed through their mother's birth
canal and then pressed against her right after birth. It's the window for rela­
tively painless (or only tolerably painful) termination of investment that is
brief-usually in the first seventy-two hours.

    Once established, the influence babies exercise over mothers does not
easily fade. There is a conspiracy, all right, but the enslavement at issue pre­
dates by millions of years the medical and scientific establishments that femi­
nist writers on the subject of the "bonding fiasco" complain about.
    What Babies Seek
The intense, often highly sensual feelings babies produce, and the guilt moth­
ers experience when they notice them, as well as the guilt mothers feel when
they are absent, or when they feel blank or even negatively toward their
babies, have caught the attention of psychoanalysts. Acutely aware of the
ambivalence mothers feel about their slavish devotion to infants, psychoana­
lysts have devoted much attention to the expression of such feelings in sadis­
tic lullabies and fairy tales.
    Yet the same psychoanalysts tend to start out with a baseline presumption
of mother-infant harmony. "For all of us," writes the psychoanalyst Alice
Balint, "it remains self-evident that the interests of mother and child are iden­
tical and it is a generally acknowledged measure of the goodness or badness
of the mother how far she really feels this identity of interests.'16 But the cost
function of Hamilton's rule calls this presumption of harmony into question.
As RobertTrivers, David Haig, and others make clear, the interests of mother
and infant are only identical when they don't differ.
    Instead of viewing it as an abnormality, a pathology to be treated, socio­
biologists accept some degree of maternal ambivalence as inevitable . This
insight, together with an awareness of the underlying sources of maternal
ambivalence, helps make sense of some of the very odd things that mothers
say and sing to children.
    When they were young, I called all my children "sweet potato," "muffin,"
"cutie-pie." I'd say, "You're so adorable I could eat you up." I actually spoke to
them this way. So have many other parents. What on earth could be the point
of all this talk of eating? In retrospect, after a bit of Darwinian self-analysis, I
suppose I really did have flesh on my mind. Soft as rose petals, such delectable
new tissue, so healthy, not to mention parasite-free. But, however delectable,
I am positive that I never had any inclination whatsoever to eat my children
(although I acknowledge desiring more control over them, body and soul,
than their own strong wills were ever inclined to grant). Furthermore, like
the fry of mouth-brooding fish who dart confidently right in and out of
                                              '
                           AN     INFANT S-EYE     VIEW
mother's maw-and do note that, unlike humans, most fish, size permitting,
are highly cannibalistic-my own small fry never seemed the least concerned
about my culinary endearments. They giggled.
    For, as designed by Mother Nature, the delectability of infants seduces to
quite different ends. My children's deliciousness rendered me more willing to
be consumed by them, to give up bodily resources, and in my own contempo­
rary example, most importantly, time-time, time, time, right down to the
last syllable of allocatable time (when I could get no allomother to substi­
tute)-and so to subordinate my own aspirations to their desires so we could
all (more or less) contentedly take our places at posterity's table.
    But around the world, lullabies intended to calm babies often seem to fall
short of the mark. Lurking predators, not to mention strange males (like
"Bonaparte"), or the prospect of maternal ambivalence, are precisely the
threats little primates ought to fear most deeply. What infants yearn for is the
reassurance that they will never lose their caretaker's love, that no matter
what, she (or he) will keep them safe from any lurking hazard. Although
female caretakers are more fluent in high-pitched babyese, and have the
advantage of being able to nurse, and a head start toward becoming the
infant's primary object of desire, fathers should not sell short their own abil­
ity to reassure-or harm. Far better than most, Aaron the Moor, the Shake­
spearean dad desperate to keep his lover from killing their child, understood
the message infants want to hear from anyone who matters when he an­
nounced that "this [babe], before all the world will I keep safe."
    From an infant's point of view the desired message is best summed up by
an Egyptian incantation from the sixteenth century B.C., chanted to forestall
evil spirits covetous of the child, spirits who might otherwise approach under
the cover of dark:
    Hast thou come to kiss this child?
    I will not let thee kiss him!
    Hast thou come to silence him?
    I will not let thee set silence over him!
    I will not let thee injure him!
    Hast thou come to take him away?
                                                7
    I will not let thee take him awayfrom me!
                   DEVISING       BETTER       LULLABIES
   "Ah, there, that's what I call a lullaby. That's the message I want to hear,
see, smell, and touch," the infant doesn't precisely think but, in the old mam­
malian recesses of his brain, emotionally processes to himself as he nestles
against his caretaker's breast, master of his galactic empire, and falls securely
asleep.

      Preface
1.     Sec Genevie and Margolies 198 7: S" for a broad-scale survey asking U.S. women how
they feel about being mothers.More than half of the mothers expressed some ambivalence,
and 20 percent were outright negative and wished that they had not had children. As will be­
come clear in the course of this book, ethnographic and historical evidence makes it unlikely
that the proportion of ambivalent mothers documented for the postindustrial U.S.is an aber­
ration.

3•    According to Dr. Allan Rosenfield of the Columbia School of Public Health, fewer than 1. s
percent of U.S.abortions are performed after 2o weeks, even fewer after the 2 3rd week of preg­
nancy, when there would be around a one-in-four chance that the fetus would be viable outside
the womb.An e\·en smaller fraction would ever be performed using the contested procedure,
perhaps one tenth of 1 percent (Seelye 1997a).
4·     Stolberg 1997a; there arc no agreed upon figures. I accept the estimates cited by Katharine
 Seelye of the New York Times (1997c). Her numbers arc consistent with those that appeared in the
most recent journal if the American Medical Association editorial on this subject where Grimes
(1998) reported that o. 8 to 1.7 percent of all induced abortions performed in the U.S. occurred
after 21 weeks and hence might be called "late term." Of these, only a fraction would be dilation
and extraction. This type of abortion is so rare that the reason for focusing on it can only be to
galvanize public sentiment against abortion in general.
S'·   The National Right to Life Committee, for example, opposes not only abortion, but also the
pill, Depo-Provera, the IUD, and Norplant, because they flush the fertilized egg out of the uterus
prior to implantation (Conniff 1998).

22. Eliot ended her only surviving love letter to Spencer with the provocative observation that "I
suppose no woman ever before wrote such a letter as this -hut I am not ashamed of it."With
characteristic courage, she laid bare her feelings to a degree remarkable in any age, much less for
a woman in a Victorian one: "I want to know if you can assure me that you will not forsake me,
that you will always he with me. . .. If you become attached to someone else, then I must die,
but until then I could gather courage to work and make life valuable if only I had you ncar me. I
do not ask you to sacrilice anything -I would be very glacl and cheerful and never annoy you.
But I find it impossible to contemplate life under any other conditions. If I had your assurance, I
could trust that and live upon it" (from a transcription of the original quoted in Karl 199/j: 146 ) .

24. As Spencer put it years later in his autobiography, "the lack of physical attraction was fatal. "
lie described Eliot as of"ordinary feminine height lbutj strongly built" with a "physique" exhibit­
ing "a trace of that masculinity characterizing her intellect" (cited in Paxton 1 991: 17).
      Note that genes had not yet lwen discovered and Spencer was under the misapprehension
that women got looks froin their mothers, brains from their fathers . By compadson with either
Spenn• r or Darwin, Eliot's intuitions ahout how ht'n'dity works st•em brilliantly prcscknt.She
correctly guessed that physical and mental traits can derive from both parents and sort them­
seh·es out in unpredictable ways .Barred from scienn•, Eliot used her novels as a laboratory in
which to set up fictional matings, experiments that would yield unanticipated personal and
genetic outcomes, ranging from quite comic to tragic- novels that one way or another always
expanded essentialist conceptions of male and female natures.In The Mill on the Floss, for exam­
ple, Eliot has Maggie Tullh-cr's father follow Spcn<·erian ad,·ice to a tee.He married a woman
specifically for her looks and lack of brains, only to find himself the disappointed progenitor of a
clc,·er daughter and a handsome hut plodding son."Did you ewr hear the like on't?" asks Mr.Tul­
lh·er as he lamt'nts what a pity it is that his daughter was so clever since, as he put it, "I picked the
mother hecause she wasn't o'er' cute lm·erly acute!        ·lwin' a good-looking woman too ...hut
I picked her from her sisters o' purpose 'cause she was a hit weak, like.... But you sec when a
man's got brains himself, there's no knowing where they'll run to; an' a pleasant sort o' soft
woman may go on hreeding you stupid lads and 'cute wenches till it's like as if the world was
turned topsy-turvy. It's an uncommon puzzling thing" (Eliot 11!6o: 18).
      Darwin himself explicitly parted <:ompany with Spencer on this one.As far as he was con­
cerned, "men who succeed in obtaining the more beautiful women will not have a better chance
of leadng a long line of descendants than other men with plainer wives . .." (Darwin
  1874: �So). Still, the criteria Spencer used when he turned George Eliot down arc worth pon­
dering, not because of what they tell us about Herbert Spencer's sexual preferences or personal
love map (who cares?) but because of the discrepancy het\wen the theoretical reason Spencer
offered (eugenic ones) and what \H're more probably the real ones.Was it really Eliot's genetic
qualifications for motherhood that bothered Spencer, as ht• said? His stated reason bears closer
examination.Thirty-two when they met, Eliot would haYe still heen fertile, qualified by robust
health, intclligencl', good character, and excellent earning power (bt'tter than Spencer's and
absolutely remarkable for her time).Eliot's more likely ddicit had to do with a heavy-set body
and a constellation of facial features-·--fairly evidently inherited from her father, to whom she
hore a striking resemblance---that made her look hoth masculine and mature beyond her years.

 abortion, and was intrigued by what she heard was going on in America. Note that even though
the population was much smaller, the rate of abortions in the U.S., per woman, was as high or
higher than it is today because there were no other reliable means of birth control (Reagan
 1997). Darwin, who was opposed to birth control (see Desmond and Moore 1991:627-28),
would have had a different view.

indulge in extramarital activities arc those who arc the 'fittest' and most deserving to be biologi­
cal fathers as they must possess a high degree of cunning and initiative, and often physical agility"

5·   In one late 19)0S study of wild langur monkeys, data were collected for as many minutes as
the monkeys behaved "normally." If the bcha,·ior of the animals seemed "abnormal" (and by
"abnormal" was usually meant aggressive behavior toward another animal), the group was
deemed to be in a state of social "diSC(l uilibrium." At that point, the collection of data was halted,
to ensure that only "normal" behavior was recorded. Not surprisingly, the resulting reports
depicted remarkably pacific societies, with every individual a team-player, and mothers con­
firmed in their roles as nurturcrs (jay 1962: chapter 8) .

9•   Many of us were then impressed by a series of experiments with rats at the National Insti­
tutes of Health published in a paper on "Population density and social pathology" (Calhoun
1962). Calhoun, who apparently had the emerging global population crisis and "a chilling possi­
ble end for Man" on his mind, began by citing Malthus on vice, misery, and the limits on popula­
tion growth that nature would inevitably apply to those who outbred their capacity to adapt.
Calhoun described the behavior of"normal" rat mothers, who constructed nests and cared for
their young, and the pathological behaviors of"abnormal" mothers who failed to build nests and
neglected their young. These same studies would be interpreted very differently today. However,
they remain of historical importance.
10.  At Mount Abu, where I studied langur monkeys intermittently between 1971 and 1979,
repeated male invasions accompanied by infanticide occurred in one unusually small troop.
Because so few infants were allowed to grow up, this troop grew smaller still-so small that
males who usurped it were soon tempted to try to take over the larger troop next door as well,
attempting to control both troops at once, and in the process made the small troop especially vul­
nerable to yet another takem·cr (Hrdy 1977 ). Chronically vulnerable to a new male coming in and
attacking the infants, the group still existed when our observations ended in 1 979, but it seemed
to be on its way to oblivion. The neighboring group was expanding at its expense. Infanticidal
behavior was on average advantageous to individual males, but quite detrimental to this group.

male and take over his troop. Rather, by attacking a young mother and killing her infant, the
killer essentially demonstrates that the mother's current mate is unable to protect her offspring.
She subsequently d ecamps and follows the killer.

argue that the unusually high rates of infanticide among savanna baboons in Botswana can in part
be attributed to the lact that there is often only one resident male doing most of the breeding.

the other, and practically impossible to measure how investment in one offspring detracts from
the ability to invest in another. For this reason, anyone planning research in this area should con­
sult Clutton-Brock 1991, which d{,als at length with these problems. Nevertheless, one of the

24. The consortium of biologists working with Gowaty on the "free female choice project" is
funded by a$ 36o,ooo grant from the National Science Foundation, an unusually large grant in
the field of animal behavior and testimony to how important research on female choice­
including research inspired by Gowaty's explicitly feminist ideas-has become. Their goal is to
evaluate the criteria used by females to choose mates in a range of insects, rodents, fish, and
birds. Through examining female preferences and their biological consequences they hope to
answer questions such as: Does female mate choice matter for "outbred vigor"? For "good
genes"? Are there detectable differences in the viability of offspring depending on whether or not
females have more freedom to select which males they mate with? The suspicion of nineteenth­
century feminists like Eliot and Charlotte Perkins Gilman that breeding systems constrained by
males are not only dystopic but dysgenic is now for the first time being subjected to scientific
inquiry. As Gowaty points out, it would have saved a lot of time and misguided effort if we had
asked such questions earlier. But the important thing is, we are asking them now.

est birth ever recorded for a wild gorilla female was also documented for a female who managed
to remain in her natal area (Harcourt, Stewart, and Fossey 1981 :267). The moral is clear: if you
are female and can pull it off, philopatry pays. According to Wallis (1997) Fifi had successive sur­
viving births just 3. 26 years apart, compared to the more usual five- to eight-year intervals char­
acteristic of wild Great Apes. No unprovisioncd wild chimps had been known to breed that fast.
38. Quote from Hrdy 1981: 109. See Sherman 1981 and Digby 1994 for case studies; sec Digby,
Merrill, and Davis (in prep.) for general review. At the time of the first reports of infanticide and
cannibalism by female chimps, Goodall (1977) was convinced that the killer was deranged.
However, what struck a sociobiologist examining patterns of infanticide across a wide array of
animal species was how similar the general outlines of the chimp cases were to patterns of infan­
ticide in other animals (Hrdy 1981a: 1o8-9). By 1997, however, even Goodall and her colleagues
                              NOTES      TO     PAGES        _5"2-60
were convinced that infanticide by chimp females was "a significant if sporadic threat, rather than
the pathological behavior of one female" (Pusey, Williams, and Goodall 1997:830 ), which I take
to be the latest word on the subject.
39· Blackwell 18 75:2 2.
40. Women fieldworkers, especially primatologists, would play key roles in ar ticulating the spe­
cial problems confronted by females. See Fedigan 1982; Haraway 1989; Strum and Fedigan
 1996; Norbeck et al. 1997. Within science, coverage of these issues has been broad and bal­
anced, if belated (e.g., see Morell 199p).
     Biases in primatology may have been more blatant, but were scarcely confined to this one
taxon. Why, then, were women primatologists more sensitized to the problem of bias? Many of
them came from backgrounds in the social sciences, and hence were more exposed, and exposed
earlier, to seepage from feminist writings. But there is another reason. The more nearly animals
resemble ourselves, the more difficult it becomes to replace preconceptions about females with
empirically derived observations, but also, I suspect, the greater will be the likelihood that
researchers identify with the interests of members of their same sex (Smuts 1985"; Hrdy 1986a).
Recently Holmes and Hitchcock ( 1997) surveyed the topics that animal behaviorists choose to
study. Their findings lend support to this generalization. In general, women behaviorists arc no
more likely than men to study topics related to females or young animals, although women, it
turns out, are more likely to study mammals than they are to study insects or fish. Among prima­
tologists, however, women arc significantly more likely to study females, men to study males.
     Symposia proceedings and other publications marking inclusion of female perspectives in
evolutionary biology generally include Lancaster 1973; Wasser 1983; Small 1984; Rosenqvist
and Buglund 1992; Gowaty 1997. For overview see Batten 1992; Licsen I995", I997; Rosser

41. Eberhard I 990:26 3, 1996. Some biologists have queried whether this new "female perspec­
tive" was "a female or a scientific triumph" (Cunningham and Birkhead I997). The question
seems almost mischievous. Obviously, benefits from correcting long-standing biases accrue to
science. If the question is rephrased, however, to ask if women researchers played disproportion­
ate roles in attempting to correct the biases, a hundred and fifty years of largely unwritten his­
tory indicates that the answer is yes.

diploid reproduction (the way humans do it), in haplodiploid organisms all genes that sisters
derive from their father are the same. Normally (under diploidy) the average degree of related­
ness between full siblings is one-half (they have a one-quarter chance of receiving the same genes
from their mother plus another one-quarter chance of receiving the same genes from their
father). PrO\·ided the queen mates only with one male, the average degree of relatedness
between full sisters in a haplodiploid system is three-quarters, since the half of their genes
receh·ed from their fathers is always identical. However, queens mate with one male less often
than initially supposed.

 I4. Hamilton I963, I964. Darwin himself had arrived at the same logical explanation for the
devotion of sterile workers but without knowing about genes was unable to work out the prob­
lem as Hamilton did. Instead, Darwin relied on a common analogy. He compared the distinctive
attributes of individuals belonging to a sterile caste to "a well flavoured vegetable" that, even
though destroyed when it is eaten before going to seed, has nevertheless induced "the horticul­
turalist [to sow) seeds of the same stock" so as "to get nearly the same variety" (cited in Holl­
dobler and Wilson I994:97). Technically, Hamilton's rule is expressed asK> Yr but the form I
use here is the one preferred by those teaching Hamilton's rule to students, as it is easier to
understand.

Judge I 993). Even when people leave wealth to spouses rather than blood kin, which was not
always the case but has become the rule in the United States over the past I so years, wives avoid
lea,·ing wealth to husbands presumably because a widower may marry again and divert wealth to
other offspring, while widowers, who need worry less about reproduction (by mostly post­
menopausal wives) do not bias against spouses (Judge and Hrdy I 992). For evidence of nepotism

females did. A successful male fruit fly could thus produce nearly three times as many off �pring
as the most successful female. From these results, Bateman extrapolated to humans. He stressed
that the difference between the most successful and the least successful male, what today is
known as the variance in reproductive success, was always greater than the variance in female
reproductive success . Bateman's observation became central to sexual selection theory after it

was picked up by Robert Trivcrs (I972 ), who elaborated and refined it by incorporating the con­
cept of parental investment.T he basic observation was correct, hut old paradigms left over from
the nineteenth century shaped the way these results were interpreted, and ovcrintcrprctcd, to
mean that selection operates more powerfully on males than females. In fact, what Bateman's
experiments showed was that in fruit flies traits that helped in mate competition were more
important for males than females.

 1 S· Bruce I 960. Even after biologists realized that infanticide was probably implicated in the
Bruce effect, the first explanation invoked selection on males to somehow cause females to reab­
sorb the fetus (Wilson I 975: 1 H)· In fact, it must be the case that selection operated onfemales to
reabsorb their own fetuses. Although losing her fetus would never be advantageous, it would be
less disadvantageous than continuing to invest in a doomed litter. Since at that point her best
option is to conceive again, the mother's and the infanticidal male's interests suddenly coin­
cide-a subtle distinction, of interest primarily to those tracing changes in the way evolutionary
theory was applied to the two sexes (Labov et al. I 985"). Some of the best work on this topic has
been done with voles, which have a somewhat different breeding system from mice, and a differ­
ent form of male-induced pregnancy disruption that apparently continues to operate later into
the pregnancy than is the case in mice (Storey 1990).

survival of young to weaning constitutes 46-64 percent of the total variance in lifetime repro­

would have known a bit about, whose offspring arc born as far apart as five years? Or were Pleis­
tocene foragers breeding at more nearly two- to three-year intervals, as some forest foragers
with more meat in their diet routinely do? Did plant foods gathered by women provide the staple
food, or was meat more important? When people relied upon shellfish and other aquatic food, or
hunted with nets, were both sexes participating? Answers to such questions have implications for
how dependent on men mothers were for food to feed their children, and would have influenced
whether women always lived among their husband's kin or spent more time among their own
matrilineal kin. How much did fathers do to provide and help care for offspring? W ho else
helped? Answers depend not only on which hunter-gatherer society in what part of the world,
but also on demographic features of the group such as which individuals were on hand to help,

11. For concise o\·en·iew of this literature see Foley 1996. Paleontologists like Robert Foley
along with behavioral ecologists like Kaplan and Hill and cultural anthropologists like William
Irons have been at the forefront of those shifting the focus away from the Environment of Evolu­
tionary Adaptedness (EEA) to "decision rules" humans and other primates use to cope in differ­
ent emironments. Irons first proposed replacing the EEA with the phrase "Environment of
Evolutionary Relevance" (Irons 1998 ).
 11. A mother who remains near her kin in "matrilocal" arrangements retains more autonomy
than if she travels a long distance from her natal place to breed and lives among strangers, a gen­
eralization that applies across all well-studied species of primate, as well as human societies
where one or the other sex customarily leaves their natal place at marriage. See Schelegel 1972;

17. Guppies provide one of the best examples of rapid evolution. These brightly colored fresh­
water fish can be found in rivers on the island of Trinidad, where they are preyed upon by vora­
cious cichlids. In response to this heavy predation pressure, Trinidadian guppies evolved so as to
live life in the fast lane, maturing as fast as possible so as to reproduce before being eaten. Fur­
ther upstream, however, a series of waterfalls prevented both guppies and their predators from
penetrating upland streams. W hen experimenters released guppies in these low-predation habi­
tats, there was a rapid transformation . In less than eleven years, after fewer than eighteen gener­
ations of breeding under reduced predation pressure, the guppies evolved a completely different
"life history."They grew bigger, bred later, and lived longer. Mothers' slower reproductive pace
was matched by higher infant survival.
      When captured and bred in the lab, the slower-breeding guppies pass on their slow-
                           NOTES         TO     PAGES 106-117
maturing life-history schedules to progeny who, like their parents, also grow bigger, breed later,
and produce smaller litters containing larger individuals. Faster-breeding guppies from the pre­
dated stock downstream, however, continue to breed at their same rapid pace.Thus, differences
between the two stocks involved genetic changes in the wild populations from which these spec­
imens had been taken. See Resnick et al. 1997; Rice 1996; Holland and Rice 1999 for additional
examples; for overview of recent studies, sec Svensson 1997. For similar examples in life­

extraordinary sense of calmness being extolled here. They are not abnormal, simply anxious, a
state that may make breast-feeding harder to establish and maintain due to failure of the let­
down reflex. Since milk was not spurting out, the baby sucked harder, producing sore or cracked
nipples. In such cases, exogenous oxytocin (administered in a spray) may help, although not so
much as just relaxing. This book is not intended as a how-to guide, but today there arc awfully

 18. The most famous example of socially deprived mothers who learned to improve is provided
by the rehabilitation of Harry Harlow's infamous "motherless mothers" (Suomi and Harlow
1972). Apes born in zoos also sometimes fail to care for firstborns. W hen zookeepers then have
to remove and rear these babies by hand, the problem may be perpetuated. Some zoos now actu­
ally ha,·c remedial "mothering" programs: future gorilla mothers are given dolls to play with!
Scientifically, however, such programs arc hard to evaluate, since some mothers may improve
with age as a matter of course.

20. Higher mortality rates for firstborn infants arc widely docu­
mented for both capth·e and wild primates (Harley 1990; Drick­
amer 1974; Silk ct al. 1981). The failure rate for wild howler
monkeys is probably the highest on record; in some small sam­
ples, none of the firstborn infants survh-c (Glander 1980).
      The same J-shaped pattern (i.e., mortality highest among
infants born to very young and older mothers) is typical of
human populations (Srh·asta,·a and Sakscna 1981; World Health Organization 1976). Some of
this increased mortality is probably due to the physical limitations of a very young mother, as
well as inexperience.

27. "Kidnaping" resulting in starvation of the infant has been reported for various species of cer­
copithecine monkeys (rhesus and Japanese macaques, baboons, and guenons). Reports are very
rare, but it is also rare for mothers in these species to permit another female to take her new
infant. When I first identified the phenomenon, Ed Wilson had not yet coined the term allo­
mother, so I referred to it as "aunting to death"; see section on "Incompetence, kidnapping and
aunting to death" in Hrdy 1976: 12)-28. For modern reviews of"allomaternal abuse" and kid­
naping see Silk 1980 and the up-to-date overview of allomaternal care and abuse of infants by

28. The "freedom to forage hypothesis" was first proposed in Hrdy 197 6. Subsequently Whitten
1983 showed that wild vervet monkey mothers do obtain feeding benefits from turning over
their baby to a group mate. See also Fairbanks 1990 for captive vervets; Stanford 1992 for wild
capped langurs.ln 1997 Mitani and Watts published a comparative analysis across primates show­
ing that allomaternal care is correlated with faster infant growth and more rapid reproduction.

30. Although what looks like hormonal "priming" for motherhood occurs among pregnant
monkeys, both in captivity and in the wild, I ha,·e been unable to locate any endocrinological
research for primates providing definitive evidence that hormones are responsible in the same
way that Terkel and Rosenblatt were able to show for rats. For data on wild langurs see Hrdy

31. Hrdy '977:214-27. Long ago I wondered if the mother's milk in infant-sharing species
might not be richer than the dilute milk typical of most primates. But when, thanks to Dr. Jill
Mellen at the Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Oregon, I was finally able to get samples of milk
from hanuman langurs and black and white colobus monkeys, Bo Lonnerdahl of the Department
of Nutrition at the University of California, Davis, found that their milk was not significantly
higher in protein and lipids than rhesus monkeys' milk-a species with no infant-sharing.

4•    As always, there are a handful of exceptions, species of primates where other group mem­
bers continue, like humans, to provision immatures after weaning. Tamarin dads, for example,
provide wcanlings the occasional grasshopper, while bonoho allomothers may also provide food
to the offspring of a female they are friendly with. A common chimpanzee mother may allow off­
spring as old as eight years of age to cadge an occasional termite or nut meat . Much of the "shar­
ing" occurs while youngsters fumble alongside their mothers, beginning to master the art of
poking stripped twigs into termite holes to fish lor them, or cracking open hard-shelled nuts.
None of this, however, is provisioning on the same scale human children require.

9· Ne•·er is a risky word to usc about behavior. But in y ears of doing research in this area, I have
not heard or read of any exceptions apart from those found among captive primates. It is wdl
known that monkey mothers deprived of opportunities to develop socially, or to learn to
mother, can be abusive to their infants. For some of the most extreme cases sec Harlow ct al.
 1966. A well-studied but poorly understood case of abuse hy a wild-born but now captive Japa­
nese macaque mother at the Rome Zoo comes closest to being an exception. T he lethally abusive
treatment of her infants hy this macaque mother has bc<>n described (Troisi et al. 1982). A sam-
                            NOTES        TO    PAGES       I 79-1 8)
pie of"abusive" mothers has been identified at theYerkes Primate Center in Atlanta (Maestripieri
1998). However, these rhesus macaque mothers-mostly low-ranking or of unusually anxious
temperaments-seem more nearly overly restrictive and controlling than murderous. Dearth of
reports of abusive mothers in the wild could mean either that abuse does not occur, or that the
abused infant dies before observers have an opportunity to document it. Given the hundreds of
thousands of hours that primates have been studied in the wild, however, the latter is unlikely.
 10.  For maternal preference for her own over a borrowed infant see Hrdy 1977 (chap. 7). For
quantitative evidence on "cost" of being a twin and maternal preference for own over adoptive
infant twin, see Ellsworth and Andersen 1997. Anecdotal cases involving twins are relevant but
difficult to interpret, for example the abandonment of the sicker of two twin daughters born to a
wild gorilla mother (Watts and Hess 1988).
 11. Endangered in the wild, Saauinus oedipus breeds well in captivity. The following data are for
65"9 infants born over two decades at the New England Primate Center. For some pairs, one or
both parents already had caretaking experience. For them, what mattered most was the availabil­
ity of help. Of 6s liveborn young who had older siblings present to help rear them, only 1 2. 3
percent were rejected. But if no older siblings were present, S7 ·4 percent of 148 liveborns were
rejected (Johnson, Petto, and Sehgal 1991). Abandoned marmoset and tamarin infants have also
been observed in the wild, but no rates are available (personal communication from Leslie
Digby).
12. I am not counting the benign, and nearly universal, maternal practice of threatening--or
scolding-an older sibling when a younger one squeals, or when an older, weaned juvenile
attempts to displace its infant sibling on the nipples.
 •3· In the langur case, the attacker was known to be the mother's new consort; in the gorilla
case, the researcher David Watts suspected that he was. Watts has observed eight cases where
young gorillas (aged 2.8 to 4 years) were left behind when their mothers transferred to groups
containing new males. In almost all cases, the young gorilla attached himself to a brother or a
former consort of its mother (Watts 1 989; also "Karisoke orphans," n.d., courtesy of D. Watts).
See Moore 1 98) for additional accounts of mothers leaving nearly weaned offspring with all­
male bands. For prepubescent female soliciting male see Hrdy 1977: 269-71, 27 8.

with poor employment or marriage prospects. Among other things, these teenage mothers are
more likely to ha\'c mothers and grandmothers still alive to help them.
U• Since ven·ets are infant-sharing monkeys, even first-time mothers would have had opportu­
nities to practice mothering prior to birth, whether they gave birth early or at an age more usual
for wild ven·ets (Fairbanks199 ); Fairbanks and McGuire 199)).

39· According to Murdock ( 1967), 71 percent of cultures worldwide are patrilocal---so the
wife leaves her natal place to live with husband's kin. Among contemporary foraging societies
living more nearly as our Pleistocene ancestors would have, however, roughly half (.�6 percent)
li\·ed in patrilocal groups; most others are matrilocal or bilocal-moving opportunistically
between his kin and hers (Ember 1978). This statistic is obtained by deleting hunting and gather­

4·    A lovely example would be the enormous silvcrback gorilla male who sleeps nestled next to
an adopted infant, the only other gorilla ever allowed to share his sleeping nest (Stewart 1981).
Da,·id Watts records eight cases when gorillas aged 2. 8 to 4 years were left behind when their
mothers transferred to other groups. Almost all "orphans" were able to attach to an older brother
or to a former consort of the mother (Watts 1989 and n.d.).
S·    Absence of a fos-B gene, for example, has the same obliterating effect on male retrieval of
young that it has on the mother's. This suggests that the wiring for parental care (in this case,
retrieval) is similar in both sexes (Brown ct al. 1996).

 1 o. There is a rich literature on these "special friendships": sec Ransom and Rowell 1972; Strum
1987; and Smuts I 98�.       Smuts added an extra twist to the baboon story. She proposed that,
sometimes, male baboons forged "special friendships" with females and looked out for infants,
not because her infant might he his, but because his intimate relationship with the mother
improves a male's chances of mating when the mother weans her infant and hccomcs fertile
again.
 I I. The savanna baboons at Morcmi arc "Chacma haboons" (Papio ursinus). But the differences
between these baboon populations and those studied in Kenya arc probably due as much to the
different habitats as to these "strain" differences (Palombit, Seyfarth, and Cheney 1997 ) . As with
langur monkeys, or house mice, the amount of intraspecific variation is enormous. The tcrminol-
 s-66                     NOTES         TO      PAGES 215-22s-
ogy and basic concepts in animal behavior arc really not well suited to describe it. It is our failure
to have recognized the extent of intraspecific variation in "weedy" and highly adaptable species
like these that led anthropologists for so long to imagine that intraspecific variation was uniquely
human. It is not.

 I4• Alexander Harcourt et al. (198 1) plotted average testes size for all primate species for
 which they could obtain the information on one axis, and number of breeding males per female
on the other axis; the resulting correlation allowed them to reliably distinguish primates with
one-male breeding systems (like monogamous titi monkeys or harem-dwelling gorillas) from
those most often found in multimalc ones, like chimps or savanna baboons, where a number of
adult males reside permanently in the troop and a female in estrus mates with many or all of
them within a period of a few days. Even the seeming outliers turned out to be more nearly
exceptions that confirm the rule. Tamarins, for example, had testes way too big for their tradi­
tional designation as monogamous primates. T hen new field studies revealed that tamarin
females in fact breed with multiple males-- who all thereafter help care for offspring. For mam­

16. The anthropologistWilliam Irons has argued that when men pursue culturally defined goals,
what has been selected for is not specific behaviors but a general desire to strive for recognition,
prestige, control, and well-being within the social context that the individual grew up in, among
people who share the same values (Irons 1979: 2)8).
17. This famous study, titled "International preferences in selecting mates: A study of 37 cul­
tures" (Buss et al. 1990), is cited by evolutionary psychologists as evidence that women univer­
sally value men's earning capacity more than men value women's, and that women ha\'e an
innate, species-typical capacity to seek men with resources. Since most of the data came from
interviews with university students in countries or cultures where a wife's well-being and status
depends on her husband's earning capacity, the result is scarcely surprising. Nevertheless, finan­
cial prospects consistently ranked below measures of reliability. For any reader who has trouble
locating the published study, Boyd and Silk ( 1997 :6H -4-7) provide a summary and reanalysis.

24. Scheper-Hughes 1 99 2; Schuster 1979; Guyer 1994. Some experts on African family life
ha,·c proposed an alternative explanation based on cultural diffusion. They view mother-headed
households and reliance on kin networks to help rear children as"signs of an African heritage"
(e.g., Miller 1998). Olwiously if unpredictability of resources provided by fathers also pertains
in the West African cases, these two explanations arc not mutually exclusive. Also, cultural diffu­
sion offers little help explaining why people with the same cultural background set up nuclear
families when husbands get better jobs. Unquestionably, the unpredictability of resources pro­
,·ided by fathers is a factor. Sec lisa M. Glazer Schuster's New Women 4Lusaka ( 1979). This is part

and Parker 199s-a, 199s-b; Gowaty 1996, 1997; Hrdy 1997). But there are also human popula­

are there genetic consequences for men? For women?We have not the slightest idea.

Hence, like primates, female lions may have evolved polyandrous mating with multiple males to
confuse paternity and discourage infanticidal impulses.

Packer, Tatar, and Collins 1998). Some argue that reproductive changes in other primates are
more idiosyncratic than among humans, but I am far more struck by the similarities between
humans and chimps. Not all wild chimps reach menopause before they die, but they would if
they lived long enough. Menopause in women, although guaranteed to happen, is also not invari­
ant in time of onset. For example, in a large sample of American nurses not taking hormone
replacements, 8 percent still occasionally menstruate at age fifty-five (Alice Rossi, personal com­
munication,August 4, 1997).

1 S· Reviewed in Sherman 1998; Nessc and Williams 1994. Another \'ersion of the "stopping
early" or "grandmother hypothesis" proposed that menopause itself evolved so that old females
would be free to help their kin. So far it has received little support. Based on work by Kim
Hill, Alan Rogers, and Magdalena Hurtado, most researchers in this area have been dissuaded
from continuing to argue that inclusive benefits to grandmothers from helping kin might be
sufficient to cause females to cease to produce offspring themselves in order to devote them­
selves to offspring of others. T hat is, women may be doing this, but this is probably not why
menopause evolved. For the fi r st attempt to test this idea empirically, see Hill and Hurtado

21. Note that this as yet unsupported hypothesis is distinct from the still viable, if unproven,
hypothesis whereby a prudent mother, confronted with inevitable senescence of her ovaries, is
selected to stop cycling early in order to increase her chances of pulling her infant through.
Unfortunately, though, these two quite different propositions both get referred to in the popular
literature as "the grandmother hypothesis." The muddle is aggravated by the fact that still a third
proposition is also referred to under the catchall phrase. This third version is not being used to
explain menopause per sc, but to explain why females in species such as humans go on living so
long after menopause.
      Hence, in a recent news account, zoologist Craig Packer was widely quoted to the effect
that "menopause isn't adaptive. It has no function" (sec, for example, Gibbons 1998b). Packer's
data on baboons and lions suggested that females did not stop reproducing early to help others'
infants. However, the same data arc consistent with the"prudent mother stopping early" version
of the "grandmother hypothesis." Readers were left to figure out for themselves which of the
three possible versions of the "grandmother hypothesis" had been debunked: ( 1) stopping early
to help own offspring as well as grandchildren; ( 2) stopping early to help offspring of others; or
( 3) given that menopause is inevitable, females live on afterward to help kin. (It was only"grand­
mothcr hypothesis" number two that Packer's data excluded.) Readers seeking clarification
should sec Sherman 1 998.
22. judge and Carey ( 1998) analyzed available data for female body weights, brain weights, and
lifespan across thirty-five anthropoid genera in order to construct a regression that would allow
them to project what the lifespan of Homo sapiens should be. The number they came up with, 72
years, was substantially longer than the p-)6 years estimated for Homo habilis or the 6o-63
years for Homo erectus (Hammer and Foley 1996). The cebus monkey is the only other primate
with a lifespan quite so off-scale. Interestingly, lactating female cebus monkeys routinely allow
other females' infants to suckle, suggesting that there may be a valuable service older kin can
provide (Perry 1996; sec discussion below, in chapter 13).

Jones 19S9 and 1997. Older kinswomen's hdp in provisioning mothers could explain the ten­
dency toward matrilocality in societies where gathering is espt'cially important. It might also
explain a tcndency for women to rem.lin ncar thdr own kin ll'hcrc huntin9 is important. So surpris­
ing was this corrdation to anthropologists, who had long assumed that hunting must be corre­
latcd with male philopatry and bands of males sticking together as "men in groups," the first
response was to discount correlations bctwt'en subsistence and residence patterns as not mean­
ingful. Hence in a recent re\·icw of residence patterns among hunter-gatherers, Witkowski and
Dh·ale write: "When hunting is especially important ...this primarily male activity docs not
lead to patrilocality as expected; instead there is actually a weak tendency toward matrilocality.
This suggests that the modest association between subsistence contribution and unilocal resi­
dence in food collecting societies is not a meaningful one" ( 1996:674).
      But there is another possibility, namely that correlations between subsistence and residence
patterns arc indeed meaningful, but that they tell anthropologists something they had not
expected: that whenever they can, women remain ncar their female relatives because in foraging
societies a mother's mother and sisters arc more reliable allomothcrs than the father and his
kin are. The fact that in non-hunter-gatherer, post-Neolithic societies patrilocal residence has
become the rule (not counting large-scale modern societies in which people do not necessarily
reside near kin) may reflect the fact that women started to have less say over where they lived.

used to distinguish "the killing of an unwanted neonate within the first few hours of life" from
"lilicide" (the killing of child after its role in the family is more firmly established) because the

than the former (Resnick 1970; d'Orban 1979). In the United States being born to a mother

2.    Visaria (1967) reported sex ratios in Korea as high as 116 boys per 1 oo girls, leading some
to conclude that Koreans may be genetically predisposed to produce sons. This interpretation
received tentative support when Morton, Chung, and Mi (1967) reported higher than average
sex ratios among Hawaiian children whose fathers were of Korean descent. Subsequently, Park
( 1 98 3) proposed that these sex ratios were the outcome of parental decisions to continue giving
birth after daughters arc born, stopping with sons. Mathematically, however, the probability of
producing a son or a daughter at each birth should remain the same. Hence, others argued that
instead of"stopping rules," parents were somehow actively intervening through selective termi­
nation of female fetuses. There the matter stands - -unresolved.
 J•   Although officially forbidden for usc in sex-selective abortion, prenatal sex determination is
widdy available in China. Ultrasound imaging is the most common technique, but amniocentesis
permits parents to k·arn the sex by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. Results from analyzing pla­

(CVS), was pionec1·cd in China, and became available there long before it was in the West.

21. Medical doctors and geneticists in the West are divided over the morality of prenatal sex
diagnosis,though some resistance lessened with the introduction of amniocentesis, which per­
mits sex determination in the first 2o weeks of pregnancy (Kolata 198 8). Even so,many doctors
in countries such as Britain and the U.S. are unwilling to perform prenatal sex determinations if
they suspect parents are using the test to select one or the other sex. But it is not illegal (Perera
1987).

umented by Ann Clark ( 1978) for galagos. Researchers studying wild dogs proposed a similar
model,which they expanded to include behaviors by sons or daughters that augment the value of
local resources (Frame,Malcolm, and Frame 1979). In 1 98�, Gowaty and Lennartz proposed
the term "local resource enhancement" and provided the model used by behavioral ecologists

42. Altmann, Hausfater, and Altmann I988. At roughly the same time that the Amboseli results
on sex ratios began to emerge, Silk (I983, I988) was finding almost identical patterns among
captive bonnet macaques. T hese studies arc important because females in the best condition
overproduce daughters. Since males tend to be the more vulnerable sex, the fact that deer, pos­
sum, and coypu mothers in good condition tend to overproduce sons could he attributed to the
fact that sons die off at higher rates when mothers arc stressed. Clearly, though, this would not
explain cases where mothers in the worst condition produce the highest proportion of sons.
43· Tactics used by high-ranking females to harass low-ranking ones range from knocking babies
off nipples to forcibly taking them from their mothers and refusing to give them back to nurse­
in effect, kidnaping them. Montserrat Gomendio (I990) attributes longer birth intervals after
the birth of a daughter among captive rhesus macaques to such interference. Because higher­
ranking females targeted mothers with daughters, their babies were knocked off the nipple. To
get fed, they had to reattach, stimulating nipples in the process and causing prolactin levels to
rise. Gomendio hypothesized that this is why low-ranking mothers who bear daughters take
longer to resume ovulating and conceive again than do low-ranking mothers of sons. For
extreme interference leading to the infant's death from starvation, sec Silk ct al. I 98 I.

14. Mothers in cooperatively breeding mammals like mice or lions may combine and commu-
nally suckle their litters. But among primates, such shared nursing is only found among littcr­
bt'aring, ncsting prosimians - never in simian, or "higher," pri mates. Such allomatcrnal suckling
as can hl' found in monkeys has been most often studied in C<'bus monkeys. Sine<' moth<'rs among
these South American m onk<'ys don't wean infants until long into their next pregnancy, they arc
almost perpetually lactating. Typically, older, already mobile infants who find thcmsclv<'s tem­
porarily separated from their moth<'rs demand milk from their moth<'r's relatives- especially
new mothers who arc subordinate to them (O'Brien and Robinson 1991; Perry 1996). As pri­
m atologist Susan Perry points out,it's energy-consuming to refuse. Costs to the lactating female
arc small compared to benefits for a youngster temporarily separated from its moth<'r.

H• Assuming that the nurse in the home cost 18-20 fiori annually, compared with 8-1 5 for a
nurse in the country,parents are paying more for sons. The longer stint with wet nurses for those
sons sent out often came in the form of a "bonus" period that allowed th e infant a more leisurely
transition to weaning. Of 28 3 privileged Florentine children sent out of the house to wet nurses,
82 percent of the boys and 84 pe rcent of the girls survived. It is assumed that the sons kept at
home to be nursed did even better. Did the extra payments made for those sons who were sent

40. The most plausible explanation for decreased family sizes among elites was "status anxiety"
as proposed by demographer Sheila Johannson ( 1987). But there must have been other factors,
not yet understood. Some kind of "demographic transition" becomes apparent in Europe
between IJSO and 18so and starts to reduce completed family sizes by the beginning of the
twentieth century. Human behavioral ecologists show that people mluntarily reduce family sizes
as they opt for economic well-being over producing large numbers of offspring. See especially

H· Based on intrr\'iew data rrported in lsiugo-Abanihc 198), one out of three Ghanian women
and 40 percent of Liberian women between the ages of fifteen and thirty had a child living in
another household. Forty-six percent of Sierra Lconean women aged thirty to thirty-four had
fostered children out. See Page 1989 (table 9.1) for Cameroon, Lesotho, and Ivory C oast; Bled­
soe and lsiugo-Abanihe 1989 for general discussion. Slightly lower levels of fostering can he doc­
umented for Kenya, Nigeria, and Sudan (Goody 1984; Silk 1987b). Significantly higher survival
rates for children with maternal grandmothers were calculated by Mace and Sear (1999) using
data collected in rural Gambia between 1 949 and 197).
56. One significant outcome is that the availability of fostering reduces incentives for parents to
seek reliable methods for birth control (Bledsoe 1990 ). Among Herrero pastoralists in South
Africa, )o percent of all children born to unmarried mothers were fostered out, compared with
32 percent of those born to married parents. Often too, a mother will divest herself of children
by fostering them out before going to a new husband. This may be why unmarried women under
twenty were far more likely to foster out children than were older women (Pennington 1991:
table 6). Most commonly, mothers send children to live with their own mothers (Rene Penning­
ton, personal communication, April 29, 1998). For similar patterns in West Africa, sec Isiugo­
Abanihe 198).
H· Researchers from the Department of Social Medicine at the Federal University of Pelotas,

thing on the maternal front might have been missing in his own upbringing. I find Karen's expla­
nation plausible, yet I wonder if Karen, a psychoanalyst himself, underestimated just how large
Darwin loomed for Bowlby for purely intellectual reasons, as argued by Darwin scholar Frank

9· The term "hyperventilation syndrome" was still considered a valid diagnosis at the time
Bowlby invoked it in 1990, but is now passing out of medical usage (see Hornsveld et al. 1996).
Nevertheless, the hypothesis that Darwin suffered from some sort of anxiety disorder (what is
known today as "panic disorder") which among other things allected his breathing, remains plau­
sible (Barloon and Noyes 1997 ).

16. Dates mentioned here are dcliberatcly vague, because although I know human birth inter­
vals would have grown shorter, I don't know when, or whether the changes were gradual or even
always in the same direction. Just as a wild guess, we can posit that by a million or two years ago
Homo erectus mothers were too hairless for babies to cling to. The improved efficiency with which
Homo erectus parents and their helpers were extracting calories from their environment (dis­
cussed pp. 28�--86) would already mean shorter birth intervals. But the real prelude to the
Neolithic probably did not begin until around �o,ooo years ago, when paleoarcheologists who
study stone technologies and cave art hypothesize that something cognitive and important
changed in Homo sapiens (sec Klein 1992).

included the ongoing debate concerning whether selection operated at the level of the group­
as argued byV. C. Wynne-Edwards ( 19 �9. 1962)          -or at the level of the individual, as argued by
Hinde's dose colleague David Lack (1966). A key reason for Bowlby's ideas having stood the test
of time so well was that all of his arguments about attachment arc phrased in terms of survival
value to the individual infant, rather than (as most social scientists would ha,·e done at that time)
being phrased in terms of benefits to the group or family into which the infant was horn.

1 o. For discussion see the chapter on "Metaphors into Hardware: Harry Harlow and the Tech­
nology of Love" in Haraway 1989. Because Harlow's "motherless" infants grew up to be sexually
inept adults, for reproduction to occur, the experimenters "resorted to an apparatus affection­
ately termed the rape rack which we leave to the reader's imagination" (cited in Haraway
1989:2 38). Re,·iewing this painful history, Haraway concluded: "Misogyny is deeply implicated
in the dream structure of laboratory culture; misogyny is built into the objects of everyday life in
laboratory practice, including the bodies of the animals, the jokes in the publications, ancl the
shape of the equipment" (1989:2 38).
 1 1.  Bowlby saw in the use of nonhuman subjects a way to do controlled experiments unthink­
able with human infants. Likewise, for many of us, experiments on maternal deprivation are now
unthinkable for monkeys as well since the case for simian despair has been so conclusively
demonstrated; Robert Hinde 1996, and interviews with Hinde, June 14--24, 1996.

Robertson's famous 19n film. See esp. Hinde and McGinnis 1977. Even in "infant-sharing"
species such as langur monkeys, cold-turkey separation from the mother (with no other female
holding the infant) is extremely stressful. All langur babies complain when separated from their
mothers. But when experimenters working with a colony of langur monkey s at Berkeley actually
removed mothers from the group, some, but not all, infants managed to attach themselves to
foster mothers; those that did not, died (Dolhinow 1 980).

 •5· All monkey and ape infants are distressed when deprived of physical contact with a care­
taker. Only among the prosimian primates are there some cases (like Varecia) where mothers
leave their infants in nests. Almost invariably, monkey, ape, and human infants complain when
they are first separated from their mothers. Nevertheless, there is considerable intraspecific as
well as interspecific variation in the willingness of a mother to allow other individuals (so-called
allomothers) to hold and carry her infant, as well as interspecific variation in the tolerance of
infants for strange caretakers. Scientists arc just beginning to study the sources of these inter­
individual differences in temperament. Sec Suomi 1999 for monkeys; and for human babies,

 18. Spencer-Booth and Hinde ( 1971 b) noted that: "The intensely 'clinging' behaviour shown by
the rhesus infants in the immediately post-separation period is also characteristic of many human
children, though some of the latter after severe separations show instead 'detachment' and a dif­
ficulty re-establishing affectional relations which we did not see in these monkeys" ( 1971b: 19 1).
They were struck by the absence of such avoidant responses among macaques.To this day, I know
of no published report of an avoidant response for nonhuman primates.

3·    As discussed in chapter 11, wild apes breed even more slowly than humans do. At the
extreme end of ape birth intervals, common chimpanzees in the Kibale Forest of Uganda space
births up to eight years apart (personal communication from Richard Wrangham, 1997). Dct­
twyler (199 s) hypothesizes that some humans in prehistory suckled as long as seven years. What
this means for our ancestors is that ifconditions were harsh enouah they, too, would have nursed that
long.When conditions were good, two to four years (Dettwyler's norm) would have been more
like it.

5'·   Geoffrey Parker and Robert Trivcrs were primarily responsible for calling attention to the
relevance of anisogamy for understanding relative parental investment and mating systems in
animals. Recently, however, these concepts have been borrowed by social scientists with little
attention to the underlying biology. Aware that anisogamy did not constitute some hard and fast
rule about how males and females would behave, Trivcrs ( 1972) was fascinated by all the excep­
tions he could find, cases where females competed among themselves for access to males, as in
phalaropes and jicanas. Even though the jicana's egg is bigger than the male's sperm, jicana
females invest less per offspring than males do, hence the "sex reversed behavior."

22. Interview with David Haig,November 7, 1996.
23.   The Selfish Gene ( 1976) became one of the most famous of all evolutionary metaphors.
Trivers wrote the preface for Dawkins's book.By the time Haig arrived at Oxford,W. D.Hamil­
ton had joined Dawkins-making it a mecca for gene-centered interpretations.
24. By "parliament of genes," Leigh ( 1971) meant genes sometimes pulling together, sometimes
pushing apart, other times neutralizing each other's effects. By the terms of the metaphor, other
genes could band together against a gene that threatens survival of the legislative body. Sec Haig
1997= 284.
2�. Haig 1996a:2p.
26. Haig andWestoby(1 989) first proposed that embryonic genes derived from the father were
selected to extract more resources from maternal tissue than were genes of maternal origin,
while maternally imprinted genes would have been selected to counter or nullify such paternally
produced growth factors.For evidence consistent with this,see Kalscheur ct al. 199 3.

7·    How do parent birds know which chick is hungriest? Begging chicks display brightly colored
mouths, and the emptier their stomachs, the redder the display, apparently because more blood
bypasses the stomach and llows through this area. Experiments by Rebecca Kilner ( 1997) using
canaries demonstrated that parents provided more food to chicks whose mouth color was artifi­
cially reddened; for the extra testosterone in the yolk, sec Schwab! I 994·

insights. So far as skin color goes, even people with dark skin produce babies that are a lighter

graphic record is fairly consistent on this point; see, for example, Hill and Ball 1996. As Daly
and Wilson (1 988: 72-73) have pointed out, long-term parental responses to defective infants

Valenzuela's quite high-risk sample of poor mothers (p. 1992 ). Such failure of infants to thrive,
even in the presence of adequate nutrition, led Pollitt and Leibel ( 1 98o:196) to postulate that
disturbances in the relationship between mother and infant lead to "a reversible growth hormone
deficiency associated with emotional deprivation." See also Drotar I 991 .

these results linking temperament to survival by chance was seven in one hundred.

27. In China, families do not tt·aditionally celebrate a tll'W birth until the hahy is a month old, a
<'Ustom attributed to historically high infant mortality (Thurston 1 996). Among the Bcmba of
Central Africa , "the taking of the child" by the father and mother, or ukupoko mwana ceremony, is
performed at four months; this ritual also marks the postpartum point when husband and wife
can resume intercourse (Richards 1939). For Elena Valero's account, see Biocca 1971:162-63.

salt. Salt was also part of the Hebrew birth ritual and C\'entually became a token of baptism. This
is why throughout Catholic Europe salt was left with abandoned children to show that they had
been baptized (Boswell 1988:322).
36. According to an eighteenth-century Scots account, "The moment a child is born it is
plunged into cold water, though it should be necessary first to break the ice." By 1894, the Rev­
erend J. Vaux, who recorded this, docs not question his source but suggests that "This is carrying
out the principle of the sun·h·al of the fittest to rather an extreme length" (Vaux 1894:74).

 Like most p hy siologists , Girard and Ferre ( 1982: table 3) lump a great deal of diversity in pri­
mates toget her in one generic category, "the monkey." According to their measurements, one
wo   uld expect to find 2 o grams of fat per kilo of body weight in a newborn monkey weighing )OO
grams, compared with 16o grams of fat in a 3 ,)oo-gram human. Data for three ccbus infants
y ielded an average fat content of 4·) percent of carcass weight (Ausman et al. 1982). Although
Girard and Ferre put human neonatal fat mass at 16 percent of total birth weight, a subsequent
study suggests 14 percent (Ca talano et al. 1992)-still high by the standards of other mammals.

They examined how early experiences with caretakers among hunter-gatherers and African vil­

Sulloway writes,"they undergo adaptive radiation in their efforts to establish their own individual
niches within the family" (86). This is essentially polyphenism. First- and later-born offspring are
different morphs of essentially the same genotype, rather than genetically different organisms
belonging to different species. Most of the research on polyphenism focuses on identifying rele­
vant environmental cues (e.g., tannins in the diet of a caterpillar). In Sulloway, the relevant cues
are noc birth order per se, but amount of parental attention and access to parental resources. How­
ever, for a historical sample such as Sulloway's, the proxy variable "birth order" is obtainable for
large numbers of his subjects (scientists), while measures of parental preferences would not be.

T here is an old saying, "Sons branch out, but one woman leads to another." Perhaps its author was
aware of sex-specific parental effects. In any case, this book owes its existence to my mother,
Camilla Davis BlafferTrammell, and to her mother, Kate Wilson Davis, for passing on to me their
dogged temperaments (probably genetic) combined with a love of learning (more likely a mater­
nal effect). Both women were closet bluestockings, who after their respective widowhoods
metamorphosed into full-fledged scholars. Like other women of their class and time they were
determined to "marry well." How else to achieve an acceptable social status? Alternative options
in those days were not obvious. Yet these women imparted to me their love of books and ideas,
and stood up to support an iconoclastic kinswoman in her defection from tribal custom.
     For my own introduction into a world of expanding professional opportunities for women
scholars, I thank the Mayanist Evon Vogt. It was while I was his undergraduate advisee at Rad­
cliffe that I first learned how rich a field anthropology could be and also, to my amazement, that
people actually studied animals to learn more about humans. Later as a graduate student at Har­
\"ard, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work under the guidance of three pioneers in
the field of sociobiology: In·en DeYore, Robert Trivers, and Edward 0. Wilson.
     It was also during those years that I first developed a feminist consciousness. Often, I felt
like a lonely castaway throwing message bottles from a desert island as I struggled awkwardly
to become a better scholar by taking into account female as well as male perspectives. My aim
was to correct biases long implicit in evolutionary thinking without simply substituting new
biases of my own in the process. It was no easy task, yet as the years passed I was delighted to
feel the old metaphor of a castaway nudged aside, to be replaced by a more encouraging
vision. I was a woman cast upon the waves, gently uplifted by a pod of supportive dolphins­
fellow Darwinians and fellow feminists, themselves drawn forward by the currents of those
swimming ahead. My debt to these companions is very great, especially to Patricia Adair
Gowaty, Jane Lancaster, Barbara Smuts, and George Williams, who have charted new oceans

and drawn others in their wake, including those who sail along blissfully unaware of their
debt. As a result, "Darwinian feminism," as Patty Gowaty likes to say, "is an oxy moron no
longer."
     Many old friends provided information and commented on all or parts of the manuscript. I
owe large debts to Jeanne Altmann, Sue Carter, Sandy Harcourt, Robert Hinde, Dan Hrdy,
Debra Judge, David Kertzer, Jane Lancaster, Monique Borgerhoff Mulder, Peter Rodman, Jon
Seger, Frank Sulloway, Kelly Stewart, Fred vom Saal, and Mary Jane West-Eberhard. My favorite
uncle, Dietrich von Bothmer, along with other friends helped with illustrations. I thank espe­
cially Sally Landry, V irginia Savage, Dafila Scott, and Michelle Johnson for their wonderful draw­
ings, and Nancy DeVore for making available her treasure trove at Anthro-Photo.
     Two years into the writing of this book, it became apparent that I was gestating two books,
not one. Surgery was called for to separate these Siamese twins. The prospect left me paraly zed,
but Mary Batten came to my rescue. W ith a combination of talent, good sense, and good grace,
she reorganized and helped to rewrite material in Part One. Mary made many suggestions for
the book as a whole that added greatly to the coherence of the finished product. I cannot thank
her enough.
     As I struggled, I never did come up with a pat answer to the question posed in this book
about the optimal number of fathers for children born to mothers in humankind's EEA. How­
ever, I did learn that for a vast and unwieldy manuscript (at one point, twice as long as the fin­
ished project) the optimal number of editors is four. Along with Mary Batten, I am deeply
grateful to Dan Frank at Pantheon for wise counsel and for seeing me through a difficult delivery.
Savvy Jennie McDonald at Curtis Brown was unfailingly supportive and constantly reminded me
to make this book relevant to the world into which it would be born. For the final push, I was
fortunate to have the advice of Jenny Uglow of Chatto and W indus, who strove to make the book
live up to its dual citizenship.
     In addition to these book doctors, delivery of the manuscript required several midwives.
June-e) Piper was on hand from the outset. She kept track of references, located sources, and
obtained permissions for all the illustrations. It fell to a trusted friend, Gene Miner, to keep
everybody coordinated and bring order to chaos. Special thanks are due to Beth Post, Shirley
Stewart, Katherine Robinson, Jennifer Weh, and to Elizabeth Knoll at Harvard University Press
for valuable guidance early on.
     Colleagues and staff in the Department of Anthropology and in the Graduate Group in Ani­
mal Behavior at the University of California, Davis provided unfailing support. The book was
begun while I was a Guggenheim fellow. I also received support from Wenner Gren, and from
the Rockefeller Foundation Gender Roles program.
     Scholars belong to an amazing subculture. Practitioners arc socialized into a unique world­
view that accords highest priority to accuracy and shared knowledge. In addition to those whose
published works I cite, the following colleagues, some of them former teachers, fellow graduate
students from years ago, or my own former students, provided advice, drew diagrams, scolded,
and corrected. I list them by what is often just one of their specializations to acknowledge their
assistance, and again to thank each one.

"Mother Nature is a. pioneering reassessment of key assumptions in debates about
 human evolution. By demonstrating how female strategies as mates and mothers
 have shaped the evolutionary process throughout nature, Sarah Hrdy succeeds
 in overturning some of the most entrenched theories in this scientific domain.
 A worthy companion to Darwin's Descent of Man and an endlessly fascinating
 read, Mother Nature reflects a lifetime of bold research and judicious thought by
 one of the foremost primatologists of our day:'
                                        -FRANK SULLOWAY, AUTHOR OF BORN TO REBEL
"This is a brilliant, liberating book on a profoundly important subject. Sarah
 Hrdy, the l�ading scientific authority on motherhood, is also, to the benefic of
 us all, one of the best stylists now writing on any subject in science:'
                                             -E. 0. WILSON, AUTHOR OF CONSillENCE
"Sarah Hrdy has given us a truly monumental work, as elegant as it is insightful.
 It took a woman scientist to find the rightful place of our species in the matrix
 of the animal kingdom, and Hrdy has done so brilliantly. This is by no means
 the usual psychobabble or hodgepodge of animal behavior that other authors so
 often use co define us: here is a clear and telling examination of a hitherto
 almost unknown organism-the human female. Any woman wanting to know
 who she really is will find out in the pages of chis tremendously important work
 of real science by a real scientist:'
