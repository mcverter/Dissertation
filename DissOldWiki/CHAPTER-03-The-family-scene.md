# CHAPTER THREE The family scene

## Summary

I am not entirely clear whether this is needs to be an entire chapter.
On the one hand, it is merely a continuation of the last chapter. On the other hand, chapter nine on "Re-ligare" revists the thematics of the family in a very detailed way. In any case, I wil here attempt to expand my notes.

I have addressed a lot of these ideas before in my 2008 paper "Levinas Perverter". [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/mitchell-cowen-verter-levinas-perverter](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/mitchell-cowen-verter-levinas-perverter)

At the end of last chapter we had interrogated the practice of using militaristic metaphors in the text of philosophy. Levinas replaces a great deal of this analysis with the metaphorics of family relationships. The flux of Becoming emerges not from a clash of forces but from a continous creation, a continuous process of birth death and rebirth. As mentioned in last chapter, Totality and Infinity can very straightforwardly be read as a mystical reification of the heterosexual family. To be clear: this is not the explicit analysis in the book, but a close reading of the metaphorical language makes this reading clear. Section by section, the narrative of Totality and Infinity can be understood as (1) birth into childhood (2) adolescence (3) Marriage to a woman (4) Getting a job (5) Old Age (6)Death (7) Heterosexual intercourse (8) Rebiirth as a child.

This storyline has been widely criticized, from numerous authors starting such as Simone de Beauvoir, Tina Chanter, and Simon Crithcley. My response to this is multidimensional: first of all, because Levinas uses deliberately gendered language, he allows us to inspect the implicitly gendered quality of much of our conceptualization -- for example much of our conceptualization of subjectivity is based on a "virile" conception of masculine self-assertion. Secondly, Levinas's description of both the Self and of the Other describe both masculine and feminine traits so there is a type of queerness, a subversion perversion and inversion, that occurs in his writing. However, it is not the same type of queerness described by a writer such as Judith Butler nor of the contemporary maxim that "gender is a spectrum". Levinas very deliberately employs a gender binary, but by reading him closely we can open up the problematic of gender as such.

I am not entirely sure whether the above analysis is that important for the political argument of my dissertation. However, I am making some very major claims about Levinas's work and making very deliberate interventions into Levinas scholarship. In fact, one of the reasons why radical thinkers such as Critchley are uneasy about Levinas is because it does indeed appear to be a mystical fantasy of normative heterosexuality.

Finally, let's discuss why this discussion is even important in the first place. As mentioned before, the familial model of Becoming provides an alternative to the polemical model. Secondly, identifying traditionally masculine and feminine concepts allows us to directly question patriarchal motifs and to attempt to open up historically neglected networks of feminine conceptualization. In the following chapters, I will be exploring conceptions of maternity, materiality, consumption, and economy as oiko-nomos, all of which are inspired by my close reading of Levinas. Furthermore, I wish to preserve the category of the "family" as an interesting category for consideration. I expand upon this analysis in chapter nine, but in short: Levinas uses the metaphorics of the family to illustrate a concept he also refers to as "re-ligare", or ethical yoking together. In this sense, the family represents a pre-social and pre-political ethical commitment that people have towards each other, what Alphonso Lingis might call "The community of those who have nothing in common". The problematic of "family" occurs in so many places outside of the contemporary nuclear family, including among religious communities, the socialist left, and the fascist right. For this reason, it is a worthy to think through it carefully which we shall do in a later chapter.
