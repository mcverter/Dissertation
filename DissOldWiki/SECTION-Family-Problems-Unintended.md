                (5) PROBLEMS (I):  The “intentional family”
*                     (a) This is what is wrong with the idea of the “intentional family”
*                     (b) The family is pre-intentional, pre-voluntary, previous to society and politics
*                     (c) Against voluntarism in anarchism generally
*                     (d) https://thegavoice.com/community/features/radical-faeries-and-unintended-family/
*                     (e) Religare as a connection that is pre-social and pre-political
*                     (f) example:
*                         (i) brother fighting with step-father after mother’s death and myself fighting with brothers
*                     (g) because family is precisely a bond that is not voluntary, relations we are obligated to whether or not we like them, whether or not they love us or we love them, whether or not they have traumatized them or they have traumatized us
