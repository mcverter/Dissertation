getting to the bottom of those 
support people survivign while on strike
giving out masks
free heathcare

sets up an inventory of good and bad and accusatory

tj is mutual aid
transformative jsutice

it's always hard
starting again always
always adjusting

internalized capitalism
if i can't do it perfectly i should not do it

a society where we throw people away

mutual aid between two people

including strangers
maldistibution 

valences
vs 
how to name the political strategy

strangers between people we know

intimacy of relaitonship vs context
want harm to stop
someone will come along and do it

expertise and bosses
illegitimate authority
i will barrel my wil lthough

self assessments
self values

take accountability for imperfection

so much is about interdependence
what we value about interdependence 
our species is not going to survive and also how we get along with each other
disposabilty cutlure  
mass incarceration
when violence or harm not just about these wtwo people it influences everyuone

the more you invest in yoursel fand your own skills and the better you will be at interdependance

everything is making us isolated and making us afraid to interact with each other
podmaping

all based in volunteers

pods is a scaffolding on which we can use the work
vulnerability is the only way to build trust
trust is the oly way to have relatinships

how are we actually going to do that?
interdependence

we are all one in the same
we are all connected
what we do to the land is connected to the way the way we are to each other
interdependence
we are able to meet each other's needs

divest from our lives

intense individuation

not seeing nature as separate
separate from other peopls's lives
integrate it thoughout their lives

everything can be done through our political values
enough community to chew through that together

not have to find the bad people

having boundaries with this person who hurt me in this way

not based on excluding or making peole have to be perfect

risks to be authentic
i need to let myself be known
how i really think abou tmyself
authenticity
vulnerability
is how the world has wounded you

how do we practice the world we want right now

fear of being cut off from the people they love
that dynamic is something we allow to happen
culture of dispositiblity 

ablish who are we excluding
social norms of expressing yourself
a person who is allowed to go work
such a narrow  place to operate

wheter or not people like each other

deep internal  why do i feel an aversion

bring awaerenss and conditoins

who gets to be understood and who gets to be cared for and 

ableism is how we is valueable and who is not 

extract value and dispose of those communities
we will just put tem away
we don't care about them
and we toss them aaway+

not hard to find tenderness
not deseving of care

not be perfectionist

dont kmowtrans stuff'
can see possiniliy

access to one person

alwasys hard and messy

relationships require support 
they don't happen in an isolation

we are all social beings being influenced by others 
leverage in relationships 

not trying to thrown me away

pragmaticism
drag them it is n't transformative justice
do whatever you want


really isolated
the more people we have the more likely it is that we can support each other

romance myth
