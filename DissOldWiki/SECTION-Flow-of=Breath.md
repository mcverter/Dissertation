Flow of Breath paper:
*                         (viii)   During whatever moment and within whatever situation we find ourselves, we are always breathing. Beneath our consciousness, automatically, autonomically, air flows in and out of our bodies. Rarely are we aware of this fundamental part of our existence, yet we could not survive without it. What does the mundane fact of breathing mean? What could we learn by contemplating it?  The everyday process of breathing has an ethical profundity. During     the time span of a breath, our egos are disrupted and we are opened to that which is other than ourselves. This can already be appreciated with a straightforward observation: 63 percent of my body is oxygen. Oxygen is not something that I merely use; it is something that I am; something that constitutes my substance. The oxygen that enters into me through my breathing becomes me, transforming from a part of the atmosphere into the person who I am. Not only was it once part of the ambient, this oxygen that is me in the present was other beings in the past, and will be others in the future. Through my breath, otherness invades and constitutes my very self. The fact that all conditions rely on each other displays another, deeper truth of Buddhism. Even more vigorously than Levinas, many schools of Buddhism stress that all things are empty of own-being (svabhava). As mentioned above, early Buddhism opposed the Vedic notion that there is a supreme Self (Atman) behind all phenomenon.  In response, various Buddhist traditions developed not only the idea of nonselfhood (annata) but also of emptiness (sunnata).19 All phenomena exist only by virtue of their conditioned relationships with each other, and they are therefore empty of any substantial nature. The ground for any sort of becoming whatsoever relies on the fact that all things are at bottom empty. Only because all dhammas are empty of any self-subsistent nature can there be any dependent co-origination, the dynamic transformation of one phenomenon into another.    By becoming aware of the annata and sunnata of all dhammas, and of the absence of one's own self-nature, the practitioner learns to transcend personal selfishness. The practitioner begins to under- stand that there is no separate, self-subsistent entity named I, and that the world cannot be reduced to a relationship with my own self, to being mine. In a passage strikingly similar to Levinas's account of the self 's "living from" the elements, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu explains, "Throughout our lives we have been thieves. We have been stealing things that exist naturally" in and belonging to nature -- namely, the conditions (sa?khara). We have plundered them and taken them to be our selves and our possessions." 20 The Buddhist practice of mindful breathing is thus an ethical practice aimed at dispossessing the self of these stolen goods. Through the mindful observation of the arising and passing of phenomena, I resist the temptation to reduce everything to my own perspective, to think that I am the person who is breathing and that the sensations feelings and thoughts that arise belong to me, that they are mine. I must be able to acknowledge the real presence of these states existing in a place called me, identifying myself as those experiences, while also not claiming that a separated self has ownership of them. By releasing from such attachment to one's own self, one starts toward liberation from suffering.  Beyond one's own liberation from suffering, this detachment has a wider ethical purpose. Just as uncontrolled emotions can wreak havoc, so can unregulated selfishness. By overcoming this egoism, one can impact society in a meaningful way. Santikaro Bhikkhu explains that, by allowing us to understand and detach ourselves from the need to find ourselves in everything, anapanasati helps us to let go of the selfishness that is destroying our lives and our worlds."21 So much conflict and violence is born out of selfishness; detachment from self- hood ultimately intends to bring about peace.  13
*                         (ix) For this reason, anapanasati meditation is often practiced alongside loving-kindness (metta) meditation, in a prayer for the wellbeing of all breathing beings (sabbe pana):  Whatsoever breathing beings there are — trembling, firm, or any other. . . . / those who are seen, and those who are unseen, those who live far away, those who are near, those who are born, and those who still seek birth — may all beings in their hearts be happy! . . . In the same way as a mother would protect her child, her only child, with her life, so toward all beings [the practitioner] should develop the measureless thought. Towards the whole wide world he should develop the measureless thought of lovingkindness, above, below, and across, without barriers, hate, or enemy.

Conclusion    By opening up the meditations by Levinas on la respiration and by Buddhism on mindful breathing to each other, we have taken note of similarities in how they consider this everyday activity. For both Levinas and Buddhism, a focus on breathing demonstrates deeper truths about the temporality of dynamic becoming. Time empties all entities of their self-identity, detaching them from their selves. It renders all selfhood radically open to an invasion by what is other than self. Through the course of time, otherness becomes transformed into an empty, vanishing point of selfhood. When one focuses on breathing and becomes aware of its deeper significance, one can thus effect an ethical transformation, a change that turns the self inside out and opens it to the other.   Beyond observing these important similarities between Levinas and Buddhism, what else can this extended meditation on breathing teach us? What other responsibilities does it engender? Now that we understand that we are connected to each other through our breathing, what responsibilities do we take on for each other's breathing  and for the air that we share with each other?    At the very least, this meditation on breathing should help us to apply both Buddhism and Levinas to environmental ethics. Thich Nhat Hanh explains that the Buddhist insight into the interrelatedness of all things already makes it the oldest tradition of deep ecology.23
*                         (xi) In Otherwise than Being, Levinas similarly indicates that, even before  20 any confrontation with the other, the self already becomes ethically  responsible through its submergence in the elemental milieu.    In his book, Terror from the Air, Peter Sloterdijk explains that the twentieth century witnessed the invention of gas warfare, a technique that turned people's everyday practice of breathing against them, by turning their means to life into a "breathing-unto-death." 24 Not only has this constituted a way of attacking others, it is also part of the violence that we are committing against ourselves. Toward the end of his book, Sloterdijk quotes a solemn speech by Elias Canetti: "To nothing is man so open as to air. . . . Air is the last common property. It belongs to all people collectively. It is not doled out in advance. Even the poorest may partake of it. And this last thing which has  belonged to all of us collectively shall poison all of us collectively."25 Can we avoid this terrifying fate?  The air that surrounds us constitutes the substance of our selves and of infinite others; taking care of our atmosphere enacts our responsibility both toward nature and toward humanity. Reflecting on breathing through Levinas and Buddhism can therefore remind us that taking care of the environment is one of the most profound ways in which we can take responsibility for the other. We can thus learn to hearken to the "Prayer to Future Beings" invoked by environmental activist and Buddhist teacher Joanna Macy:
*                         (xii) You live inside us, beings of the future.  In the spiral ribbons of our cells, you are here. In our rage for the  burning forests, the poisoned fields, the oil-drowned seals, you are  here. You beat in our hearts through late-night meetings. You accompany us to clear-cuts and toxic dumps and the halls of the lawmakers.  It is you who drive our dogged labors to save what is left. O you who will walk this Earth when we are gone, stir us awake.  Behold through our eyes the beauty of this world. Let us feel your  breath in our lungs, your cry in our throat. Let us see you in the poor,  the homeless, the sick. Haunt us with your hunger, hound us with  your claims, that we may honor the life that links us. You have as yet no faces we can see, no names we can say. But we  need only hold you in our mind, and you teach us patience. You attune  us to measures of time where healing can happen, where soil and souls 13  can mend. You reveal courage within us we had not suspected, love we    20  had not owned. O you who come after, help us remember: we are your ancestors.   Fill us with gladness for the work that must be done.26
