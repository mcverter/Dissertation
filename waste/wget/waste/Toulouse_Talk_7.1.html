<p> Already I should apologize for misspeaking. This talk was written while I was on the run, wandering in foreign
    homelands, perpetually between here and there, rarely having a place to settle down to read think and write,
    occasionally finding refuge at a coffee shop or a friend's house, in locations where I constantly had to ask others
    questions to orient myself, petitioning them with inquiries: "How do I get to there" "What is this place" "Where is
    the metro" "Where is the bathroom." Unable to carry everything with me, I left too many important books back home in
    New York, so I regret that this talk is already missing too many pieces.</p>
<p> But, even if there were a stable location from which I could have written this talk, I still fear that this very
    event of speaking right here, right now would already position me in a space where I must misspeak.What exile is
    perpetuated when one must simultaneously convey one's thoughts to an audience composed of people who speak different
    languages? Martin Heidegger famously stated that language, der Sprache, was the house of Being; Levinas
    rearticulated this Heideggerean motif by discovering the initial ethical relation as a discursive one,
    conceptualizing of language (la langue) as the primordial generosity one gives to the other, of saying the Said, as
    an incessant obligation. Yet isn't speaking making a statement, which is also proclaiming an allegiance to a
    political state, to a native language, to a mother tongue. As soon as I open my mouth in this place here, don't I
    already situate myself as a foreigner, find myself making others feel foreign. </p>
<p> This talk will be a meditation on Levinas's statement in "Judaism and the Feminine" that "`The house is woman' the
    Talmud tells us"; "La maison est femme, le Talmud nous dit." already a resaying of the Talmud's saying "Beito zou
    ishto." I will meditate upon this testimony in order to continue my longtime project of developing an
    anarchafeminist reading of Levinas. In this paper, I will try to rethink the space of the home as an ethical
    alternative to the space of the political, thereby responding to the overasked question of how one can apply
    Levinas' ethical thought to political situations by suggesting that before we make this leap, we should first
    consider the home as an anarchic subversion the political.</p>
<p>ARISTOTLE: DOMESTIC DOMINATION</p>
<p> Insofar as we consider this Jewish thinker to be a philosopher, it is still useful to position his thought within
    the philosophical tradition, beginning where the philosophy begins, in Greek. Aristotle commences the Politics by
    explaining that the  ???? is a type of community (??????? ) that man establishes in order to live a good life. Among
    the other types of ???????  is the home or ?????, which is encompassed within to the  ???? through a relation of
    containment and domination: the household forms a unitary part within the totality of the state and all of its
    functions are ultimately subordinate to the operations of the state. These two communal spheres intersect in one
    point: the person of the     ? ??, or patriarch who proves himself in the polis through the excellence of his
    ?? ? ? , his manliness, who exerts absolute power over the household through ?????? ??, the ordering of the
    household and the acquisition of property. That is, the domestic sphere is established by the dominus through a
    process of domestification and domination. The first type of property Aristotle describes is the slave, a human
    being who is little better than an ox, a domesticated animal, wholly belonging to the master. Although not as lowly
    as the slave, Aristotle similarly describes the wife and children as being naturally subordinate to the dominion of
    the patriarch. Hannah Arendt endorses this as a necessary domination "Because men were dominated by the necessities
    of life, they could win their freedom only through the domination of those whom they subjected by force."</p>
<p> The Aristotlean tradition has bequeathed to us a conception of the home as a site for the domination of the
    patriarch and for the genitive conversion of everything into his property. In light of this conception, I would like
    to raise the following questions</p>
<p> (1) Aren't there other ways to conceptualize the home that do not normalize these hierarchies AND that do not evince
    Arendt's contempt for human vulnerability? Can't we consider the home as a site for responsibility for the needs of
    other people, as a place for caring refuge and hospitality? </p>
<p> (2) Can't we think of the home as something with its own integrity, which does not depend upon its position within
    the state? Can the home become a model for a new mode of empathetic human relations based on caring refuge and
    hospitality, one that subverts the hierarchies and agonism of the state?</p>
<p> (3) What happens when the state and the home are mixed up, when the home is considered as part of the state or the
    state is considered a type of home? </p>
<p>FROM DER AUFENTHALT TO LA MAISON</p>
<p> Whereas ancient philosophy considered the home as a unit within the state, contemporary phenomenological thought has
    discovered it as a fundamental component within man's spatial existence. In Being and Time, Heidegger not only
    replaces the idea of mathematical clock time with the three modes of ecstatic temporality, he also challenges the
    idea of Cartesian space as a set of neutral coordinates with a new conception of spatiality. Human beings exist as
    Dasein, a Being-There, a Being whose existence defines and is defined by a Da, a there. Heidegger explains that
    Dasein's Insein "`In' stems from innan-, to live, habitare, to dwell ... `Ich bin' means I dwell, I stay near." In
    his later essays, Heidegger continues to elaborate upon this conception of Dasein as the entity that dwells.
    Locations are not merely spots upon a map, but already sites in which are gathered the fourfold: earth and sky, men
    and deities. However, Heidegger laments that men have forgotten the meaning of Being and thereby have become
    homeless. This, he claims, results from a reversal of dominion: men, because they have asserted the domination of
    their own subjectivity instead of realizing they dwell within the domain of Being and under Being's domination.</p>
<p> As with many of his concepts, Levinas derives his conception of the Home from Heidegger. He essentially echoes
    Heidegger's critique of neutral Cartesian coordinates, claiming that the signification of the ethical is a
    precondition for the emergence of homogenous space. However, Levinas refutes Heidegger's conception by denying that
    nonhuman powers - language, Being, the fourfold - are responsible for the presencing of locations. This refutation
    of Heideggerian spatiality is also legible in one of Levinas's fundamental concepts: Whereas Dasein's Being
    manifests through the there of its Da, Levinas describes the y, the there of the il y a, as an anonymous
    possession. </p>
<p> According to Levinas, it is the ethical existence of human beings that first creates space. Amidst the elemental
    contents that suffuse the il y a is produced an individual existent who stands out from existence. Levinas explains
    this achievement as a being-at-home with oneself, saying "Man abides in the world as having come to it from a
    private domain, from being at home with himself, to which at each moment he can retire." The home therefore is not a
    responsiveness to the forces of being as in Heidegger, but rather a localization of selfhood, an establishment of
    one's proper perspective, a place where things can be referred to oneself, a site for recollection, representation,
    and the acquisition of property.</p>
<p> From this preliminary definition of home emerge several other motifs in Levinas's work. For example, proximity that
    thwarts even this basic event of self-localization, "It is not a state, a repose, but a restlessness, a null site,
    outside the place of rest." Within Totality and Infinity and throughout his work, Levinas connects the idea of the
    home, the ?????, with the call from economic justice. Whereas one finds oneself situated safely within the home, the
    Other person reveals himself as foreign, as homeless, destitute and abandoned. Levinas explains how this revelation
    constitutes a demand, saying, "The `vision' of the face as face is a certain mode of sojourning in a home, or-to
    speak in a less singular fashion-a certain form of economic life. No human or interhuman relationship can be enacted
    outside of economy; no face can be approached with empty hands and closed home. Recollection in a home open to the
    Other-hospitality-is the concrete and initial fact of human recollection and separation; it coincides with the
    Desire for the Other absolutely transcendent." </p>
<p> Now finally we can consider the Talmud saying contemplated by the essay "Judaism and the Feminine": "the house is
    woman." Within the Jewish tradition, the woman is considered the guardian of the household, most prominently as the
    one who lights the Sabbath candles, creating the hearth that serves as the replacement for the Jewish temple. We
    should consider the name of the feminine to be Beth, mother of MacBeth, both the secondary and the house, the BAYIT
    that encloses the primary ROSH in the beginning BRAISHIT. Levinas's citation is most evidently a gloss on his claim
    in Totality and Infinity that the home depends on the presence of the woman. This presence of the Woman does not
    refer only to concrete woman but also implies that there are masculine and feminine aspects within each individual,
    both within the Self and within the Other . The principal role of the feminine dwelling is to provide the site for
    reversion, the base of welcoming (accueil) for recollection (recueillement), of acceptance for receptivity. Levinas
    describes this phenomenological production, saying "this refers us to its essential interiority, and to the
    inhabitant that inhabits it before every inhabitant, the welcoming par excellence, welcome in itself - the feminine
    being". If Levinas here characterizes feminine alterity by the "welcome" it offers, then we can only conclude that I
    am figured as a woman only a few pages later. "I welcome the Other who presents himself in my home by opening my
    home to him". In fact, my identification as a welcoming woman is the very basis of Levinasian ethics: "metaphysics,
    transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same, of the other by me, is concretely produced as the calling
    into question of the same by the other, that is, as ethics that accomplishes the critical essence of
    knowledge." </p>
<p> Levinas amplifies his rhetoric of motherhood and home in his later writing. Within Otherwise than Being, he states,
    "Signification signifies in nourishing clothing, lodging, in maternal relations, in which matter shows itself for
    the first time in its materiality." It should be noted that these relations are not simply maternal but also
    household: that the house is typically he site in which one is nourished, clothed and lodged. Levinas makes this
    connection more explicit in his observation that the Hebrew word for mercy, RAHAMIM, derives from RAHAM, meaning
    womb, the first house the individual existent, the place where it is first nourished, lodged and given
    maternal/material sustenance.</p>
<p>FEMINIST MOTHERS, FEMINIST HOUSEHOLDS: LEVINAS AND AMERICAN FEMINISM</p>
<p> In Of Woman Born, Adrienne Rich explains that "the child gains her first sense of her own existence from the
    mother's responsive gestures and expressions. It's as if in the mother's eyes, her smile, her stroking touch, the
    child first reads the message: You are there!" Nel Noddings further glosses, "This is the child's inner reaction to
    the parent's response `I am here.'" Isn't this a direct echo of Levinas's idea of the me voici, that the testimony
    of self already depends on a prior receptiveness of the other person, a mother who recognizes the attestation of
    primordial consciousness. In "Maternal Thinking", Sara Ruddick similarly describes the mother as the one who
    responds to the demands of the child. "Children `demand' that their lives be preserved and their growth be fostered.
    Their social group `demands' that their growth be shaped in a way acceptable to the next generation. Maternal
    practice is governed by (at least) three interests in satisfying these demands for preservation, growth, and
    acceptability." Among the practices that inform maternal action is the ability to attend to the needs of another
    person, which Ruddick explains by citing Simone Weil, "The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means
    being able to say to him: `What are you going through?' ... Only he who is capable of attention can do this."</p>
<p> The writings of certain feminists also provide useful resonances with Levinas with regards to the home. bell hooks
    provides an insight into what Levinas calls recollection (recuillement) in her discussion of "homeplace" as a place
    of sanctuary where we could return for "renewal and self-recovery, where we can heal our wounds and become whole."
    In a similar vein, Nancy Folbre in her book "The Invisible Heart" explores the way that the type of nurturing
    sustenance dispensed within the home is the invisible basis for everything else that occurs in our society of
    calculative negotiation. As an alternative to wealth as a measure of value, she provides an intriguing
    counterexample: Folbre raises the hypothetical of how long it might take someone who was locked out of her house to
    borrow a phone from someone else. The feelings of belonging, of being safe, of being part of a community, of
    trusting one's neighbors, are not easily measured in terms of money, she explains, yet they are crucial for human
    existence. Folbre's example thus explores a case in which one is temporarily homeless and discovders a supreme
    social value in the idea that someone might grant you refuge. </p>
<p> Folbre's text is one of the several that employ ideas of motherhood and the home to develop new political
    alternatives. I will now continue to mention other such feminist efforts, of whether we can transform public space
    from a political sphere of agonism, of power, of manipulation, and of calculation, into a space of caring and
    hospitality. Furthermore, even though I am employing the term politics, I wonder whether we can do this by
    reconsidering the home as an anarchic, ethical subversion of the political. </p>
<p> Sara Ruddick proposes that we should "transform maternal thought into the public realm, and make the preservation
    and growth of all children a work of public conscience and legislation," setting as one's priorities "world
    protection, world-preservation, world-repair." Jennifer Scuro employs the work of Vandana Shiva to remind us that
    the root notion of ecology is oikos, home, and calls for a renewal of a global ecopolitics of homeplace, with a
    renewed emphasis on the rights of indigenous peoples and the dignity of the environment. Similar to Ruddick and
    Folbre, Virginia Held argues that the caring must be brought into the political realm "Values and practices of care
    most discernible in personal relations have fundamental implications for social life and political organization."
    She thus embraces the idea of global civil society through the growth of civic associations based on relationships
    of care. </p>
<p> I think that Held's idea of associations is quite similar to those forwarded by anarchocomunists such as Petr
    Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta. On this point, I would actually like to point out that, inspired largely by Levinas
    the Hebrew Bible and the prophets, I have dedicated a good part of my own anarchist political organizing since 1997
    to the opening of squats, occupying and expropriating abandoned formerly private property in order to open it up as
    refuge to all. </p>
<p>THE SEMITIC HOME</p>
<p> Although we started with our discussion in the Greek with Aristotle, we must complete our investigation of this
    Jewish thinker by turning towards the Semitic. Levinas dedicates Otherwise than Being to the memory of those who
    were closest among the six million assassinated by the National Socialists, and of the millions on millions of all
    confessions and all nations, victims of the same hatred of the other man, the same anti-Semitism." What is the
    significance of this refusal of anti-Semitism; of this same hatred of the other? Does it not amount to a refusal of
    fratricide, a refusal to repeat the original murder of Cain against Abel, the refusal to reiterate the horrible
    alibi "Am I my brother's keeper?" - and I would like to add of ones sisters and of the children.\ Here I am of
    course referring to the murder being perpetuated by the Israeli government against those who are practically their
    brothers. I am calling right here, right now, right in front of you, for an end to the genocidal violence that the
    Israeli regime is committing against the Palestinians. `</p>
<p> The most agonizing part of this affair is that so much of it rotates around the thematic of the home. The original
    Zionists wanted to create a house of refuge for the Jewish people, to bring them back home from their perpetual
    wandering upon the earth, to put an end to their persecution. But what about the people who were already calling
    that land their home? Among Zionists there was a variety of opinions about it, but unfortunately most of those who
    ultimately took control and who remain in control grew out of the right wing, endeavoring to establish a Greater
    Land of Israel that would belong to Jewish people. For example, among the 18 Principles of Rebirth enunciated by the
    paramilitary organization Lehi are " (1) The nation: The Jewish people is a covenanted people, the originator of
    monotheism, formulator of the prophetic teachings, standard bearer of human culture, guardian of glorious patrimony;
    (2) The homeland: The homeland in the Land of Israel within the borders delineated in the Bible ("To your
    descendants, I shall give this land, from the River of Egypt to the great Euphrates River. Genesis 15:18). This is
    the land of the living, where the entire nation shall live in safety; (10) Conquest: The conquest of the homeland
    from foreign rule and its eternal possession."</p>
<p> The ideological program of the Jewish homeland enunciated by Lehi and Revisionist Zionism and today's Likud party
    and many others is being enacted right now through the creation of Jewish Settlements in Palestinian territories.
    Many settlers freely acknowledge that the purpose of these settlements is to prevent the creation of a Palestinian
    state in the Jewsih homeland. Supported by the Israeli government, Jews are being allowed to steal land from the
    Palestinian people, forcibly evicting them from their homes, bulldozing their properties, tearing down their olive
    groves, taking from them the best natural resources, the prime acuifers and the most fecund agricultureal land. In
    addition to building settlements on these lands and refusing the Palestinians the right to enter and use them, the
    Settlements have been strategically located in such a way that they freagment the continuity of Palestinian
    proeprty, leaving them isolated in ghettos deprived of water food healthcare and education. Between settlements are
    networks of highways which Palestinainas are forbidden to use, preventing them from returning to their homes, from
    visiting friends relatives and neighbors, from going to hospitals clinics and schools. In additon, setlers are given
    free reight to murder and comit other acts of terror against the Palestinaina population, often with the express
    consent if not the actual material support of the Israeli military. Worse yet, the Israeli state engages in
    indiscrimiate slaughter in places liek Gaza. Such harrassment and violence has one aim only: to harrass and
    indimiate people - to ethnically cldeans the Palestinians from the Jewish homeland.</p>
<p> The most horrific example of this fratricidal mentality is currently being expressed by the political party Israel
    Beitenu, Israel Our Home, whose racism is not so different Menachem Begin, Benjamin Netanyahu, Yitzhak Shamir.
    Israeli Beitenu attempts to promote the Jewish character of the State of Israel by fulfilling the three basic
    principles of Zionism : immigration to Israel (aliyah), defending the land and settlement activity, thereby enticing
    Jews from all over to return home to the secure Jewish homeland. Beitenu freely uses the image of Israel as a house
    of refuge, but this refuge is constituted as OUR HOME, the home of Jews who have emigrated mostly from Eastern
    Europe to colonize the land; it is OUR HOME, not the home of the Palestinians who already live there. Whereas
    foreigners are treated as natives, the natives are turned into exiles. This attitude has been expressed in numerous
    racist statements and policies by ISRAEL BEITENU, most prominently in the effort to force all Israeli citizens to
    take a loyalty oath, a clear effort to delegitimize and alienate the Arabs living in Israel as an fifth column
    internal to the Jewish State who are "likely to serve as terrorist agents on behalf of the Palestinian Authority." .
    This hatred of the other man, this constant anti-Semitism has also been expressed in legislative efforts to outlaw
    the commemoration of the Nakba, to ban of free speech critical of the Israeli state, to indoctrination of Jewish
    values and Zionist ideology in schools, to make it illegal it illegal to give aid or shelter to Arab refugees, and
    to transfer Arab citizens out of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, I would like reiterate to main points</p>
<p>(1) PHILOSOPHY: We should use Levinas's reflections on the home together with feminist thinking to think of ways to
    anarchically subvert the of the political</p>
<p>(2) ETHICAL: We must as scholars of Levinas demand an immediate end to the anti Semitism, to the genocide, to the
    ethnic cleansing, to the apartheid being practiced right now in Israel against the Palestinian people.</p>
