<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;
line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:200%'>Levinas:
FOR THE KIDS!!!</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“The state of
nausea that precedes vomiting, and from which vomiting will deliver us,
encloses us on all sides.&nbsp; we are revolted from the inside; our depths
smother beneath ourselves; even our hearts are sick -- Emmanuel Levinas, 1935, <span lang=FR>“</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“
People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints, such people have a corpse in their mouth. -- Raoul Vaneigem, 1967
<span lang=FR>“</span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Against
philosophies that propose impersonal origins, Levinas’s thought describes a
continuous creation of gendered generations.  In this family drama, one begins
life in the infantile state of enjoyment; then gets married to the woman who
opens up the home; then becomes a man who owns property and produces works;
then has sex and dies; then is reborn in a new generation as a son.  It often
seems as if Manhood is somehow the telos of this genealogy.  In many ways, the
“Face-to-Face” relationship described in <i>Totality and Infinity </i>is figured
as a “Man-to-Man” relationship.  One is welcomed by the feminine alterity of
the home, but facehood <i>qua</i> facehood seems to be the property of an adult
male.  Only a man can manifest himself as a sovereign speaker, as a master who
presents his words.  Thus, I am eminently responsible to <i>l’autre homme</i>,
the Other Man, the brother I meet through fraternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            The correlation of
ethical responsibility to masculine adulthood is reinforced by Levinas’s 1957
essay “A Religion for Adults” and <i>Totality and Infinity</i>’s<i> </i>section
“The Mythical Format of the Element.”  Paganism bathes one in the childlike
innocence of elemental, oceanic consciousness, subjecting one to possession by
anonymous forces.  Against this, Judaism tears one away from mere enthusiasm
and positions the individual as an adult, as person who already exists in a
state of ethical responsibility, who must already follow commands and perform
duties.  Levinas avers “my consciousness as a man” – again, as an adult male – is
contemporaneous with “the consciousness of any natural injustice, of the harm
caused to the Other, by my ego structure.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></span></a>,
which Levinas elsewhere refers to as an offense perpetrated on <i>man</i>.<a
href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Although the Face-to-Face
does describe a relationship between adult males, it would wrong to consider
this relationship as the goal of one’s ethical development.  Although Levinas
only employs the term “ethical” in certain sections of his texts, each moment of
his genealogy opens up a new perspective, a different ethical orientation
towards the Other, a different hyperbolic Riemann curvature of intersubjective
space.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Alongside the
Man-to-Man, Face-to-Face relationship, different ethical perspectives are
denoted by every figure and every metaphoric that Levinas introduces in his
writing.  Already in <i>Totality and Infinity</i>, Levinas describes the ethics
of fecundity:  erotic love is not only a relationship with the Beloved, but
also engenders a child, a messianic future of new hopes.  Furthermore, the
figure of the “orphan” does not merely refer to a biblical motif, but subtly
alludes to the moment of Need felt in the heart of childlike Enjoyment.<a
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> 
Through fecundity, one is already ethically responsible in relation to the
consumption of others, committed “FOR THE KIDS!!!”, for all those born into misery,
for all those lost in the supermarket of empty commodities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Levinas deepens
his meditation on the ethical significance of youth throughout the sixties.  In
his essay on the May 1968 student and worker uprisings, “No Identity”, Levinas
states that “Youth, which the philosopher loves is the ‘before being, the
otherwise than being.’”<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[4]</span></span></span></a>
  He praises this radical political movement:<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[5]</span></span></span></a>
“among the most imperative sentiments of May 1968 was the refusal of a humanity
that would be defined not by its vulnerability .. but by its self-satisfaction.
… the person understood as an accumulation of being, by merits, titles,
professional competence … instituting a heirarchized society maintained beyond
the necessities of consumption.”<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[6]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Levinas’s remarks
demonstrate some interesting affinities to one of the texts that inspired the
uprisings, Raoul Vaneigem’s <i>Traité du savoir-vivre à l'usage des jeunes generations,
</i>known in English as <i>The Revolution of Everyday Life. </i>A more literal
translation of the title, however would better demonstrate that this glorious
affirmation of free subjectivity is not mere egoism, but is straightaway an ethical
declaration <i>à l'usage des jeunes generations, </i>for the usage of the young
generations, an immediate responsibility “FOR THE KIDS!!!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Vaneigem’s
critique of everyday life can be understood as emerging from Karl Marx and
Georg Lukacs’s analysis of commodity fetishism and reification.  Under capitalism,
all social relationships between persons appear as commodity relationships
between things.  Because all human existence is mediated through these
apparently objective, impersonal structures, men are alienated from the
products of labor, from nature, from other men, and ultimately from
themselves.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Vaneigem writes at
a certain juncture in the development of capitalism in which the domination
over production was in the process of being complemented by the domination over
consumption.  As has become obvious in today’s world oversaturated by
spectacles, capitalism not only controls the process and product of labor, but
also dictates the way that one enjoys one’s own leisure time.  Vaneigem states,
“The dictatorship of the consumable … perfects the real mastery of dead things
over men.”<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> 
He repeatedly laments the way that consumerism is crushing the youth, making
them “children doomed to age prematurely as soon as the market system has
transformed them into mere objects of passive consumption.”<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[8]</span></span></span></a> 
Personally, I fully concur with this profound sadness in seeing how much the
kids today are being coerced into identifying themselves with corporate
products<b>. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
commodification of existence not only impinges upon the expression of free
subjectivity, but also distorts the possibility of genuine interpersonal
relationships.  One constantly experiences the humiliation of being an object
to other people and one meets only with other objectified people, “cogs in the
general machine for destroying people.”<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[9]</span></span></span></a> 
Vaneigem decries the way that people represent themselves and perceive each
other according to roles, becoming “people who are crushed under their
wardrobes.”<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[10]</span></span></span></a> 
Vaneigem bemoans, “Who reduces a man’s life to this pathetic sequence of
clichés.  He does it himself, breaking his day down into a series of poses
chosen more or less unconsciously from the range of dominant stereotypes.”<a
href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[11]</span></span></span></a>  
It is important to not confuse this statement with an existentialist
condemnation of inauthenticity or an elitist avant-garde critique of kitsch
culture.  Vaneigem’s remark comes from a compassion towards those of us – all
of us – who are complicit in our own degradation, and from the defiant optimism
that affirms that we are more than just clichés.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Like Vaneigem,
Levinas also opposes the domination of roles, “violence ... makes persons play
roles in which they no longer recognize themselves, making them betray their
own substance.”<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[12]</span></span></span></a> 
In his analyses of the economy of phenomenon and expression, Levinas explains
that individuals express their interiority through external works, works that
could have been produced by and can be consumed by anybody in the impersonal
public realm.  This is how we generally encounter others, through their works,
consuming them as if they were products, entering their interiority by burglary.<a
href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[13]</span></span></span></a>
Thus, most of the time we meet another person not as an ethical <i>who, </i>a
human face, but rather as an ontological <i>what,</i> a thing with properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>To overcome this
dehumanization, Vaneigem recommends that we rediscover the spontaneity,
creativity, and poetry of our subjectivity.  Whether they know it or not,
people are continuously expressing their creativity, and need only to reawaken
their wills to live in order to bring new realities to being.  Until it is
crushed out of her by consumer society, the child maintains the greatest power
to affirm her daydreams, to transform her life, and to grasp her freedom.  Vaneigem
explains, “The child acquires a subjective experience of freedom unknown to any
other animal species. …. the child possesses a feeling of the continuous
transformation of the world, or poetry, to an unlimited degree.”<a
href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[14]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Levinas figures a
similarly exuberant childhood as the state of enjoyment, remarking that
“enjoyment is the very production of a being that is born … [and] encloses
itself in a person.”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[15]</span></span></span></a>
Levinas’s affirmation of this ecstatic state echoes the sentiments of Bataille
by declaring “To enjoy without utility in pure loss, gratuitously, without
referring to anything else, in pure expenditure – this is the human.”<a
href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[16]</span></span></span></a> 
That is, the humanity of the human and the subjectivity of the subject is
constituted by enjoyment.  One can not overemphasize the importance of this affective
joy.  The Face-to-Face would not be ethical if it did not begin from my own personal
enjoyment:  “Whatever be the transfigurations this egoism will receive from
speech, it is for the happiness constitutive of its very egoism that the I who
speaks pleads”.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[17]</span></span></span></a> 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I would argue that
it is within this realm of enjoyment that ethical responsibility emerges.  Once
Levinas’s work is understood to be a series of reversals,<a href="#_edn18"
name="_ednref18" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[18]</span></span></span></a>
it becomes clear that my enjoyment also doubles as an indigence, a lack, a
suffering riveted to being.   Furthermore, the Other’s destitution for which I
am responsible is the perspectival inversion of my own indigence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Although Levinas
dedicates his second major book to those “of all confessions and all nations,
victims of the hatred of the other man,”<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[19]</span></span></span></a>it
is not just the horror of man made mass death that we need to remember.  Vaneigem
reminds us: “will it need as much blood again to show that a hundred thousand
pinpricks kill as surely as a couple of blows with a club?”<a href="#_edn20"
name="_ednref20" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[20]</span></span></span></a> 
As memorializing suffering and protesting continuing atrocities, we must also
oppose the manifold ways we are degraded and conditioned in everyday life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Vaneigem cites an
“admirable principle” of Keats “&quot;Everything that can be annihilated must
be annihilated so that children may be saved from slavery&quot;<a href="#_edn21"
name="_ednref21" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[21]</span></span></span></a> 
As a gloss, we can adduce Levinas’ statement from his essay on May 1968 “the
condition (or the uncondition) of being strangers and slaves in the land of Egypt brings man close to his neighbor.  In their uncondition of being strangers
men seek one another.”<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[22]</span></span></span></a> 
I would claim one’s responsibility to the other is not merely to undo her
enslavement, but to encourage her liberty, to help her discover and embrace
that which makes her free.  A pre-original anarchism obligates us to what
Levinas calls “my responsibility for the freedom of others.”<a href="#_edn23"
name="_ednref23" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[23]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I would like to
claim that one is not only responsible for the other’s suffering but also for
their pleasure.  Vaneigem explains the authentic communication of genuine love,
saying “To love only oneself through other people, to be loved by others
through the love they owe themselves.”<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[24]</span></span></span></a> 
This sentiment does not express some empty egoism, but rather echoes Levinas’s
explanation of love as a voluptuousity that delights in the voluptuousity of
the beloved, perhaps even what Levinas refers to as the “wisdom of love”? The
foreigners, the strangers do not just want an end to discrimination for their
otherness, but as “Gentleman” Joe Strummer points out “the immigrants want to
sing all night long.”<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[25]</span></span></span></a>
As Simon Critchley urges, even if Levinas is correct that everything outside of
the Bible and the Greeks is dance, then “let’s dance, let’s dance all night,
let’s party hearty.”<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[26]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Critchley’s remark
should remind us that, in his later writings, Levinas maintains a constant
dialogue with philosophy’s greatest dancer, Friedrich Nietzsche.  Although
Levinas does dare to blaspheme against most infamous blasphemer in philosophy,
he deliberately reappropriates obviously Nietzschean concepts.  Zarathustra’s
Yes-Saying is reiterated as Levinas’s Saying in the form of Youth, the
lightness of a free spirit already denucleated of its center of gravity. The <i>Otherwise
than Being</i> of youth is inspired <i>Beyond Essence</i> through Nietzsche, of
whom Levinas asks rhetorically “Is not Nietzsche the exceptional breath to make
this ‘beyond’ resound?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Nietzsche’s
exceptional breath is exhaled in the form of laughter.  This can be understood
on two levels.  First of all, to laugh is to use one’s mouth in a way that
prohibits speaking.<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[27]</span></span></span></a> 
Levinas had previously introduced this distinction between laughter and speech
in <i>Totality and Infinity </i>through the witches of Macbeth<a href="#_edn28"
name="_ednref28" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[28]</span></span></span></a>,
whose laughter signals the ambiguity of a phenomenon that is manifested 
“an-archic[ally], without principle, without beginning,”<a href="#_edn29"
name="_ednref29" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[29]</span></span></span></a>
Levinas’s relocation, revocation of laughter through Nietzsche’s lips should
therefore be understood as a way of reconceptualizing ethical anarchism.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Levinas moves
beyond <i>Totality and Infinity</i> in his second book by further correlating
this laughter with the dynamics of breathing, an inspiration which is religious
prophecy rather than pagan possession.  Levinas states “the breathlessness of
inspiration that paralyzes essence, that transpierces it with an inspiration by
the other, an inspiration that is already expiration that ‘rends the soul.’” 
In this form, the laugh is almost indistinguishable from a cry.  It is the
sound made during the very trauma of birth. Levinas explains, “the human
subject – me – [is] called on the brink of tears and laughter to
responsibility.”<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[30]</span></span></span></a> 
Subjectivity itself is reborn as youth each moment, in a continuous creation, perpetually
“born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward”<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[31]</span></span></span></a>,
always laughing-crying at the wounds that tears it apart.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Levinas’s
reference to the exceptional quality of Nietzsche’s “breath” should remind us
of Alfred Jarry’s remarkable teaching of ‘pataphysics, “the science of the
particular … [that] examines the laws governing exceptions, … since the laws
that are supposed to have been discovered in the traditional universe are also
correlations of exceptions, albeit more frequent ones, but in any case
accidental data which, reduced to the status of unexceptional exceptions.”  Even
if commodity culture mass manufactures a series of formally identical<a
href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[32]</span></span></span></a>
objects, and each person is being objectified by the society of the spectacle,
nevertheless, each person undergoes his own history of accidents, of joys and
pains, has been scarred by time with unique identifying marks.  Time has
imprinted you through your vulnerability, through your openness to wounds and
outrage; time has left its traces in the places where you slit your wrists
because you can’t forget the guy you killed and where your girlfriend hit you
so you needed to move in with us and where you shot up your veins when you
could still get China white instead of brown tar and where years of living on
the streets have wrinkled you prematurely and where your facial piercings got
infected because you were train hopping and hadn’t showered in weeks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Levinas calls the
May 68 demonstrators, “<span class=st>The</span> youth [who] is <span class=st>the</span>
break in a context, <span class=st>the</span> trenchant, Nietzschean prophetic
word, without status in being. &nbsp;Yet it is not arbitrary, <span class=st>for</span>
it has come from sincerity, that is, from responsibility <span class=st>for</span>
<span class=st>the</span> other.&quot;<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[33]</span></span></span></a> 
Breaking away from the weight of the past, we the kids, the broken kids, and
all of us as broken subjectivities, are created anew each moment unto a world
that we did not create, unto a world already broken.  Don’t look at us: it’s
not our fault, the world is not our property, we don’t own it, we’re not the
one’s who broke it; and thank you very much -- thanks for nothing -- because it
looks like we the kids are the ones who have to fix it now.</p>

P 147 This remark already indicates that Levinas’s central problematic in his
second major book <i>Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence </i>is how to
conceive of the subjectivity of youth, of how to reconfigure his earlier

indicates a radical affiliation, but this is not yet the time to explicate it.</p>

“While we recognize in Judaism as in certain aspirations of the left  …. defender
of a the human person we cannot identify destiny of Judaism with destiny of
proletarian … not just a social cause …. Revolution be fatal to Judaism, death
of Judaism in revolutionary man … more delicate values than those at disposal
of socialism.”  Nevertheless, we consider it important to read along this
fissure to understand the mutual implications of Levinas and radical politics.</p>
