“Becoming” otherwise than Heraclitus
*                 (4) Identity of the speaker is always already a response and a responsibility
*         k) Becoming/Temporality shatters identity but precisely in a non-violent way
*                 (1) Starts with Cratylus, not Heraclitus
*                     (a) Cratylus contra Heraclitus the resistance to every integration expressed by the image of the river, in which, according to Heraclitus, one does not bathe twice, and according to Cratylus, not even once.
*                     (b) Sensation breaks up every system; Hegel places at the origin of his dialectic the sensed, and not the unity of sensing and sensed in sensation. It is not by chance that in the Theaetetus* Protagoras’s and Heraclitus’s theses are brought together, as though the singularity of the sentient would be required for Parmedidean being to be able to be pulverized into becoming and to unfold otherwise than as an objective flux of things. A multiplicity of sentients would be the very mode in which a becoming is possible—a becoming in which thought would not simply find again, now in movement, a being subject to a universal law, producing unity. Only in this way does becoming acquire the value of an idea radically opposed to the idea of being, does it designate the resistance to every integration expressed by the image of the river, in which, according to Heraclitus, one does not bathe twice, and according to Cratylus, not even once. A notion of becoming destructive of Parmenidean monism is acquired only through the singu­larity of sensation.
