# CHAPTER TEN A guide for exceptional guttersnipes:
1. Here we can explore “exception” in Pataphysical and Levinasian terms
2. Also explore De L’evasion (Levinas) and Crimethinc EVASION
3. Politics of Drop Out Gutterpunkism/Hakim Bey TAZ/Gone to Croatan
4. Quote Mark Laskey:  Why the hell are we out here getting arrested?  For the kids, man, for the kids.
5. Include Levinas: FOR THE KIDS!!!, which is a paper that compares Levinas’s pro-Marxist pro-68 writings such as “Judaism and Revolution” with the writings of Raoul Vaneigem.
6.  Update this with reflections on the ethical importance of contemporary struggles.  Perhaps just lean heavily on what Critchley has already written in “Infinitely Demanding”

Great news for Simon Critchley!

The section for him is entitled "We Puke In Your General Direction"

Starts off with these two zingers:
“The state of nausea that precedes vomiting, and from which vomiting will deliver us, encloses us on all sides.  we are revolted from the inside; our depths smother beneath ourselves; even our hearts are sick -- Emmanuel Levinas, 1935, “

“ People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints, such people have a corpse in their mouth. -- Raoul Vaneigem, 1967 “

Inspect the motif of "orality" as a metaphor for social connection -- in speech, laughter, breathing, spitting and vommiting"

Discusses Critchley's "Infinitely Demanding" in conjunction with  my paper on Vaneigem and Levinas, Levinas: FOR THE KIDS!!! ( https://www.waste.org/~roadrunner/writing/Levinas/Levinas_FTK_Paper_WEB.htm  )

Bella Ciao!**
