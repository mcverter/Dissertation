to understand needs requires that they be placed in a political context. Only in a democratic process where recipients are taken seriously, rather than being automatically delegitimized because they are needy, can needs be evaluated consistent with an ethic of care. 29 On the other hand, if needs are understood too concretely, other problems arise. We might, for example, be too attentive to our own caring needs and insufficiently attentive to others' needs. Nor is this problem restricted to the individual level. The wealthy are able to command a much greater percentage of the world's resources; this fact does not change if we introduce a vocabulary of needs. Amartya Sen's "small mercies" critique of utilitarianism can, after all, also stand as a critique ,· of a culturally specific theory of needs.-'0 If Western standards of sanitation, dietetic diversity, etc., constitute "needs" in the West, but not elsewhere, then cannot Westerners continue to justify the inequitable distribution of resources in the world? And might not the "small mercies," the satisfactions that keep them barely above survival, suffice to meet the needs of people in cultures where that is all that most people may hope for? r39

The costs, benefits, and risks of altruistic commitments should be fairly shared. The feminist compass points toward an intersectional political economy that highlights dynamics of cooperation and conflict, applying an interdisciplinary vocabulary influenced, but not dictated by the Marxian theory of historical materialism.

Value implies comparison. One can compare the value of two commodities in terms of their worth in money; here, one can establish proportions: i.e., five loaves of bread are worth the same as one steak-frites. Or, one can compare two valuables in Gregory’s gift economies in terms of their rank. But Gregory’s formula does not really explain the workings of gift economies.

water; in fact, if one steps in the same river twice, the water flowing through it is likely to be entirely different. What endures over time is simply the pattern of its flow.[47] Parmenides on the other hand took precisely the opposite view: he held that it was change that was illusion.

There is a level of reality, perhaps one that we humans can never fully perceive, at which forms are fixed and perfect.

All things depend on the power of God. For things to be able to be otherwise than as they are, God’s will, too, would necessarily have to be different. But God’s will cannot be different (as we have just shown most clearly from the consideration of God’s perfection). Therefore, neither can things be different. I admit that this view which subjects everything to some kind of indifferent will of God and asserts that everything depends on his pleasure diverges less from the truth than the view of those who hold that God does everything with the good in mind. For these people seem to posit something external to God that does not depend upon him, to which in acting God looks as if it were a model, or to which he aims, as if it were a fixed target.

The mechanistic approach to nature is as fundamental to the twentieth-century revolution in physics as it was to classical Newtonian science, culminating in the nineteenth-century unification of mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetic theory. Twentieth-century physics still views the world in terms of fundamental particles—electrons, protons, neutrons, mesons, muons, pions, taus, thetas, sigmas, pis, and so on. The search for the ultimate unifying particle, the quark, continues to engage the efforts of the best theoretical physicists.

Mathematical formalism isolates the elements of a given quantum mechanical problem, places them in a latticelike matrix, and rearranges them through a mathematical function called an operator. Systems theory extracts possibly relevant information bits from the environmental context and stores them in a computer memory for later use. But since it cannot store an infinite number of “facts,” it must select a finite number of potentially relevant pieces of data according to a theory or set of rules governing the selection process. For any given solution, this mechanistic approach very likely excludes some potentially relevant factors.

Yet the formalism of the calculus of probabilities excludes the possibility of mathematizing the gestalt—that is, the ways in which each part at any given instant take their meaning from the whole. The more open, adaptive, organic, and complex the system, the less successful is the formalism.

The most important example of holism today is provided by the science of ecology. Although ecology is a relatively new science, its philosophy of nature, holism, is not. Historically, holistic presuppositions about nature have been assumed by communities of people who have succeeded in living in equilibrium with their environments.

The idea of cyclical processes, of the interconnectedness of all things, and the assumption that nature is active and alive are fundamental to the history of human thought. No element of an interlocking cycle can be removed without the collapse of the cycle. The parts themselves thus take their meaning from the whole. Each particular part is defined by and dependent on the total context.

As I confront ideas about nation-building and/or trying to use or reform state power, I ultimately want to encourage others to take abolition and apply it to borders, nations, and states. I see the “nation on no map” as a group of people using skills others may struggle to recognize to develop new thinking, new language, and new societies. I envision a nation that doesn’t need to be a nation and that doesn’t need to be on a map, because it knows borders, states, and boundaries cannot accommodate the complexity of our struggles.

Not surprisingly, men tend to murder people they are not related to. But when women cause someone else’s death (through sins of omission as well as commission) that person is most likely to be her own newborn baby. 8 In this respect, women are utterly different from other primates that, like us, produce one baby at a time.

Yet there is no evidence that mothers usc such information to discriminate among their offspring. They never withhold care on the basis if physical attributes like sex, age, 12 or poor health. Their willingness to care is not affected by infant quality. In this respect, nonhuman primate mothers differ markedly from many human ones. This is not to say that no monkey or ape ever abandons an offspring. Under extreme circumstances they do so. But abandonment depends on the mother’s condition or social situation, rather than attributes of the infant itself. The circumstances are as revealing as they are unusual.

My question, then, is: What happened in the course of human evolution and history to make mothers in our own species so much more discriminating than other primates? No other primate, ever, scrutinizes an infant for defects, or buries a newborn alive because it is horn the “wrong” sex. Does our extremely contingent nature of maternal commitment mean that human mothers arc born with less developed instincts, with blanker slates in this regard than other primates?

The singularity and costliness of each birth is what makes the contingent nature of maternal commitment among human mothers so especially curious. Yet there is an enormous amount of evidence (reviewed below, in chapters i 2 through 14) that not all women do anything like commit unconditionally to each baby they bear. The fact that some human mothers give or withhold care depending on the infant's sex, or some other specific attribute, is unexpected and curious not because mammalian mothers arc

Cercopithecine societies are composed of ranked matrilineal clans, with each clan in turn organized into a rigid female hierarchy. It is mothers and grandmothers who shape it, by perpetually monitoring the competition. Matrilineal clans stick together, rallying to suppress or exclude social-climbing daughters of lower-ranking lineages, while orchestrating advantageous social positions for their own, exercising all the tribal “discipline of a small society,” as Edith Wharton termed the social hierarchies

Now the Greek word συµεηκς, ‘accident’, derives from the verb συµα νειν which means at the same time to follow from, to ensure and to arrive, to happen. Thereby it can designate continuation in both senses of the word, as consequence, that is, ‘what follows’ in the logical sense, and as event, that is, ‘what follows’ in a chronological sense.Self-determination is thus the relation of substance to that which happens. Following this line of thought we understand the ‘future’ in the philosophy of Hegel as the relation which subjectivity maintains with the accidental

By claiming, in the Remark to §258: ‘Time is the same principle as the I = I of pure self-consciousness (das selbe Prinzip als das Ich = Ich)’, Hegel absorbs the conclusions of Kant’s analysis and recalls the identity of the ‘cogito’ and time itself. This identity of time and the ‘cogito’ cannot be reduced to a continuum of instants; rather it appears as a synthetic unity, that is as a ‘seeing of (what is) coming’

Hence the edge to the feminist query raised by philosopher Elisabeth Badinter in Mother Love: Myth and Reality. If such a thing as maternal instinct exists, how could so many thousands of mothers be so unfeeling as to ship their newborns off to be suckled by an unknown woman? “Discretionary” Distancing Twentieth-century debates over the existence of maternal instinct focused on such “discretionary” delegation of care. It was not the desperate mothers, who arguably had no choice, that attracted notice, but the bourgeois mothers who presumably could afford to keep their babies near them—and yet did not. Greuze’s painting of the farewell kiss (figure 14.1) shows what went on outside the house. In large French cities, a middleman, called a meneur, would pick up the newborn. What happened inside the home, or inside people’s heads, was less clear. An account by an eighteenth-century Frenchwoman—a disciple of Rousseau—offers a glimpse. The writer, Jeanne-Marie

Every human mother's response to her infant is influenced by a composite of biological responses of mammalian, primate, and human origin. These include endocrinal priming during pregnancy; physical changes (including changes in the brain) during and after birth; the complex feedback loops of lactation; and the cognitive mechanisms that enhance the likelihood of recognizing and learning to prefer kin.

By endowing human infants with a long mother-centered primate heritage, by envisioning infants with special needs and mothers as creatures especially designed to satisfy them, and by situating an infant’s sense of security and self in the availability of this specially equipped mother, evolutionists like Bowlby and Trivers appeared to be imposing on women painful choices no man need ever make: her aspirations versus her infant’s well-being; vocation or reproduction.Twenty years later, I still return to this topic with trepidation.

Dialectical materialism takes as its fundamental postulate the need to eat: M arx has transformed this very simple fact of biological necessity into the breeding ground of a theoretical system of enormous vitality and explanatory utility, in which productive labour remakes our consciousness, our needs and our world.

The simple sex act has been transformed by the clinical genius of Freud into a theoretical a priori of a system in which libido shapes our consciousness and our world. Death has haunted the male philosophical imagination since Man the Thinker first glimmered into action, and in our own time has become the stark reality which preoccupies existentialism, an untidy and passionately pessimistic body of thought in which lonely and heroic man attempts to defy the absurdity of the void which houses his consciousness and his world.

The ethical essence of the family lies in the dependence of infants, which makes the first demand on people to think of the welfare of another rather than only on personal survival. It is because of this demand that women can add to their limited rational capacity a limited moral understanding. Women care for their children, just as they keep green the memory of ancestors. The family is the sole source and appropriate realm of female ethical being.6 Female morality, like women themselves, remains particular, and relates only to the individuals in the family, concentrating on biological life. It is because female

Second, there is a problem with the notion of the child “breaking free” into the world. Third, there are unresolved ambiguities in Hegel’s notion of the relation of the continuity of the race, which I shall call “genetic continuity,” and the actual course of human history.

The political community is here when we are born and remains when we die. Certainly, it may change its spots once in a while, but the perceived need for stability over time and for regulation of both property relations and the social relations of reproduction all require a political-legal context which mere genetic continuity evidently could

reproduction. Freud, after his impressive insight into the relation of the structure of individual consciousness and alimentary dialectics, turns his attention less successfully to the question of the childhood of the race (182-207). He wants to argue that psychic structure is a response to both individual and collective experience, and he looks rather yearningly on the romantic notion of some kind of subconscious ancestral memory. Freud’s primitive man is, as it were, an adult child and, being romantic, he not only disregards productive activity, but has no reproductive consciousness either.13 He is concerned with his sexuality, a sexuality related to reproduction only in a regressive way: this man is preoccupied with his parents and his brothers, the existing kin, and thinks not one whit of his own progeny. The significance of male/ female opposition is seen by Freud to rest on sexual antagonisms between men, rather than in reproductive relations. The truth is, of
