## PRIMARY CLAIMS

1. The standard dogmatic interpretation of Levinas as a moralist is inaccurate and falls easy prey to the Nietzcshean accusation that “we are lied to by morality.”
2. Contemporary anarchism has relied too much on militaristic language and concepts, especially those inherited from a lineage stretching from Heraclitus through Nietzsche and on to Deleuze. It would be enriched by adopting the ethical insights of Levinas and Kropotkin

## ABSTRACT

In this work, I intend to propose a radical reading of Levinas and a revised model for anarchism. I will do so by by reading the thought of Levinas in conversation with a set of interlocutors, gradually building up a model for radical engagement along the way. Whereas much secondary literature on Levinas focuses primarily on Heidegger, I will be largely skipping this overdetermined discussion in favor of juxtaposing it to the "Heraclitian tradition", from Heraclitus through Nietzsche through Heidegger and Deleuze/Foucault, claiming that Levinas's thought is more fruitfully analyzed in eference to the ontology of Becoming than to that of Being. To draw out additional dimensions of ethical Becoming, Levinas's thought will be read alongside the ideas of non-selfhood and dependent co-origination from [Nagarjuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna) and later Mahayana Buddhists as well as Alfred Jarry's absurdist conception of ['pataphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Pataphysics), the Divine Androgyne of the Sciences, as the "science of exceptions." 

I will explore the aesthetic of 'pataphysics as  [_wabi-sabi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi), the recognition of beauty in and through the faultlines of breakage.  This will be related to the common Buddhist recognition that _samsara_ is always/already _nirvana_.  The Jewish aspect with be explored with an engagement with [Lurianic Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurianic_Kabbalah).  Against orthodox Lurianists who work towards [_tiqqun olam_ -- repair of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam), we will instead interpret alongside the Jewish apostate [Sabbatai Zevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi).  We will celebrate  [ the shattering of the vessels, _Shevirat HaKelim_,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohu_and_Tikun) and find The Community of Those Who Have Nothing In Common among the shards.  Indeed, we will insist upon further iconclasm, even more smashing of idols and destruction of idolatry, preceding not through violence but through the inversion, perversion and subversion of apostasy.

To counteract the mystification that often attaches itself to Levinas's description of his work as "metaphysics", the "everydayness" of ethical-phenomenological exceptions will be illustrated by concrete, material examples. For example, one's continuous yet disruptive relationship to one's Self-as-Other over time will be discussed in terms of trying to find a belt, and the diachronous ethical responsibility of the Self to the Other person will be discussed in terms of the discontinuous and iterative exigencies of digital messaging.

The work will begin by considering a set of methodological questions: what is my own identity as a questioner and what sort of questioning will I undertake? My analysis will endeavor to engage the history of thinking in a critical but nonviolent manner. The critical question in this, of course what extent critique, "kritein"(1), is already violence, is already a cutting or de-cide-ing. The first matter to be considered, therefore, will be the habit of using militaristic language within the philosophical conversation, from the conception of the _agora_ as a site of discursive struggle to the contemporary academic fantasy of philosophy as a competitive argument between various schools of thought. Is it possible to write in the book of the family of dead philosophers always as eulogy? After this, I will propose to read Levinas through his usage of metaphors or tropes(2) by appealing to secondary literature on the nature of metaphors.

The first family of metaphors I will consider will be those of militarism. Nietzsche's description of Truth as an "army of metaphors" not only raises the question of how metaphors constitute the field of philosophy, but also illustrate the way that the metaphor of militarism seizes territory within this field. This analysis will lead into an investigation of Heraclitus and the philosophical traditions that flow from his fragments, including with Heraclitus' understanding of Becoming as _polemos_ (struggle), Nietzsche's description of the perspectival Will-to-Power as foundational for human existence, Foucault's description of all social relationship as expressions of immanent power relations, and Deleuze's recommendation of "the War Machine" as a revolutionary form.

Levinas replaces these metaphors of war with tropes of the family, demonstrating how the dynamic of becoming emerges not from the clash of forces but from the be-cumming, the cumming/coming of being, the copula of copulation, the generation of genderered generations. After addressing the criticisms of Levinas's family scene leveled by Simon Critchley and others, I will propose a Jewish heretical (_Sabatean_) reading of Levinas that perverts inverts and subverts the heteronormativity of his language.

Having sanctified these familial tropes by corrupting them, I will then explore Levinas's discussion of ethics as "maternal" by reevaluating the Aristotelian conceptions of materiality (_hyle_) and _oikonomos_. Exposing these patriarchal biases gives us leverage to invert subvert and pervert the way Aristotle considers the relationship between the political and the social, allowing us to claim that the central question for political economy is consumption rather than production; and that the equitable satisfaction of human needs should take priority in the work of social justice. The last chapters further explore the trope of "family" in Levinas.

By supplanting Heraclitean Becoming with familial tropes of continuous creation, Levinas intends "family" to be understood as "re-ligare", the mode in which persons are ethically bound to each other even before the emergence of the social or the political. We will expand upon this idea of pre-original ethical commitment and consider concrete alternatives to the nuclear family, such as the Juggalo family of horror-rap enthusiasts and queer families such as the Radical Faeries. The work will conclude with a final chapter that considers the implication of these analyses for activism, reading Levinas alongside the situationists and the revolutionists of 1968, the analyses provided by Simon Critchley in “Infinitely Demanding”, and the writings of authors such as Deva Woodly, Kin Tallbear, Loree Erickson, and Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha who understand care as the proper engine for mobilization.

Many of these ideas have been fleshed out in previous writings.

(1) Etymoline: formerly critick, 1580s, "one who passes judgment, person skilled in judging merit in some particular class of things," from Middle French critique (14c.), from Latin criticus "a judge, a censor, an estimator," also "grammarian who detects spurious passages in literary work," from Greek kritikos "able to make judgments," from krinein "to separate, decide" (from PIE root \*krei- "to sieve," thus "discriminate, distinguish"). The meaning "one who judges merits of books, plays, etc." is from c. 1600. The English word always has had overtones of "censurer, faultfinder, one who judges severely."

(2) I need to observe more closely where and how Levinas uses these two terms. They each have a technical meaning in Levinas's system of wordplay which can be understood by examining their etymological roots: (1) "Metaphor", "carrying over" signal moments of phenomenological "giving birth" (2) "trope", turning, to describe the inversion of this child into a newly created Other/Self.  
"Or do the being encumbered with oneself and the suffering of constriction in one’s skin, BETTER than METAPHORS, follow the exact TROPE of an alteration of essence, which inverts, or would invert, into a recurrence in which the expulsion of self outside of itself is its substitu­tion."
