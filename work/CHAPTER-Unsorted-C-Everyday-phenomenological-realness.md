# Everyday phenomenological realness

* perhaps a continuation of ‘pataphysics.
* "Exception" as miraculous reality of the everyday

Ethics/responsibility is constitutive of our existence as such.  It is not an exceptional event that occurs in certain situations – or rather all situations are exceptional events (this is ‘pataphysics.  Maybe it belongs in the ‘pataphysical section?)

Make sure throughout to highlight the everydayness of the ethical.  Derrida draws attention to the rich details of Levinas’s descriptions but this is often overlooked.  So far, we have two examples which are in the notes below

## self-identity as temporal trace
Q:  Where is my belt?  A:  It’s not in the closet where it’s supposed to be; it’s on yesterday’s pants.  This is about how we inherit the traces of our past selves-as-others in the present and leave traces for future selves-and-others.  Read Levinas’s work on the Trace (featuring Sherlock Holmes!) for more description

## digital responsiblity
NU FONE – WHO DIS???  Explores ethical connection of responsibility in our everyday experiences of digital communication; the clarion call of the cellular tone, that one is obligated to respond even if one does not write back; discuss the anxious periodicity of repeatedly checking messages to see if online dating connection has written back, as well as the stress in writing back.  There is even a “3 day rule” – you aren’t “supposed” to write back for 3 days say the “pick-up artists”.  

## digital identity
Explore digital identity in this context of responsibility.  Our Levinasian exploration of ethical digital identity with a discussion of the Turing Test, in which intelligence is measured by the probability that the interlocutor is a human and not a robot.  This is exactly why computer scientists have authorization protocols (OAuth), why you have a reusable Google or Facebook identity, why you have to prove you are not a robot, etc.

## BUDDHIST MEDITATION
Deferral of response as the ethical engagement of Buddhist meditation. Meditation/anapanasati/sati teaches you that you do not have to react right away, that responses can be deferred
