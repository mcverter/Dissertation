* 1. wabi sabi is aesthetic of the 'pataphysical
* 2. 
*    1. But most of the time, we rely on each other, for like everything. For everything we take for granted, like when you let an old lady go in front of you in the checkout line to when you break down on the side of the road and somebody stops to help you out. Most of the time, people help each other out. Most of the time, people help complete strangers out, no matter their race or religion or gender or whatever.
*    2. The problem, however, is there are times when people act with malice and deliberately hurt each other. What do we do in those situations? Do we rely on police and the military or do we learn to take care of our communities and of each other?
* 3. the world as it is, in its fragments is already redeemed.  no need as susan handleman to restore or reunite the fragments.  the secrets of the sabatieanism.  not to restore the shattered lurianic vessel but to preserve it in its fragments.  "Samsara is already nirvana; world is already redeemed."  Check Susan Handelman "Fragments of Redemption" for her reading of Lurianic Tiqqun
* 4. Barbarianism (incompatibility of speech) vs Babar the elephant.
*    1. Incompatibility of speech = violence?
*    2. But also the freak is the barbarian
*    3. The dangerous stranger at the beginning of Aristotle Politics, man without a state
*    4.  ama birch.  Ferguson writings.  I was also trying to figure out why she was reluctant to say it. I mean, she stated why: "People will think i am crazy"  But everyone knows that prophets are tricksters too and often perceived as crazy. But everyone also knows that homeless people as well as queers and freaks and persons of the African diaspora are always put down as "crazy" too. Plus why is being "crazy" a bad thing anyways -- what assumptions are we already making about consciousness and how are we already stigmatizing certain forms of intelligence. Lots and lots of layers to this one
*    5.  Barbarian is both the nietzshche's madman or prophet, heidegger is in this mold.  
*    6.  derrida does it right with his double reading that shows everything is itself and it opposite
*        1.  barbarian as ambiguous outside to language
*        2.  violence of language
*    7.  Barbarian as ambiguity of violence
*    8. Barbar the elephant  Buddhist ears.  Ganesha
*    9.  the barbarian is the exception

* 
* barbarian (adj.)
* mid-14c., "foreign, of another nation or culture," from Medieval Latin barbarinus (see barbarian (n.)). Meaning "of or pertaining to savages, rude, uncivilized" is from 1590s.
* 
* barbarian (n.)
* 
* early 15c., in reference to classical history, "a non-Roman or non-Greek," earlier barbar (late 14c.) "non-Roman or non-Greek person; non-Christian; person speaking a language different from one's own," from Medieval Latin barbarinus (source of Old French barbarin "Berber, pagan, Saracen, barbarian"), from Latin barbarus "strange, foreign, barbarous," from Greek barbaros "foreign, strange; ignorant," from PIE root *barbar- echoic of unintelligible speech of foreigners (compare Sanskrit barbara- "stammering," also "non-Aryan," Latin balbus "stammering," Czech blblati "to stammer").
* 
* Greek barbaroi (plural noun) meant "all that are not Greek," but especially the Medes and Persians; originally it was not entirely pejorative, but its sense became moreso after the Persian wars. The Romans (technically themselves barbaroi) took up the word and applied it to tribes or nations which had no Greek or Roman accomplishments.
* 
* Also in Middle English (c. 1400) "native of the Barbary coast;" meaning "rude, wild person" is from 1610s. Occasionally in 19c. English distinguished from savage (n.) as being a step closer to civilization. Sometimes, in reference to Renaissance Italy, "a non-Italian." It also was used to translate the usual Chinese word of contempt for foreigners.
* 
* Barbarian applies to whatever pertains to the life of an uncivilized people, without special reference to its moral aspects. Barbarous properly expresses the bad side of barbarian life and character, especially its inhumanity or cruelty: as, a barbarous act. Barbaric expresses the characteristic love of barbarians for adornment, magnificence, noise, etc., but it is not commonly applied to persons: it implies the lack of cultivated taste .... [Century Dictionary, 1889]

*     1.  This is irrefutable proof a 'pataphysical dimension intersecting our own at all possible tangents. Would you agree, M
* 6.  Indigenous
* 
*  I really dislike this question. The question is based on the idea that the original occupants of a place are its rightful owners, which is in turn based on ideas in English Common Law regarding property ownership. As an anarchist, I refuse to recognize any claim of ownership and any idea of provate property.
* If you talk to indigenous folks they do not conceive of their relation to land in terms of ownership; I have never said an indigenous person say "My people belongs here -- your people does not".
* In fact, the whole idea of Tribes and Nations as the Sovereign Owners of a land is based on colonialism -- it comes, at least in part, from the Treaties signed with colonial powers. In these treaties, US governments decided to "recognize" a particular subgroup of people living on the land that they could sign a treaty with and thereby bargain away their land.
* That is, the idea of tribal possession is actually founded on a strategy of dispossession of colonial powers
* 
* 
* Willa Rascal Interesting. I see your point, but look at it differently. I understood the question as, who knew the land before you? And as a homage and a recognition to those that came before. If history is not fully recognized it is hard to imagine a complete and truthful future. I don’t believe in the rights of ownership either, to me this question asked,and inferred, who were the stewards of place before, and are you being one now?

* The Mexican people are fit for communism
* The inhabitants of the State of Morelos, as well as those of the South of Puebla, Michoacán, Durango, Jalisco, Yucatan and other States, in which vast territorial extensions have been invaded by proletarian multitudes who have dedicated themselves to cultivating them, demonstrate to the world whole, with facts, that you don't need a society of wise men to solve the problem of hunger.
* In order to arrive at the practical result of the taking of possession of the land and the instruments of work in Mexico, leaders, "friends" of the working class, have not been needed, nor have "paternal decrees", "wise laws" been necessary. Or anything like that. The action has done it and is doing it all. Mexico is moving towards communism faster than we expected the most exalted revolutionaries and the government and the bourgeoisie are now not knowing what to do in the presence of events that they believed were still far from being carried out.
* It is not yet three months ago that Juan Sarabia, in an extensive and annoying open letter addressed to me and which was published by almost all the bourgeois press in Mexico, told me that the working class did not understand what we preach and that the people were satisfied with the conquest of the Madero revolt: the ballot. The facts show that we are not delusional liberals and that we fight convinced that our action and our propaganda respond to the needs and the way of thinking of the poor class of Mexico.
* The Mexican people instinctively hate the Authority and the bourgeoisie. Everyone who has lived in Mexico will have made sure that there is no individual more cordially hated than the gendarme; that the word government fills ordinary people with concern, that the soldier, everywhere admired and applauded, is viewed with dislike and contempt, that every person who does not earn a living by the work of his hands is hated.
* This is already more than enough for an economic and anti-authoritarian social revolution; but there is more. About four million Indians live in Mexico, who until twenty or twenty-five years ago lived in communities, having in common the lands, the waters and the forests. Mutual support was the norm in those communities, where the Authority was only felt when the agent of the revenue collection made its periodic appearance or when the rural people came looking for men to force them into the Army. In these communities there were no judges, no mayors, no jailers, and no such moth. Everyone had the right to land, water for irrigation, forest for firewood and wood to build the jacales. The plows went from hand to hand, as did the yoke of oxen. Each family worked the extension of land that they calculated to be enough to produce what was necessary, and the work of weeding and raising the crops was done in common, the whole community meeting today to raise Pedro's harvest, tomorrow to raise that of Juan and so on. To make a jackal, all the members of the community put to work.
* These simple customs lasted until the Authority, for the complete pacification of the country, was able to guarantee the prosperity of its businesses to the bourgeoisie. The generals of the political revolts received large tracts of land; the landowners widened the limits of their fiefs; the vilest politicastros obtained immense lands as wastelands, and the foreign adventurers obtained concessions of lands, forests, waters, everything, in short, leaving our Indian brothers without a span of land, without the right to take from the forest or the smallest branch from a tree, in the most abject misery, stripped of all that was theirs.
* As for the mestizo population, which is the one that forms the majority of the inhabitants of the Mexican Republic, with the exception of that which inhabited large cities and towns of some importance, it also had communal lands, forests and free waters, which same as the indigenous population. Mutual support was equally the rule; the houses were made in common; currency was hardly necessary, because there was an exchange of products; but peace was made, the Authority was strengthened, and the bandits of politics and money shamelessly stole the land, the forests, everything. Not even four years ago, it could still be seen in the opposition newspapers that the American X, or the German Y or the Spanish Z had locked up an entire population within the limits of “their” property with the help of the Authority.
* It is seen, then, that the Mexican people are apt to reach communism, because they have practiced it, at least in part, for centuries, and that explains why, even though most of them are illiterate, they understand that better than taking part in electoral farces to raise executioners, it is preferable to take possession of the land, and it is taking it with great scandal from the bourgeois thief.
* Now, all that remains is for the worker to take possession of the factory, the workshop, the mine, the foundry, the railroad, the ship, everything in a word; that no masters of any kind be recognized and that will be the end of the present movement.
* Go ahead, comrades!

* 
* I  also write against the terms "indigenous" and "native" from a Levinasian perspective.
* These are already terrible words: both "gen" in indigenous and "nat" in native seem to refer to birthright. There is definitely an alternative/Levinasian reading of these terms, but they are most commonly understood as some sort of blood link with the land.
* Here is what I wrote before.

* I strongly dislike this question [of "whose lands are you on"]. The question is based on the idea that the original occupants of a place are its rightful owners, which is in turn based on ideas in English Common Law regarding property ownership.

* 8.  Nagarujuna Mahadyamika
* 9.  The fantasy of “Ego Death”, Atman=Brahman, etc is Authoritarian. It is the void around which the fascist imaginary spins
* No. It isn’t. It is a fascist liberation. One has to first understand how fascism is experienced as a liberation. But a liberation to what? If it is a liberation unto the Absolute or the Void, then it is probably fascist Vincent De
* It isn’t the technolocratic manipulation: the fantasy of Absolute and Void are always/already fascist. They reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Emptiness. I blame Schopenhauer for this duck up. Acácia Xylária
* Acácia Xylária like Lin Chi hits his students with a stick? But remember the commentary of Pu Hua: HEEHAW HEEHAW!!!
* Pu Hua is OG 'pataphysician
* However I associate the term “dharma” most closely with the Bhavad Gita, which is mos def mos def a favorite text for fascists. Peter Golightly
* Callum Milburn My argument, though, is that the fantasy of yogic unity proposed by the Bhavad Gita, the Yogacaras and the Upanishads is always/already authoritarian.
* 
* Callum Milburn strongly dislike nietzsche but respect him greatly. Martin Headgear is a complete putz, though.
* The figure of the guru or the all knowing sage is also part of the Authoritarian tradition. It is perhaps the clearest example of literal Authorship. Thanks for the reminder Peter Golightly

* "A Levinasian critique of technology would require a meditation on The Turing Test, in which artificial intelligence is assessed by whether a computer’s responses seem human to its interlocutor. In what way does an Other person’s freedom to respond forever transcends the programming of any automated network?"

* Mitchell Verter
* "[82] Indeed, Levinas’ phenomenology of conversation can be most clearly observed in an internet chat room, in which one party makes a statement, forever etched in memory, but retains the possibility to write something new. At each instant, the interlocutor, the Other detached by millions of miles of fiber optic cable, always retains the freedom to respond in ways that can not be anticipated. Indeed, a Levinasian critique of technology would require a meditation on Alan Turing’s famous test of computer intelligence: in what ways does an Other person’s freedom to respond, capacity to surprise, forever transcend the programming of any automated network.

*             i) Elevations and Subversion
*             ii) As distressing as it can be when anger is directed against a thinker one admires, it seems even worse when someone defends his thought with hostility and even employs it as a weapon of attack.  As writers who have taken responsibility for the thought of Emmanuel Levinas, we have already committed to responding to the protest that his writings have engendered.  For this reason, it seems inappropriate for Richard A. Cohen to dismiss the feminist analysis of Tina Chanter’s “Antigone’s Dilemma” with so much brutality and condescension in his first book Elevations, characterizing her thoughtful and temperate article as “a hatchet job.  Levinas is once more made to play the tired role of the male fall guy … So why even bother with Levinas, one wonders, that sophisticated intellectual male chauvinist pig?” (EHG 196)  It is hard for me to understand how a scholar of Levinas--a philosopher of politeness if nothing else--could be so rude and patronizing to one of our sisters.  However, Cohen dismisses Levinas’s critical questioners--feminist and otherwise--as “attackers” (EHG 195) none of whom is given the individuated respect for separated Otherness, but who are instead defined collectively as enemies who “demonstrate loyalty to a party or school.” (EHG 196)
*             iii) Elevations opens upon an ominous note. Cohen recounts, “I remember distinctly to this day the impression Levinas made on me. 'This is true', I thought, in contrast to all the philosophers and philosophies which are fascinating or provocative” (EHG xi). Although anyone who has read Levinas can certainly appreciate Cohen’s “naïve” (EHG xi) sense of wonder, Cohen makes the dangerous move of proclaiming Levinas’s thought to be “true,” momentarily overlooking Levinas’s crucial “elevation” of the Good over the True.  Practically canonizing Levinas as a saint or prophet, such an orthodox  interpretation verges on dogmatism.  We can already hear in Cohen’s contempt for thinkers who are merely “fascinating or provocative” an effort to reduce the ethical height of Levinas’s phenomenological ethics to a belligerent morality of ressentiment.
*             iv) Although Cohen is an astute phenomenologist, he makes the mistake of placing the normative over the phenomenological without fully appreciating how Levinas’s phenomenology is already ethics.  Cohen states that “the central claim in Levinas is that the face of the other is manifested in and manifests a moral height” (EHG 183).  Nevertheless, he reduces Levinas’s thought to a set of moral platitudes:  “It is quite simple:  it is better to be good than anything else.  It is better to help others than to help ourselves” (EEP 11).  Contrary to Cohen’s interpretation, however, Levinas does not issue prescriptive commands, but instead demonstrates how the prescriptive is already embedded in the existential. Levinas’s project is closely akin to Husserl’s quest to determine the eidetic essences that structure experience (Ideas 7-8), and even more similar to Heidegger’s demonstration that our “everydayness” actually reflects a more fundamental ontology (BT 380-82).  That is, Levinas demonstrates how all of our experiences, even the most “commonplace” (TI 53), are already bent eccentrically by our moral orientation towards the Other, already penetrated from the rear by obligation.  For example, Levinas does not simply argue that “violence is bad,” but rather demonstrates that, thanks to the ethical relationship, our wills and our bodies are always exposed to violence (TI 229) yet this violence is always postponed (TI 236).
*             v) Cohen equates Levinas’s motif of height with a “moral force” that justifies hierarchical judgments of “better” and “worse” (EEP 140).  Without properly articulating what the terms “good” and “evil” mean in Levinas’s writing, Cohen expresses this contrast with astonishing violence, arguing that Levinas’s “battle cry would be ‘Against evil, for the good!’” (EEP 104) Such a polemical cry could not possibly come from Levinas, but rather from Nietzsche’s man of ressentiment.  According to Nietzsche, ressentiment arises from two inversions: (a) horizontally, ressentiment, the “sanctification of revenge under the name of justice” (52), looks outwards for an enemy rather than looking inwards for virtue; (b) vertically, ressentiment expresses the hatred of lowly people for the high born, and their jealous effort to revalue moral height.  This attitude of ressentiment is most apparent in Cohen’s description of Levinas as “teaching morality to the intellectual elite who … think themselves too intelligent, too sophisticated, too cultured for ordinary morality” (EEP 1)
*             vi) To avoid confusing Levinas’s moral height with ressentiment, we must oppose the hierarchical logic of dogmatic orthodoxy by becoming subverters, overturning thought from below. [3]  Judaism has always been a religion for subversion, for radical ruptures of thought that express both supreme disobedience and supreme piety. As Susan Handelman claims, Judaism contains within it a “heretic hermeneutic [that] can be part of tradition while simultaneously rebelling against it” (201).  Our first patriarch, Abraham, became such an iconoclast when he smashed the idols revered and sold by his own father.[4]  Similarly, modern Judaism stands in the shadow of Sabbatai Sevi, the 17th century apostate Messiah who consummated the Jewish Law by violating it.[5]
