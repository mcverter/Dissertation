# CHAPTER FIVE Ethical Pataphysics
## (the only way to overthrow Ubu)

I am not entirely sure if this is an independent chapter but it was outlined as such

There are a few reasons why we choose to identify this as project as 'pataphysical.  First of all, it is a parody of Levinas's own thought as "ethical metaphysics".  Alfred Jarry explains 'pataphysics as "the science of that which is superinduced upon metaphysics, whether within or beyond the latter's limitations, extending as far beyond metaphysics as the latter extends beyond physics."  By calling our work "'pataphysical", we intend both to demonstrate our fealty to Levinas's thinking but also to display our own radical supervenience of it.  Furthermore, using the term "'pataphysics" allows us to register our objection with what we take as the conservative reading of Levinas. This dogmatic interpretation fixates on the idea that Levinas's ethical metaphysics is "better" than Heidegger's ontology.  It then interprets the words "better" and "good" in a manner that is too reminiscent of Nietzsche's analysis of moralism as a Will-to-Power, a will to dominate, a violence.  The most significant exponent of this point of view is Richard Cohen, in particular his book "Elevations".  Throughout this book, Cohen rails against Heidegger and presents a sanctimonious version of Levinas's ethics, reducing it to Nietzsche's *ressentiment* and thus fails to properly respond to the Nietzschean question that Levinas poses as the first line of Totality and Infinity "Are we lied to by morality?".  It is unclear to me how popular Cohen's reading and reading like Cohen's are -- these still do seeem to have a significant sway, especially among Jewish chauvinist readers in France and Israel and the USA.  Critchley has expressed his disliked of this conservative reading of Levinas.   

 To counter the violence of this interpretation, I would like to inspect the language of the superlative, of superiority, of priority ("ethics is FIRST philosophy").  My argument is that these words have an underappreciated technical meaning. Most apparently, they are intended to invert the typical philosophical notion of first principles, and in particular a subversion of Heidegger's constant search for the most "primordial" ground of Being.  Describing towards the social relationship as something as something "over" and "above" indicates that neither subjectivity nor generality are primordial.  Furthermore, these words have a technical meaning in the metaphorical economy within Levinas's prose: when he uses these terms, he is indicating an aspect of the Other, such as the creative novelty of the birth of the new Self-as-Other, and the Self's perspectival regard towards the Other within the Other's sovereign subjectivity (or as Levinas calls it "alterity")

I am not entirely sure how deeply to go into an exploration of the 'pataphysical itself.  In part this label is rhetorical, to push Levinas studies in a radical direction, but opening up the 'pataphysical does allow us to explore dimensions that are interesting both for Levinas and for anarchism. Alfred Jarry explains that "'Pataphysics will be, above all, the science of the particular, despite the common opinion that the only science is that of the general. 'Pataphysics will examine the laws governing exceptions, and will explain the universe supplementary to this one.”  The problematic of particularity versus generality has a long history in philosophy that I do not know offhand.  Certainly we can correlate it to Hume's discussion of the inferring a general rule, that the sun always rises, from having observed it in the past; perhaps also Hegel has something interesting to say about Absolute Particularity.  In any case, the language of "exceptionality" is important for Levinas.  Levinas uses the preface "ex" thoughout his work, to describe a mode of escaping the realm of generality, the domination of Being.  In Time and the Other, he describes the self's transformation through time as a process of "excendence" and throughout his later work uses terms like "exception" to refer to the revelation of both the other and the self.  The imporant idea here is that both Self and Other are absolutely unique presences in the fabric of reality, exceptions to the generality of the world.

I would like to expand on the idea of the 'pataphysical exception through a meditation on a few other affiliated concepts.  I would claim that the aesthetics of wabi-sabi both have a Levinasian resonance and illustrate the idea of exceptionality.  Wabi-sabi is the Japanese artistic practice of emphasizing the beauty of the accidental or the broken, for example by sealing a shattered bowl with melted gold, thus emphasizing the beauty of the breakage.  This aspect of the accidental, this appreciation of the breakages, echoes with Levinas's own usage of the term "trauma" to illustrate the constitution of identity.  This appreciation for breakage also resonates with several important spiritual concepts.  First of all, the Buddhist doctrine that *samsara* is *nirvana* means exactly this, that the disparate flux of illusion is already the object of enlightenment.  Secondly I would like to claim that the Sabbatai Sevi's act of Jewish apostasy is exactly his defiance of the Lurianic doctrine of Tiqqun Olam, the repair of the world, an insistance that the world in its fragmentary state is already sanctified. The analysis of the 'pataphysical helps us to understand that how our ordinary and everyday experiences of imperfection are already ethical.  Levinas's entire corpus aims not for holism or perfection but instead a richer understanding of the ethical import of an already broken world.  

Now that this summary is winding up with Sabbatai Sevi, I should mention something that should probably have been stated above, that I intend my own reading to be a radical and iconoclastic reading which is also a faithful one.  Here is a quote from "Levinas, Perverter" that still articulates my basic hermeneutic principle of subversion, perversion and inversion "To avoid confusing Levinas’s moral height with ressentiment, we must oppose the hierarchical logic of dogmatic orthodoxy by becoming subverters, overturning thought from below.   Judaism has always been a religion for subversion, for radical ruptures of thought that express both supreme disobedience and supreme piety. As Susan Handelman claims, Judaism contains within it a “heretic hermeneutic [that] can be part of tradition while simultaneously rebelling against it” (201).  Our first patriarch, Abraham, became such an iconoclast when he smashed the idols revered and sold by his own father.  Similarly, modern Judaism stands in the shadow of Sabbatai Sevi, the 17th century apostate Messiah who consummated the Jewish Law by violating it."
