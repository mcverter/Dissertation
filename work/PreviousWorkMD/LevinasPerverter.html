<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>ABSTRACT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since the inauguration of modern French feminism in Simone
DeBeauvoir’s <i>The Second Sex,</i> Emmanuel Levinas has been criticized for
the way his thought employs gendered, familial tropes.  In response, this paper
argues that, although this does constitute a very real and urgent <i>problematic</i>
in Levinas’s thought, it only becomes a <i>problem</i> when his writing is read
in a hermeneutically &quot;straight&quot; manner.&nbsp; Beneath the apparent
hetero-normative veneer of Levinas's prose lurk traces of queerness.&nbsp; By
closely tracing the motifs that Levinas correlates with gender, this paper will
illustrate how, at each instant in the ethical relationship, the Self is always
transforming between masculine- and feminine-gendered performances for a
feminine- or masculine-gendered Other.&nbsp; Rather than embodying a
conservative and essentialist view of sexuality, Levinas articulates an
existential performative perversity.&nbsp;<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Throughout his work, most evidently in <i>Totality and Infinity</i>,
Levinas employs motifs of kinship to describe my connection with
alterity.&nbsp;  When he describes the world as being &quot;familiar to
us&quot; (<i>TI </i>33), Levinas implies that experience is constituted <i>as</i>
family members.  Through each perspective of the ethical
&quot;relationship&quot; (<i>TI </i>39) opened at each instant of the ethical
genealogy, the Other figures as a different <i>relative</i>: the father of
futural fecundity (<i>TI </i>274-277), the wife of the economic home (<i>TI </i>154-156),
the brother of political fraternity (<i>TI </i>278-280), the sister soul of
incestuous Eros (<i>TI </i>254), and so on.&nbsp;  The prevalence of these
gendered family tropes has led many commentators to criticize Levinas for
having a sexist and heteronormative bias.&nbsp; Over half a century ago in the
foundational work of modern French feminism, <i>The Second Sex,</i> Simone de
Beauvoir accused Levinas's figuration of woman as Other to be &quot;an
assertion of masculine privilege” (xvi n3).  More recently, this protest has
been expressed more angrily, with a recent article claiming that Levinas’s work
articulates a “demonization of femininity and erasure of maternity” (Walsh 97).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>For anyone who admires the work of Levinas, such anger is alarming. 
Rather than reacting <i>against</i> this feminist standpoint, however, it is
precisely our responsibility as Levinas scholars to be awakened by this alarm
and to respond sincerely to this anger.  As Andrea Juno and V. Vale explain,
“[Women’s] anger can spark and re-invigorate; it can bring hope and energy back
into our lives and mobilize politically against the status quo” (5).  Only by
rendering Levinas vulnerable, by exposing him to feminist critique, can we begin
to answer for the problems in his thought and perhaps even to use these
problems to develop new insights into gender and sexuality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>On the one hand, the feminist objection to Levinas’s language seems to be
exactly correct. Without a doubt, Levinas uses gendered motifs throughout his
philosophy, deploying familial structures inherited from <i>both</i> the Judaic
<i>and</i> the Greek legacies of patriarchy.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> 
At all moments of our reading, this should indeed trouble us.  We should always
refrain from masquerading his gendered language by replacing masculine pronouns
with feminine ones, neutral ones, or even the hermaphroditic “he or she”;
perhaps we should cease altogether to use “it” in our translations. We must
keep in mind that Levinas articulates <i>Humanisme de l’autre Homme, </i>“Humanism
of the Other <i>Man</i>,” and not, as a recent translation would have it,
“Humanism of the Other.”  On the other hand, only to claim that Levinas
“privileges” the masculine over the feminine overlooks the more essential
question: what does “privileging” mean and should we necessarily privilege the
privileged over the secondary?   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Derrida astutely poses this methodological problem, “We will attempt to
ask several questions.  If they succeed in approaching the heart of this
explication, they will be nothing less than objections but rather the questions
put to <i>us</i> by Levinas” (<i>WD</i> 84).  Perhaps the words that have
caused so much controversy in Levinas’s work are the very terms that he himself
opens up for discussion?  Perhaps Levinas’s usage of filial tropes is not
merely one of the “problems” in his view of politics (Critchley 174) but rather
a <i>problematic</i> which must be deepened?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>More than any other thinker in the history of Western philosophy, Levinas
stands accused in the very body of his texts, texts that “call for the critique
exercised by <i>another </i>philosopher” (<i>OTB </i>20), texts radically open
to critical readings, texts that constantly require justification.  Exactly
because he employs binary gendered concepts, we can use Levinas’s texts to protest
for justice not just in his work but in philosophy and in Western culture
itself.  Levinas has inherited sexist language and patriarchal logic from a
long tradition of canonical Western thought--most of which has been written by
white males<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[2]</span></span></span></a>--that
has typically figured subjectivity as virility and citizenship as fraternity.
Whereas many sensible, egalitarian thinkers try to masquerade this legacy by
using gender-neutral language, Levinas deliberately foregrounds the problematic
of gender.  Therefore, perhaps a careful and critical reading of his texts can
begin to think through the history of thought as masculine and to respond to
the anger of our sisters.</p>

<p class=CenterHeading style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:200%'><i>Elevations</i>
and Subversion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>As distressing as it can be when anger is directed against a thinker one admires,
it seems even worse when someone defends his thought with hostility and even
employs it as a weapon of attack.  As writers who have taken responsibility for
the thought of Emmanuel Levinas, we have already committed to responding to the
protest that his writings have engendered.  For this reason, it seems
inappropriate for Richard A. Cohen to dismiss the feminist analysis of Tina
Chanter’s “Antigone’s Dilemma” with so much brutality and condescension in his
first book <i>Elevations</i>, characterizing her thoughtful and temperate
article as “a hatchet job.  Levinas is once more made to play the tired role of
the male fall guy … So why even bother with Levinas, one wonders, that
sophisticated intellectual male chauvinist pig?” (<i>EHG </i>196)  It is hard
for me to understand how a scholar of Levinas--a philosopher of politeness if
nothing else--could be so rude and patronizing to one of our sisters.  However,
Cohen dismisses Levinas’s critical questioners--feminist and otherwise--as
“attackers” (<i>EHG </i>195) none of whom is given the individuated respect for
separated Otherness, but who are instead defined collectively as enemies who
“demonstrate loyalty to a party or school.” (<i>EHG </i>196) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'><i>Elevations</i> opens upon an ominous note. Cohen recounts,<i> </i>“I
remember distinctly to this day the impression Levinas made on me. 'This is <i>true</i>',
I thought, in contrast to all the philosophers and philosophies which are <i>fascinating</i>
or <i>provocative</i>” (<i>EHG </i>xi). Although anyone who has read Levinas
can certainly appreciate Cohen’s “naïve” (<i>EHG </i>xi) sense of wonder, Cohen
makes the dangerous move of proclaiming Levinas’s thought to be “<i>true</i>,”
momentarily overlooking Levinas’s crucial “elevation” of the Good over the
True.  Practically canonizing Levinas as a saint or prophet, such an orthodox<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> </span> interpretation verges on dogmatism.  We can
already hear in Cohen’s contempt for thinkers who are merely “<i>fascinating</i>
or <i>provocative</i>” an effort to reduce the ethical height of Levinas’s
phenomenological ethics to a belligerent morality of <i>ressentiment</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Although Cohen is an astute phenomenologist, he makes the mistake of
placing the normative over the phenomenological without fully appreciating how
Levinas’s phenomenology is already ethics.  Cohen states that “the central
claim in Levinas is that the face of the other is manifested in and manifests a
moral height” (<i>EHG </i>183).  Nevertheless, he reduces Levinas’s thought to
a set of moral platitudes:  “It is quite simple:  it is better to be good than
anything else.  It is better to help others than to help ourselves” (<i>EEP </i>11). 
Contrary to Cohen’s interpretation, however, Levinas does not issue
prescriptive commands, but instead demonstrates how the prescriptive is already
embedded in the existential. Levinas’s project is closely akin to Husserl’s
quest to determine the eidetic essences that structure experience (<i>Ideas </i>7-8),
and even more similar to Heidegger’s demonstration that our “everydayness”
actually reflects a more fundamental ontology (<i>BT</i> 380-82).  That is,
Levinas demonstrates how all of our experiences, even the most “commonplace” (<i>TI</i>
53), are already bent eccentrically by our moral orientation towards the Other,
already penetrated from the rear by obligation.  For example, Levinas does not
simply argue that “violence is bad,” but rather demonstrates that, thanks to
the ethical relationship, our wills and our bodies are always exposed to
violence (<i>TI </i>229) yet this violence is always postponed (<i>TI </i>236).
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Cohen equates Levinas’s motif of height with a “moral force” that
justifies hierarchical judgments of “better” and “worse” (<i>EEP</i> 140). 
Without properly articulating what the terms “good” and “evil” mean in
Levinas’s writing, Cohen expresses this contrast with astonishing violence,
arguing that Levinas’s “battle cry would be ‘Against evil, for the good!’” (<i>EEP</i>
104) Such a polemical cry could not possibly come from Levinas, but rather from
Nietzsche’s man of <i>ressentiment.</i>  According to Nietzsche, <i>ressentiment
</i>arises from two inversions: (a) horizontally, <i>ressentiment, </i>the
“sanctification of revenge under the name of justice” (52),<i> </i>looks
outwards for an enemy rather than looking inwards for virtue; (b) vertically, <i>ressentiment</i>
expresses the hatred of lowly people for the high born, and their jealous
effort to revalue moral height.  This attitude of <i>ressentiment</i> is most
apparent in Cohen’s description of Levinas as “teaching morality to the
intellectual elite who … think themselves too intelligent, too sophisticated,
too cultured for ordinary morality” (<i>EEP</i> 1) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>To avoid confusing Levinas’s moral height with<i> ressentiment</i>, we
must oppose the hierarchical logic of dogmatic orthodoxy by becoming
subverters, overturning thought from below.<span class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a

Judaism has always been a religion for subversion, for radical ruptures of
thought that express both supreme disobedience and supreme piety. As Susan
Handelman claims, Judaism contains within it a “heretic hermeneutic [that] can
be part of tradition while simultaneously rebelling against it” (201).  Our
first patriarch, Abraham, became such an iconoclast when he smashed the idols
revered and sold by his own father.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span

Metaphors</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Alongside the violence of critical protest yet against the violence of
rhetorical orthodoxy, we can still embrace the subversive potential of violent
speech by interpreting Levinas blasphemously.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> 
In contrast to Cohen’s hierarchical and orthodox moralism, our subversive and
radical reading will attempt to reveal the immanent roots, the poetic dimension
within Levinas’s hyperbolic, transcendental prose.<a href="#_edn7"

Such a reading will show that, although Levinas deliberately uses filial tropes
throughout his work, this would only constitute a &quot;problem&quot; if it
were read in a hermeneutically &quot;straight&quot; manner.&nbsp; Beneath the
apparent hetero-normative veneer of Levinas's prose lurk traces of
queerness.&nbsp; The ethical relationship is directed not simply from masculine
Self to feminine Other, but is everywhere perverted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>One of the reasons why readings of Levinas have so consistently upheld a
heteronormative analysis is that many interpretations construe his work through
a set of programmatic proclamations.  We often read that Levinas’s philosophy
can summarized as “Ethics is First Philosophy” or “The Other is the Most
High.”  I would argue that, in addition to considering a statement like “ethics
is first philosophy” to be a thematic declaration, we must meditate upon it as
a riddle to be solved.  In order to crack it open, we must think through not
only the metaphysical traditions of <i>prot&#275; philosophia</i> in Aristotle
and <i>prima philosophia</i> in Descartes, but more importantly, what the word
“first” and what Derrida calls “the notion of primacy” (<i>WD</i> 97) mean in a
Levinasian context. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Rather than focusing on the obvious rhetorical gestures Levinas makes, a
radical reading must look carefully at the immanent play of tropes within his
work.  Levinas’s writing can only be understood through a close investigation
of the interconnections and transformation between clusters of metaphors. 
Derrida slyly indicates this problem when he explains that “everything which
Levinas designates as ‘formal logic’ is contested in its root.  This root would
not only be the root of our language, but the root of all western philosophy” (<i>WD
</i>91). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Derrida’s hint suggests that the easiest place to begin looking at
Levinas’s immanent wordplay would be in his etymological roots.  For example,
the Indo-European root “STA” has a long tradition in philosophy.  Greek thought
articulates it as “<i>hypoSTAsis,</i>” which is transformed into Latin as “<i>subSTAntia</i>.”
In “The Origin of the Work of Art,” Heidegger considers this translation of
philosophical terms to be one of the primordial stages in the forgetting of
Being (<i>BW </i>153). He redeploys this root using terms common to the German
philosophical tradition such as “<i>VerSTAnd</i>” (understand), “<i>GegenSTAnd</i>”
(represent) and “<i>VorSTEllung</i>” (notion), and he coins new terms such as “<i>GeSTEll</i>”
(enframing) (<i>BW </i>301).  Almost parodying Heidegger, Levinas retranslates
this German lexicon back into a Latin tongue, “romancing” the words back into a
Romance language.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[8]</span></span></span></a> 
Not only does Levinas reclaim the term “hypostasis,” he transmutes this root
into terms such as “deSTItution,” “subSTItution,” and “inSTItution.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Derrida warns against the temptations of etymological thinking (<i>MP</i>
210), so I would not make the strong claim that Levinas puts his faith in the
French language the same way Heidegger considers German to be the “House of
Being” (<i>BW </i>193).  Whatever the ultimate ontological status of language,
it seems clear that Levinas carefully picks each word in his texts with
attention to its etymological and morphological resonances.  In the 1940s,
Levinas displays this extraordinary attention to linguistic detail by noting
that what Heidegger’s “being-in-the-world,” “being-for-death,” and
“being-with-Others” add to our philosophical knowledge “is that these
prepositions – ‘in’, ‘for’, and ‘with’ are in the root of the verb ‘to be’ (as
‘ex’ is in the root of the verb ‘to exist’)” (Wahl  50).  Thus, we should
assume that Levinas is always aware of roots, prefixes, and suffixes; of the
nominal, verbal, prepositional, adjectival, and adverbial parts of speech; of
the active, middle, and passive voices; of the nominative, vocative, dative,
genitive, ablative, accusative and even locative cases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>In addition to these morphological considerations, we must attend to the
semantic connections between various etymological networks.  For example, words
rooted in “STA” (e.g. stand), must be correlated with other etymological
networks connoting position and proximity, as well as those connoting height
and depth.  The very word “origin” comes from <i>oriri, </i>to rise:  for
Levinas, man has “overcome” the “destitution” of his “animal needs” (<i>TI</i>
116-17) to become <i>homo erectus,</i> already erect and masterful and virile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Now that we have proposed an immanent hermeneutical strategy, we are bold
enough to ask the broader interpretive question:  what are Levinas’s books
about?  What storyline runs through his work? When we pay close attention to
the etymological and the semantic networks immanent to his sentences, we notice
that the same motifs crop up again and again under new transformations.<a
href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[9]</span></span></span></a> 
Derrida gives us an insight into how metaphors develop through Levinas’s work:
“<i>Totality and Infinity</i> … proceeds with the infinite insistence of waves
on a beach:  return and repetition, always, of the same wave against the same
shore, in which, however, as each return recapitulates itself, it also
infinitely renews and enriches itself” (<i>WD</i> 312, n7). That is, Levinas’s
writing, both across the span of his works and within a single text, can be
understood as a process of reiterative rewriting.  Despite the fact that <i>Totality
and Infinity</i> is broken up into a certain number of sections, chapters and
subsections; and that <i>Otherwise than Being</i> was published 12 years after <i>Totality
and Infinity</i>; and that Levinas’s religious work must be distinguished from
his philosophical writings, I would argue that Levinas discusses one and only
one thing again and again: I confront you; or, put dialogically, I converse
with the Other; you say some thing to me and I listen, and then I say some
thing to you and you listen.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>What animates Levinas’s corpus is that each new analysis gives us a new
perspective on this singular situation.  I would in fact argue that the notion
of “perspectivism” is as important for understanding Levinas’s work as it is
for Nietzsche’s.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span

Although the dialogical relation of speech surmounts the theoretical stance of
vision, Levinas still retains the notion of perspective, explaining that
“ethics itself is an optics” (<i>TI</i> 23).  He does not abandon visuality,
but instead warps it, perverts it.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span

“The differences between the Other and me … are due to the I-Other conjuncture,
to the inevitable <i>orientation</i> of being ‘starting from oneself’ towards
‘the Other.’  The priority of this orientation over the terms that are placed
in it (and which cannot arise without this orientation) summarizes the theses
of the present work” (<i>TI</i> 215).<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Once we understand the way that Levinas’s perspectives bend, we can begin
to reflect upon the metaphorical networks that illuminate his work.  Most
frequently, Levinas indicates the double-sidedness of a phenomenological event
by reversing a perspective.  For example, to claim only that the Other is
situated in an elevated state as the “Most High” is to miss the full dynamic
mobilization of this metaphor.  The “height” of the other is the hyperbolic
correlate and the perspectival reversal of the “the upsurge of the self (<i>le
surgisment de soi</i>) … One becomes a subject of being … [by] an exaltation,
an ‘above being’” (<i>TI</i> 119, <i>TeI </i>123).  Keeping in mind that the
French root “<i>sur</i>” means “over,” we can then understand why Levinas
insists that we experience history as a “SURvivor” (<i>TI</i> 57), why infinity
“SURpasses itself” (<i>TI</i> 103), and why fecund temporality is a
“reSURrection” (<i>TI</i> 56).  Through a different perspectival reversal, this
height of separation can also be expressed as “an abyss within enjoyment
itself” (<i>TI</i> 141), which becomes articulated as my “hypostasis” (<i>TO</i>
54-55) and the Other’s “destitution” (<i>TI</i> 78).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Now that we have a preliminary understanding of Levinas’s particular
usage of tropes, we can better investigate why he seems so attached to what
Derrida calls “the family schema” (<i>PF</i> viii). Already a doubling reversal
is expressed through this trope: the “familiar” already hyperbolically inverts the
Other’s existence as an alien, as “not resting on any prior kinship” (<i>TI</i>
34).  For Levinas, the notion of “family” connotes the way an individuated,
separated multiplicity of entities are already related to each other, through
social temporalities and moral obligations that preexist the political order.  Contrasting
his analysis with a philosophical tradition stretching from Plato to Hegel, he
asserts “the family does not only result from a rational arrangement of
animality; it does not simply mark a step towards the anonymous universality of
the State.  It identifies itself outside of the State, even if the State
reserves a framework for it” (<i>TI </i>306).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Filiality does not emerge simply as a social construction, but rather
constitutes a responsibility for other human beings independently of unifying
structures such as Hegelian Spirit or Heideggerean Being.  Writing from within
the phenomenological tradition, Levinas most pointedly questions the reductive
universalization of Husserl’s <i>genus</i> (<i>TI</i> 194-96), a term derived
from the Indo-European GEN, signifying “birth.”<a href="#_edn13"

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[13]</span></span></span></a> 
For Levinas, the generative family demonstrates that, rather than merely
issuing from an origin, existence is a continuous creation: “the discontinuity
of Cartesian time, which requires a continuous creation, indicates the very
dispersion and plurality of created being” (<i>TI</i> 58).<a href="#_edn14"

the story of the engendering of generations.  It tells a story of life stage
development, from birth through mature home ownership, through old age, through
sex and death, to rebirth.  Levinas employs the terminology of birth repeatedly
to describe a variety of interconnected phenomenological events such as the
“latent birth” of the subject (<i>OTB</i> 139), the “birth of love” in Eros (<i>TI</i>
277), and the “birth of thought, consciousness, justice, and philosophy … of a
meaning” through the third party (<i>OTB</i> 128).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>In the life-stage narrative of <i>Totality and Infinity</i>, the event of
birth is explored through the opening section on enjoyment, “the very
production of a being that is born, that breaks the tranquil eternity of its
seminal or uterine existence to enclose itself in a person” (<i>TI </i>147).<a

The motifs Levinas employs in this original section are connected to other
metaphorical networks throughout his work.  In addition to being a member of
the biblical triad of destitution along with the stranger and the widow (<i>TI</i>
77), the “orphan” describes a particular aspect of this production of being,
“an orphan by birth” (<i>OTB</i> 105).  This orphan event occurs because the
child is born separated, after the erotic death of the mother and the father,
“having absolved oneself from relations” (<i>TI</i> 195), separated from all
relatives, constantly menaced by neediness.  One reversal of this concept--this
conception--of the orphan is the concept of the work, which Levinas describes
as “always in a certain sense an <i>abortive </i>action” (<i>TI</i> 228, my
italics), a doubling of birth and death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>As mentioned above, this continuous GENesis must be understood as a
creative enGENdering, and thus gender informs all phenomenological matters.  As
with the family, gender is essential for overcoming a unifying totality. 
Levinas asserts, “The difference between the sexes is a formal structure, but
one that carves up reality in another sense and conditions the very possibility
of reality as multiple, against the unity of being proclaimed by Parmenides” (<i>TO</i>
44).  For Levinas, gender is essential for breaking with “the neuter (the sole
gender formal logic knows)” (<i>TI</i> 256), and with the neutral, Heideggerean
Being that Blanchot criticizes (<i>TI</i> 298).  Unlike German and English
which do have neuter cases, the French language gives all proper nouns a
masculine or feminine gender.  For example, “<i>le sujet</i>” is masculine in
French, just as human subjectivity and political citizenship have traditionally
been figured as masculine by male philosophers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Now that we have begun to understand what the theme of gender signifies
for Levinas, we can begin to consider the meaning of the Feminine.  Perversely,
I am going to attempt to give this Feminine a proper name, a biblical name.  It
is not one of the feminine names Levinas gives in “Judaism and the Feminine”
such as Miriam or Tamar or Leah (<i>DF</i> 31), but it is perhaps the most
frequently used name in the bible.  Before I produce this woman before you, let
me begin by suggesting that, in his early work, Levinas states that “all
philosophy is perhaps a meditation on Shakespeare” (<i>TO</i> 72).  In contrast
to the tragic Greek heroes who confront death as part of their fate and destiny
in a Heideggerean Being-towards-Death, Levinas discusses man’s confrontation
with death through the character of Macbeth.  Macbeth not only wishes that the
world would die along with him, “he wishes that the nothingness of death be a
void as total as that which would have reigned had the world <i>never been
created</i>” (<i>TI</i> 231, my italics).  Two important things must be said
about this dramatic person who opposes origination.  First of all, he is warned
by the witches--the Moirae, the Fates--that his death will come at the hands of
an Other who is “not of woman born,” his friend MacDuff.  Second, in order to
understand who Macbeth himself is, we must understand that “Mac” is a common
Gaelic prefix for “son of.”  “MacBeth” is quite an unusual name because
generally these names are patronymic, such as “Johnson” for the son of John or
“MacDonald” for the son of Donald, but in this case it would appear that this
familiar character is the son of a woman named “Beth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>There are multiple reasons why it is useful to express the Feminine as
being named “Beth.”  In Hebrew, “Beth” signifies not only a proper name, but
also the second letter of the alphabet, <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1468;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>.  It can function as a locative prefix
indicating “inside,” perhaps even “interiority.”  Although <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1468;</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> is the
second letter of the alphabet, it is the first letter of creation, the first
letter in the first word of the first parshah of the first book of Torah: <b><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:200%'>&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</span></b><span

dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>, “In the beginning.” Already in this very
word, the root <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>--which can be translated as “head” or
“first” or even “<span style='font-family:Tahoma'>&#7936;</span>&#961;&#967;&#942;”--
is preceded by the secondary letter <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1468;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>.  “Beth” in Hebrew signifies not only the
letter <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1468;</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span>, but also the word <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>, which translates as “house,” even as
“dwelling.”  For this reason, “Beth” is the most frequently used feminine name
in the Bible, as a locative signifier in place names such as “Bethel” and “Beth
Israel.”  Again, the first word of Torah, <b><span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:200%'>&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;</span></b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>In addition to these various linguistic meanings, <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1468;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> also has a mathematical signification: 
Because Hebrew uses letters to represent numbers, <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1468;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> also signifies the number 2.  One of the
motifs that most pervasively underlies the Levinas’s work is the question of
number.  Like many philosophers before him, Levinas confronts a perennial
mathematical problem: when we think of a certain quantity of things, we
generally conceive of a singularity rather than a multiplicity.  That is, when
we contemplate “twenty dogs,” we typically consider this as a single group of
twenty rather than thinking the twenty-ness of the twenty itself.  Levinas
expresses this problem through meditations on plurality and multiplicity “The
plural … is given to a number.  Unity alone is ontologically privileged. 
Multiple is, but in synthesis is no more” (<i>TI</i> 274).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

me state that there is something almost Pythagorean in his thought, in the
sense that numbers are not used merely for counting, but themselves describe
certain configurations of Being.  A thorough investigation will require
additional study, but we can begin to account for his numbers here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Levinas thinks the “negative” in tension with the skeptical negations of
Descartes (<i>TI</i> 92-93), the dialectical negation of Hegel’s <i>Aufhebung</i>
(<i>TI</i> 305), and the negation of <i>Dasein</i>’s death (<i>TI</i> 56).  He invokes
the terrible quality of the negative as the <i>il y a</i>, that which exists
after the negation of all particular, positive entities (<i>TI</i> 190, cf. <i>EE</i>
57-64).  On the other hand, I establish my own positive, separated selfhood by
negating alterity through labor and integrating it back into the Same (<i>TI</i>
40-41). Against this murderous violence that “proceeds from unlimited negation”
(<i>TI</i> 225), the Other can “sovereignly say no” (<i>TI</i> 199).  Negation
occurs not only in this masculine confrontation, but also through the feminine
“less than nothing” (<i>TI</i> 258) encountered in Eros which has “reference
--be it negative--to the social” (<i>TI</i> 262).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Closely related to but distinct from the negative is the zero. Before the
positive singularity of selfhood, zero occurs as anarchy (<i>OTB</i> 99), the
zero point (<i>TI</i> 159), the null site (<i>OTB</i> 10), creation <i>ex
nihilo</i> (<i>TI</i> 104)<i>,</i> freedom originally null (<i>TI</i> 224)<i>.</i> 
More generally, zero describes a boundary surrounding positive existence as the
elemental menace of nowhere (<i>TI</i> 141), the void of illumination (<i>TI</i>
189), the nothingness of the future (<i>TI</i> 146), and the “no man’s land.”<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[17]</span></span></span></a> 
Relationships through the zero occur as the erotic caress “seizing upon nothing”
(<i>TI</i> 257), the ethical “exteriority coming from nothingness” (<i>TI</i>
293), substituting oneself in a “null place” (<i>OTB</i> 116), and fraternity
as “a complicity for nothing” (<i>OTB</i> 150).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Now that we have begun to work through the negative and the zero, we can
think through the positive, in which we can already hear spatial “position,”
cognitive “positing,” and philosophical “positivism.” The social and political
are produced as a “multiplicity” or “plurality” (<i>TI</i> 220-2), which is
related to but distinct from the “third party” who calls for justice (<i>TI</i>
157).  Alterity itself can be considered as the greatest positive of all,
“infinity” (<i>TI</i> 41).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

number one.  One is invoked as zero, as the neutralizing, nullifying
singularities of the “unity of the system” (<i>TI</i> 150) and
“universalization” (<i>TI</i> 247).  One occurs as singular masculine
subjectivity in the “solitude” of “man” (<i>TI</i> 119), as well as in the
“happiness [that] comes for the first time” (<i>TI</i> 114), and the apologetic
“speech in the first person” (<i>TI</i> 242).  Doubling into one occurs in the
“dual solitude” (<i>TI</i> 265) of Eros. Dialogically, it manifests in the
ethical relation to the Other because the neighbor is “the first one on the
scene” (<i>OTB</i> 11), whose “first teaching” of ethical height (<i>TI</i>
171) expresses “the first word ‘you shall not commit murder’” (<i>TI</i> 199). 
Because the Other is “from the first the brother of all men” (<i>OTB</i> 158),
a “community” (<i>TI</i> 214) can arise in which “the unity of plurality is
peace” (<i>TI</i> 306).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

motif of “one” before evaluating Levinas’s assertion that morality is “first
philosophy” (<i>TI </i>304) or to address the problem that he “privileges”
masculinity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Just as there is a certain masculinity associated with the single,
femininity is typically manifested as double. Levinas most explicitly refers to
the duality of gender in his Judaic writings.  “Did not God give the name
‘Adam’ to man and woman joined together as if the two were one, as if the unity
of the person were able to triumph over the dangers lying in wait for it only
by virtue of a duality inscribed in its essence” (<i>DF</i> 33).  Levinas
distinguishes yet relates this biblical story of gender division from the tale
of sexual mitosis and nostalgia that Aristophanes recounts in the <i>Symposium</i>,
which he instead uses to illustrate the “incestuous” character of Eros (<i>TI</i>
254).  Beyond this, 2, by being the first plural after the singular 1, first
opens up plurality as such.  Thus, Levinas asserts that the vital impulse
“presupposes the intervals of sexuality and a specific dualism in its
articulation. … Sexuality is in us neither knowledge nor power, but the very
plurality of our existence” (<i>TI</i> 276).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

already within all terms prefixed by “equi,” “ambi,” “amphi,” or “dia,” such as
“equivocation,” “ambiguity,” “amphibology,” “ambiguity,” and “diachrony.” The
double indicates the dynamic tension of the “non-assemblable duality” (<i>OTB</i>
69), and of the diachronic interval “between two times” (<i>TI</i> 58).
Doubleness articulates the orientation between every trope, such as the
relation between masculine Height and its hyperbolic correlate, feminine
Depth.    This dynamic reversal occurs not just between the genders in
sexuality, but also as the homosocial “man to man,” the ethical “face to face”
(<i>TI</i> 79-81). Through enjoyment and recursion, this doubling is produced
even in the relationship between the ego and the self, the <i>moi</i> and the <i>soi
</i>(<i>TO </i>56), the nominative “I” and the accusative “me” (<i>OTB </i>112).</p>

and the importance of duality throughout Levinas’s work, we can begin to think
more carefully about the problem of the “Feminine” in Levinas.  Not only does
Levinas explicitly discuss the feminine and masculine aspects of the Other, a
careful reading of his texts indicates that these structures of masculinity and
femininity are also present within the Self.  This is most evident in his
description of the Home, whose condition is the Woman.<a href="#_edn20"

The principal role of the feminine dwelling is to provide the site for
reversion, the base of welcoming (<i>accueil</i>) for recollection (<i>recueillement</i>)
(<i>TI </i>155; <i>TeI 165</i>), of acceptance for receptivity.  Levinas
describes this phenomenological production, saying “this refers us to its
essential interiority, and to the inhabitant that inhabits it before every
inhabitant, the welcoming<i> par excellence,</i> welcome in itself – the
feminine being” (<i>TI</i> 157).  If Levinas here characterizes feminine
alterity by the “welcome” it offers, then we can only conclude that <i>I</i> am
figured as a woman only a few pages later.  “I welcome the Other who presents <i>himself</i>
in my home by opening my home to <i>him</i>” (<i>TI</i> 171, my italics).  In
fact, my identification as a welcoming woman is the very basis of Levinasian
ethics: “metaphysics, transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same, of
the other by me, is concretely produced as the calling into question of the
same by the other, that is, as ethics that accomplishes the critical essence of
knowledge” (<i>TI</i> 43).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Even more than his linking of womanhood with domesticity, Levinas’s
description of the erotic feminine Beloved in “The Phenomenology of Eros” has
incurred condemnation from feminist critics for its usage of stereotypical
motifs.  It is easiest to conceptualize this section if we remember that the
French slang for orgasm is “<i>la petite mort,</i>” the little death.  When we
read <i>Totality and Infinity</i>’s central narrative as being about continuous
creation and recreation, we see that the story has brought the subject from
childhood enjoyment (147-51), to matrimony (154-56), to adult labor and mastery
(158-62), and then to an awareness of temporal mortality (226-36).  After this,
the storyline of the “Phenomenology of Eros” transits through the arc of death
and rebirth, from “dying without murder” (258), to sexual “voluptuosity as a
pure experience” (260), to the womblike “community of sentient and sensed”
(265), and then to the “engendering of the child” (266).  Within this
narrative, Levinas employs several characterizations of the feminine Beloved (<i>aimée</i>)
that have given rise to considerable controversy, especially his description of
“the beloved return[ing] to the stage of infancy ... [like] a young animal” (<i>TI</i>
263, see Walsh 80-82 for a critique).  In response, one should first point out
that the motifs Levinas employs in this section also relate to the wider
metaphorical networks that constitute his thought: the “frailty” of the Beloved
relates to the dynamics of “destitution;” her “foreignness to the world”
relates to the “alterity” of the Other; her secrecy and profanation, hiddenness
and monstrousness relate to the question of expression and appearance; her
“nudity” relates to the tropes of embodiment and exposure; her
“ultramateriality” relates to “matter” and the “body;” her “virginity” and
“violability” relate to the problematics of “violence” and “murder.”  As
mentioned above, the motif of “infancy” partakes in the network of terms
connoting birth, which Levinas describes in the phenomenology of separated
enjoyment.  In this section, Levinas also introduces an almost-Bergsonian
notion of “animal need liberated from vegetable dependence.”<a href="#_edn21"

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>This explication does not necessarily blunt the feminist critique of his
thought, but it complicates the issue considerably.   Simone De Beauvoir is
precisely correct:  Levinas <i>does</i> “privilege” the masculine. For him,
tropes signifying one-ness and first-ness refer to the masculine, and tropes
signifying duality and two-ness refer to the feminine.  However, it is unclear
whether we should necessarily reach from these facts the conservative
conclusion that primacy is “better” than secondariness or that masculinity is
“better” than femininity.  </p>

further by questioning the very binary division of sexuality. “Power appeared
to operate in the production of that very binary frame for thinking about
gender … that binary relation between ‘men’ and ‘women’” (xxviii).  Those
attempting to overcome binary gender divisions will find that, in many ways,
gender is the binarism of binarisms for Levinas, that it could perhaps be
considered the paradigm for all other binarisms.  I  would argue, however, that
sexuality is already so overdetermined for Levinas that it already anticipates
or includes within it the movements of deconstruction and dialectic, and thus a
deconstructive or dialectical critique must proceed carefully.<a href="#_edn22"

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Levinas explains repeatedly that the dualism of gender is related to but
not reducible to the biological division between the sexes.  Thus, we could
perhaps use his thought to open up the categories of “masculinity” and
“femininity” for various biological genders; to oppose, along with Judith
“Jack” Halberstam, the fact that “masculinity … has been reserved for people
with male bodies and has been actively denied to people with female bodies”
(269).  Ultimately, for Levinas, no matter the biological or ontological
gender, both the Self and the Other always embody both feminine and masculine
traits in a state of metaphysical ambisexuality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>A perverter of philosophy, Emmanuel Levinas continuously corrupts ontological
relationships, demonstrating how ethical ambiguity prevents the copula, the
third-person “is” of a neutral Being, from reducing the essential Saying to a
nominal Said (<i>OTB </i>41-4). According to him, the being of the Self is not
a straightforward self-relation but rather a “fundamental inversion, not of
just some function of being, a function turned from his end, but an inversion
in his very exercise of being” (<i>TI</i> 63, translation modified).  The Self
does not relate to itself through a reflection of selfhood, but rather through
the Other, both through an actual human Other and also through the Other that the
Self was in the past and the Other that it will be in the future.  Magnetized
by the displacement that separates the Self from the Other, the ethical
relationship perverts Being from any simple, straight union.  Just as Freud
describes perversion as a deviation of the normal sexual aim, “the union of the
genitals in the act known as copulation” (15), Levinas explains how the “return
to oneself” (<i>TI </i>266)<span class=MsoEndnoteReference> </span>of
copulation is perverted in the “Phenomenology of Eros” (<i>TI </i>256-266).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Levinas’s description of the very site of the dual relationship, Eros, is
profoundly ambiguous.  It is often unclear how to distinguish the Lover from
the Beloved and the I from the Other; to figure out who is who and who is doing
what to whom; to understand which is feminine and which masculine.  Even more
explicitly than the case of welcoming home, Eros affects a gender
transformation.  In a statement that can read heterosexually, homosexually,
transsexually, or completely otherwise, Levinas explains, “The relation with
the carnal and the tender precisely makes this self arise incessantly:  the
subject’s trouble is not assumed by his mastery as a subject, but in his
entenderment [<i>attendrissement</i>], his effemination, which the heroic and
virile I will remember as one of those things that stand apart from ‘serious
things’” (<i>TI</i> 270, <i>TeI </i>303, translation modified).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Reading perversely, I would argue that the section “Substitution” in <i>Otherwise
than Being </i>is Levinas’s return, reversion, and reversal of <i>Totality and
Infinity</i>’s analysis of Eros, a more developed account of the “effemination”
of the “virile I.”  Levinas claims in this chapter that the approach of the
neighbor is experienced as a “non-erotic proximity, a desire of the
non-desirable, a desire of the stranger in the neighbor” (<i>OTB</i> 123).  We
should not let ourselves be misled by these negations: Levinas repeatedly distinguishes
his philosophy from “formal logic,” which would deduce a complete absence from
a negative operation.  Negation is never simple elimination but rather the
enactment of a certain type of relationship.  Derrida emphasizes the importance
of these reversals: “It could doubtless be shown that it is in the nature of
Levinas’s writing, at its decisive moments, to move along these cracks,
masterfully progressing by negations and by negation against negation” (<i>WD</i>
90).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>When we ourselves explore these cracks, working backwards from the
“non-erotic” moment, we can see how extraordinarily sexual “Substitution” is. 
The description “non-erotic” occurs in the sixth subsection of the chapter
(“Finite Freedom”), in which Levinas contrasts “infantile spontaneity” with the
created “subject come late into the world” (<i>OTB</i> 122).  Previous to this,
Levinas seems to be describing a process of maternal childbirth – not merely in
his explicit reference to “maternity” (<i>OTB </i>104), but also “the self as a
creature is <i>conceived</i> in a passivity” (<i>OTB</i> 113, my italics), and
“its recurrence is the <i>contracting </i>of an ego” (<i>OTB</i> 114, my
italics).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Previous to this description of birthing, Levinas seems to describe
metaphorically a process of fornication, in which I am situated as the recipient
of the Other’s thrusts.  I am posited as an open orifice, an event of being
which is the “folding back” (<i>OTB</i> 110) or the “hollowing out the fold of
inwardness, in which knowledge is deposited, accumulated and is formulated” (<i>OTB</i>
28).  Levinas explains that the for-itself is “not the germinal model” (<i>OTB </i>106),
but rather occurs in the accusative as my “pure surrender to the logos” (<i>OTB</i>
110) -- the logos which is perhaps the <i>logos spermatikos</i>, the
fertilizing power of reason.  Similarly, Levinas explains my loss of
sovereignty as an experience of being pricked from the rear.  “Backed up
against itself … the self in its skin is both exposed to the exterior … and
obsessed by the others in this naked exposure” (<i>OTB</i> 112). In contrast,
the Other seems to be getting an erection:  whereas my soul is not “thickening
and tumefying” (<i>OTB</i> 109), the Good is a “firmness more firm than firm”
(112). Ultimately, the Other is experienced as an “entry inwards” (<i>OTB</i>
108); a diachrony that signifies “the one-penetrated-by the-other” (<i>OTB</i>
49).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Levinas’s description is suggestive enough that this penetration may be
interpreted in a heterosexual “biblical” manner, or in the “Greek” way so
beloved by Plato’s symposiasts. In many ways a homosexual interpretation seems
more plausible.  In <i>Totality and Infinity</i>, Eros can be read as
heterosexual because it occurs between a masculine lover (<i>l’amant</i>) (<i>TI
</i>257, <i>TeI </i>288) and a feminine Beloved (<i>l’Aimée</i>) (<i>TI </i>256,
<i>TeI </i>286), who Levinas characterized as a “sister soul” that
“self-presents as incest” (<i>TI</i> 254, translation modified). 
“Substitution,” however, makes no mention of this feminine Beloved<i>.  </i>Instead,
she has been substituted by a past conditional subjunctive perfect “would have
liked to pair up a sister soul [of] substitution and sacrifice” (<i>OTB</i>
126), a figure more reminiscent of Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i> than
Aristophanes’ fable.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Our interpretation will become even more blasphemous once we examine the
radical turning that determines Levinas’s orientation, sexual and otherwise,
the root <i>verter</i>.  Levinas uses the language of <i>inversion</i> in
“Substitution,” describing obsession as an “inversion of consciousness [that]
is no doubt a passivity – but it is a passivity beneath all passivity” (<i>OTB</i>
101).  This “inversion” can perhaps be understood as a rethematization of the
Erotic “effemination;” in his seminal work, Havelock Ellis defined inversion as
“sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of
the same sex” (1).  The invocation of passivity can similarly remind us of
Foucault’s discussion of the Greek <i>polis</i>.  According to Foucault, the
Greeks juxtaposed “an ethos of male superiority” with “a conception of all
sexual intercourse in terms of the schema of penetration and male domination.” 
Thus, Athenian democracy was compelled to maintain the principles of political
equality among male citizens while still recognizing one as the active,
masculine sexual partner and the other as passive and “<i>feminized</i>”
(220-22).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>For Levinas, does not the ethical itself emerge as this very
reconciliation of a dual Eros and a fraternal community?  Levinas seems to
highlight the Foucaultian problematic of homosociality, of sociality and
homosexuality, by referring to the “will”-- my virile self-assertion--as “the
psyche backed up against itself,” exposing its hindquarters.  He draws
attention to this issue by using the conspicuously obscure term
“tergiversation” (<i>OTB</i> 112), turning us back to the same Latin root, <i>tergum</i>
(back) + <i>verter</i> (turn).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:

As many authors including Derrida (<i>WD</i> 108) and Cohen (<i>EHG</i> 244 n5)
have commented, Levinas’s reflections on this figure should return us back to
the biblical description of the face-to-face in Exodus 33:11-23. 
Interestingly, the Hebrew term for face, <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><i><span dir=LTR></span>, </i>derives etymologically from the
root<i> </i><span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span>, to turn.  Thus, this same passage of Torah again reverts to a
primordial turning.<i>  </i>In this strange narrative, God first speaks<i> </i>“face-to-face”
(<span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span><span

dir=LTR></span>, from the root <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>) goes with the Jewish people. After Moses
asks not just to <i>speak</i> to the Lord but to actually <i>see</i> “Your
Glory” (<span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1498;&#1464;</span><span

dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>, from the root <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1508;&#1504;&#1492;</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>) and live. Instead, God asks Moses to
stand upon a rock.  “And it shall come to pass, while My Glory (<span lang=HE
dir=RTL>&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;</span><span

My face (<span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1508;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;</span><span

necessarily agree with the Freudian interpretation of this verse as a proof of
Jewish anal eroticism (Dundes 125), we must admire here how odd it is to have
this Jewish patriarch, this first Messiah of the Jewish people, this leader of
the exodus from slavery, to have Moses looking at the Glory through a cleft, a
crack – we would dare say a “gloryhole” – gazing at the rear end of God.</p>

line-height:200%'>Conclusion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>When we try to get to the bottom of Levinas’s views on gender, on the Cheek-to-Cheek
relationship between the sexes, we are still left with an abyss, a gap <i>inter
urinas et faeces</i>, between the manifold creativities of ejaculation,
defecation, and parturition.  For Levinas, this is the very hole that separates
the masculine from the feminine, a difference that corresponds most apparently
to heterosexual positions but that perhaps can be also perverted for
homosexuality, lesbianism, transgender, and other forms of queer sexuality.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Gender and sexuality for Levinas constitute some of the most fundamental
ways that difference is produced in experience, the most important ways that
Otherness resists neutral universalization.  However, as many critics have objected
and as this paper has affirmed throughout, Levinas problematically employs patriarchal
themes in his argument.  We still who find value in Levinas’s work must accept
responsibility for this rhetoric, and must carefully consider creative ways to
respond to the protests it has engendered.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>Derrida suggest that perhaps one may try to read Levinas’s texts as “a
sort of feminist manifesto” (1999, 44).  Precisely because Levinas so deliberately
exposes patriarchy in his writing, feminist and queer interpreters can perhaps
use his thought to critique patriarchy’s legacy, to foster more gender openness,
and to reconsider the gender and sexual dimensions of various ethical
relationships as well as the ethical dimensions of various gender and sexual
relationships.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'>In the end, however, this author of this paper you are right now reading
can offer no final answer to these problems, but instead, as both a Levinas
scholar and an anarcha-feminist, can only thank you for your time and welcome your
responses.  </p>

FROM THE BOTTOM, </p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:200%'>AN OPEN LETTER TO RICHARD A.
COHEN AND DUQUENSE PRESS:</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In the final
chapter of <i>Elevations</i>, “Derrida’s (Mal)Reading of Levinas,” Richard A.
Cohen transforms Levinas’s eschatology of peace into a declaration of combat. 
In Cohen’s words, he “passes over the details of Derrida’s 99 page
deconstruction” (<i>EHG </i>305) and instead picks a fight between Derrida and
Levinas: “my intent is to explain why and with what good reason Derrida’s essay
has been construed as an attack on Levinas” (<i>EHG </i>314 n10).  Cohen
figures the “Levinas-Derrida conflict” (<i>EHG </i>306) as the very site of an
original <i>polemos</i> that “on this ultimate question, Athens or Jerusalem … the true or the good … one must take sides” (<i>EHG </i>315). Cohen argues
that Derrida takes Heidegger’s side.  Failing to recognize how Derrida
rearticulates the problematic of philosophy and its Other in order to return to
Levinas’s own problematic of Reason and its Other (<i>TI, </i>82-101), Cohen claims
that “Derrida’s ultimate response to Levinas is ostracism, exile, exclusion,
excision” from the philosophical community.</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Cohen
regularly attacks Derrida for being Heidegger’s “most faithful and clever” (<i>EEP
</i>4) disciple dangerously evoking the anti-Semitic disparagement of the Jew
for being merely “clever” (for example, Hitler 412 ff.)  Worse yet, because
Cohen believes Derrida to be a “sycophantic follower” (<i>EEP </i>121) of
Heidegger, he refuses to accept the mutual respect between Derrida and Levinas.
Alluding to <i>Adieu</i>, Derrida’s funeral oration to Levinas, Cohen accuses
Derrida of, “hiding behind the masks and ruses of language, language reduced to
rhetoric, escaping responsibilities and obligations by saying ‘adieu’ to
Levinas” (<i>EEP </i>160).  It is almost impossible to read a line so dense
with cruelty.  One trembles with anger and sadness at the demeaning of this
friend’s grievance for the loss of his friend, of this philosopher’s mourning
for another member of the philosophical fraternity, of this mother’s
hospitality that welcomes her child into death, of this sister’s obedience to
the divine law of <i>&#920;&#941;&#956;&#953;&#962;</i> that urges her towards
the anarchic responsibility of burying her beloved brother.</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Claiming that
Levinas “sides with” Jerusalem over Athens, Cohen turns Levinas into a
murderer, claiming that “Levinas cannot live with either Hegel or Derrida” (<i>EHG
</i>319).  I often wonder whether Cohen has read the same Levinas that I have. 
How could an interpreter of Levinas bring such violence into the field of
Levinas studies?  How could a reader of Levinas so willfully ignore his
prefatory quest to separate thought from war (<i>TI </i>21)?  Yet Cohen
repeatedly describes philosophical conversation in the most combative terms,
employing the language of fighting, applying Carl Schmitt’s logic of friend and
enemy, and transforming intellectuals into armies.  </p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Is philosophy
the same as pugilism and thinking the same as war? Are we who pretend to be
thinkers mere bullies who use ideas as if they were gloves to beat down
opponents?  Wouldn’t these blows knock us out, numb us into dogmatism, the
slumber from which Kant awoke us over two centuries ago?  </p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Do
philosophers <i>fight</i> or, as Levinas wonders, is “reason constituted rather
in a situation where ‘one chats,’ where the resistance of a being as a being is
not broken, but pacified?” (<i>IOF</i> 126-27)  Hasn’t philosophy been the
opportunity to consider what calls for thinking and to whom the intellectual is
responsible?  Can we philosophers be what Derrida in his essay on Levinas
refers to as “a community of the question about the possibility of the
question?  This is very little – almost nothing – but within it, today, is
sheltered and encapsulated … an unbreachable responsibility” (<i>WD</i> 80). 
Can’t we hear Levinas’s <i>direct response to Derrida</i>’s call to
responsibility in the conclusion of the introduction to <i>Otherwise than Being</i>:
“the naiveté of the philosopher calls, beyond the reflection for oneself, for
the critique exercised by <i>another </i>philosopher … Philosophy thus arouses
a drama between philosophers and an intersubjective movement”?(<i>OTB </i>20)?</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In its new
publication of <i>Otherwise than Being</i>, Duquesne Press has allowed Richard
A. Cohen to insert his Foreword before Alphonso Lingis’s thoughtful, analytic,
and often-translated Translator’s Introduction (for example, in <i>Cahier de
L'Herne: Emmanuel Lévinas, </i>edited by Catherine Chalier and Miguel Abensour<i>.</i>) 
In this essay, Cohen recruits Levinas as a warrior in “a new and future <i>gigantomachia</i>
that has arisen in the twentieth century” (<i>OTB </i>xiii).  It is
unbelievable that such a veritable call for the fratricide of Cain could enter
a book written by Levinas. Right here and right now, in the very Saying of this
very text, I am please requesting that Richard A. Cohen recant this violence,
and that he and Duquesne Press agree to remove this Foreword from all future
reprints</p>

Derrida writes, beautifully, “Levinas recommends the good usage of prose which
breaks Dionysiac charm or violence, and forbids poetic rapture, but to no
avail.  In <i>Totality and Infinity, </i>the use of metaphor, remaining
admirable and most often –if not always--beyond rhetorical abuse, shelters
within its pathos the most decisive movements of the discourse” (<i>WD</i> 312

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%'> Like many other philosophers, most
notably Heidegger in <i>Being and Time</i>, Levinas writes in a prismatic
manner.  His language is packed so tightly with words that have been chosen so
carefully and that reverberate against each other in such particular ways that,
perhaps if we meditated upon and fully analyzed just one sentence, it would
reveal the entire complexity of Levinas’s thought.  Conversely, almost
Talmudically, we need entire sections from other essays and books to interpret
the placement of each particular word in each particular sentence.</span></p>

Levinas develops his viewpoint on perspective through the motif of “the
curvature of intersubjective space [that] inflects distance into elevation” (<i>TI
</i>291).  This curvature occurs through a distortion of length and height, a
warping of vertical and horizontal dimensions, and a perversion of lateral and
hierarchical relationships.  Levinas’s notion of “height” has inspired Cohen to
discuss his hierarchical “elevations” and Bettina Bergo to look at his
stratified “levels of being” (Bergo 55-81).  In addition, Levinas also
describes the singular ethical confrontation as various angularities.  I would
suggest that the “schema of being” in <i>Totality and Infinity</i> does not, as
Bergo states, “resemble the figure of two parabolas intersecting at their
bases” (59).  Instead, his self-described “hyperbolic” (<i>OTB</i> 49)
phenomenology resembles a hyperbola, the eccentric set of points defined by the
difference between two separated points.  Perhaps each of his analyses could be
considered as describing the tangency of infinitely unapproachable asymptotes? 
Could this perhaps be compared to Lucretius and Deleuze’s “clinamen,” the
infinitesimal deviation from a straight path?  </p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:200%'>Even more ambitiously, perhaps
we could account for the multiplicity of tangent vectors by attempting parallel
transport between Levinas’s notion of curvature and the definition of curvature
proposed by mathematician Bernhard Riemann, “the measure of the deviation of
the manifold from flatness at the given point in the given surface-direction”
(657).  The analogy between Levinas and Riemann could be perhaps extended as
well to Einstein’s ideas on how gravitational mass-energy curves space-time.</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:200%'>Although we are mindful of
Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont’s warning to be cautious when employing technical
language, I would assert that there has always been a fruitful interchange
between the natural sciences and philosophy, even when they don’t entirely
understand each other.</p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:200%'>Levinas rarely makes ambitious
claims about mathematics, but he must have been familiar with basic concepts,
especially because at least two of his earliest philosophical influences, Henri
Bergson and Edmund Husserl, were former mathematicians who wrote about
mathematical concepts.   It seems likely that Levinas would have learned about
Bernhard Riemann through these authors.  Deleuze remarks, “Husserl too gained
inspiration from Riemann’s theory of multiplicities, although in a different
way from Bergson” (118n4).  Perhaps we could even trace a path from Riemann
manifolds, through Bergson and Husserl, to correlate the anarchic “multiplicities”
discussed by <i>both</i> Deleuze <i>and</i> Levinas.  </p>

Husserl himself seems to recognize the flexibility of this root by associating
essential “genus” and “genera” with logical “generality” (<i>Ideas</i> 24-25),
as well as “genetic” and “generative” phenomenology (<i>Analyses</i> 628). Even
more deliberately, Bergson argues that that a vital genesis ultimately
generates the neutral generality of <i>a priori</i> Kantian laws (245-46).</p>

In addition, this idea of continuous creation can be found in the Jewish
religion, both in the Talmud and in the morning blessing for the Lord who
“renews every day the work of creation.”  Levinas also finds the idea in the
Greek philosophy of Heraclitus and Cratylus who describe a “becoming …
radically opposed to the idea of being … the resistance to every integration …
destructive of Parmedian monism” (<i>TI</i> 59-60).  The difference is often
described as a distinction between Parmenidean <span style='font-family:Tahoma'>&#7952;&#8056;&#957;</span>,
Being / <i>Sein / être </i>and Heraclitean <span style='font-family:Tahoma'>&#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>,
which is generally translated either as genesis / <i>Genese</i> / <i>genèse</i>
or becoming / <i>Werden</i> / <i>devenir</i>.  The divergence and convergence
of these two sets of translations again announces intriguing proximities between
Levinas and Deleuze. </p>

Isn’t the face already two-sided?  The English word “face” can translate two
French, <i>visage </i>and <i>face</i>.  Lingis translates <i>le visage </i>as
“the face” of the transcendent Other (<i>TI</i> 25), and <i>la face </i>as “the
side” (<i>TI</i> 131) of the immanent element.  Following this logic, <i>le
face-à-face </i>should perhaps not be translated as “the face to face,” but
rather as the opposite, “the side-to-side.”  The ethical encounter occurs only
between two persons, two <i>persona</i>, two masks, two nobodies (<i>deux
personnes</i>); I confront only a front of the Other.  </p>

<p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:200%'>Given the ambiguity inherent
in the ethical situation, how can we philosophers then avoid Cohen’s relentless
urging to “take sides” and to treat thinking like a fight between Athens and
Jerusalem, a battle on the Western Front?</p>
