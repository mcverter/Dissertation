<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas’
analysis of light and his opposition to Heidegger can be understood through a
comparison of the Jewish and the Christian accounts of creation.  Following
Nietzsche, Heidegger explicitly critiques Christianity as a popularization of
the Platonic reduction of the logos (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>logoV</span>.)
Heidegger contends that the logos originally referred to Dasein as the
gathering-place for the strife (<span style='font-family:Symbol'>polemoV</span>)
of Being.  Christianity obscures this notion of logos-as-gathering by
interpreting Christ as the logos.  Following the Alexandrian-Jewish<a

style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> philosopher
Philo, the Gospel of John describes Jesus as the phenomenon which mediates
man’s relationship with the divine.  Furthermore, John 1:9 explains Christ as
the source of divine light as it is revealed to men, “That was the true Light,
which lights every man that comes into the world.”  Therefore, this book
collapses the concept of the logos as light with the notion of a publicly
accessible Word which subsists outside of man’s existence.  Against this,
Heidegger forwards an almost Gnostic idea<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[2]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> that
each Dasein, as an individual, can potentially exist as its own true light,
lighting itself as it comes into the world.  In contrast to both John’s and
Heidegger’s accounts of revelation, the Book of Genesis introduces God’s first
act of creation in the following manner: “And God said, ‘Let there be light’
and there was light.”  Contrary to the implicit claims of both John and Philo,
this verse does not merely imply that revelation occurs through a substantive
word, through the nominal.  Rather, it describes the light of phenomena as
preceded by and issuing forth from God’s exercise of speech.<a href="#_ftn3"

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas
describes the light of truth and of representation as something which becomes
manifested between speaking interlocutors.  In his book <u>Totality and
Infinity</u>, he carefully describes the phenomenological transformations of
this discussion.  Levinas describes me as I posit myself in a “Now,” in a
present moment in which I speak to the Other, am heard by her, and receive a
reply from him.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

As with Heidegger, Levinas employs the resources of Husserl’s phenomenology to
follow the course of this discussion.  Although Levinas, like Heidegger,
opposes Husserl’s model of intentionality for implicitly positing a
spectatorial subject which merely looks at an object, he finds metaphysical
notions within Husserl which subvert the apparent ontological interpretations. 
He claims that Husserl’s major insight was that “notions under the direct gaze
of thought that defines them are nevertheless, unbeknown to this naive thought
revealed to be implanted in horizons unsuspected by this thought ... The
break-up of the formal structure of thought (the noema of a noesis) into events
which this structure dissimulates, but which sustain it and restore its
concrete significance, constitutes a <i>deduction</i> — necessary and yet
non-analytical.”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[5]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Levinas demonstrates that the intentional relationship which separates
consciousness from its objects is not foundational, but rather is itself
produced through certain genealogical developments of the relationship between
the Other and me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas
claims, “The difference between the Other and me do not depend upon different
properties. ... They are due to the I-Other conjunction, to the inevitable <i>orientation</i>
of being “starting from oneself” towards “the Other.”  The priority of this
orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which can not arise
without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work.”<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

Levinas description of Being is as radically perspectival as Nietzsche’s.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[7]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
However, whereas Nietzsche describes the experiences of a subject whose being
and whose perspectives are determined by its will to power, Levinas describes
my experiences in having my being and my perspectives be determined by my
ethical position as the interlocutor of the Other.  Derrida’s analysis of the
structure of Levinas’ writing illuminates his intricate perspectivism.  “In <u>Totality
and Infinity</u> the thematic development is neither purely descriptive nor
purely deductive.  It proceeds with the infinite insistence of waves on a
beach:  return and repetition, always, of the same wave against the same shore,
in which however, as each return recapitulates itself, it also infinitely
renews and enriches itself.”<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
As Heidegger might say, Levinas’ writing repeatedly presents the same “factical
situation,” yet, each time, it thematizes this situation from a new
perspective.  By varying perspectives, Levinas does not merely give the reader
a “better view” of the same event.  Rather, these different perspectives constitute
each situation as a new and different ontological, phenomenological, and
metaphysical event.  These perspectives are produced as and through my
intercourse with the Other.  The evolution and transformation of our discussion
produces intentional relationships which connect us and which orient me
metaphysically.  I speak to the Other who responds to me.  As will be shown in
this paper, each event within this complex intercourse reveals its own
intentional horizons.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            To
fully understand Levinas’ conception of vision and power, one must trace how
these capacities evolve and transform throughout each stage of my ethical
development.  Against Heidegger’s description of Dasein as a dynamic
temporalization, Levinas analyzes the time of discourse as a series of
discrete, separated moments in which I am born, die and am reborn.  In <u>Time
and the Other</u>, he describes the birth of an individuated ego as his power
to posit his identity, thereby escaping from the <i>there is</i>, an impersonal
and eternal realm of undifferentiated existence.  <u>Totality and Infinity</u>
no longer refers to this event of separation as a power, but rather as the
capacity to resist totalization.  Levinas states, “The separation of the Same
is produced in the form of an inner life, as psychism ... It is already <i>a
way of being</i>, resistance to this totality. ... The dimension of the
psychism opens under the force of the resistance a being opposes to its
totalization.”<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
In direct opposition to Heidegger’s assertion that Dasein’s power develops from
its futural appropriation of its heritage, Levinas explains that my capacity to
resist the weight of the past in a present moment constitutes my force of
resistance.  Previous to this moment of separation, this separation in and as a
moment, I had effectively perished when my works and my statements were
alienated from myself by the impersonal institutions and public interpretations
which subsumed them.  I break with the domination of the totality by shedding
my former manifestation and founding myself in a new moment in which I have an
opportunity to make a new statement.  Not only does this psychism separate me
temporally, it also separates me ontologically.  Against Heidegger who sees
Dasein’s Being as always embedded within the impersonal dominance of Being, Levinas
reappropriates the Cartesian distinction between an internal mental sphere and
an external reality.  According to Levinas, I resist being absorbed by the
tyranny of Being by establishing the limit of my identity and creating an
interior psychical realm which can not be violated by any external force or
person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            My
birth in the instant initiates the life cycle of the moment.  Therefore, my
separated existence begins in the infantile state of enjoyment.  I steep myself
in the elemental qualities of the world, experiencing my sensations as the
contents of my existence.  Levinas explains that this state arises prior to my
development of a vision or a consciousness which would posit the world as a set
of individuated objects. He states, “...The sensible life is lived as
enjoyment.  This mode of life is not to be interpreted in function of
objectification ... Sensation recovers a ‘reality’ when we see in it not the
subjective counterpart of objective qualities, but an enjoyment anterior to the
crystallization of consciousness, I and non-I, subject and object”<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> Because
I bathe in the elemental medium I enjoy, I can not assume any external point of
view regarding it.  For example, I do not experience the analytic qualities of
the painting I view, but rather I live from my immersion in these colors.  In
order for me to view this painting as an object, I must have already submerged
myself in the painting’s affective qualities.  Not only does enjoyment precede
my capacity to view objects, it also occurs before I have the capacity to
represent my own existence to myself.  Because I absorb myself in an elemental
medium, I can not achieve a distance from myself from which I can observe
myself.  Through this analysis of enjoyment, Levinas describes a relationship
with the world which arises prior to my understanding of the world as a set of
usable tools.  For Heidegger, circumspection requires Dasein to view both the
beings in the world and its own potentiality-for-Being.  Because enjoyment
precedes the objectification of vision, it also prevents me from manipulating
the world as a set of objects.  Levinas explains that, “Tools themselves, which
are in-view-of-...become objects of enjoyment.”<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

position:relative;top:0pt'>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Against Heidegger, Levinas would claim that before I turn a handle to go through
a door, I enjoy the sensation of cold brass pressing against my palm.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Although
this state of enjoyment precedes my development of vision, Levinas does not
conclude that I am sightless, but rather that this state can not be
circumscribed within this dialectic.  Levinas only employs the language of
blindness to describe entities which lose their identity when they are forced
to participate in the totality of the <i>there is</i>.  He states,
“To-be-in-the-element does indeed disengage a being from blind and deaf
participation in a whole, but differs from a thought making its way outward.”<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

Because the <i>there is</i>  forces everything to go along with the current of
anonymous existence, it subsists prior to the self-identification of an I who
can feel its existence and its pleasures as its own.  Through my sensibility, I
overcome my depersonalization, separating myself from the <i>there is.</i> 
However, this absorption in the elemental does not allow me the imperialistic
freedom which I weld through representational vision.  Whereas vision requires
a distance from which to view objects, the elemental I merges with the
element.  “I am content ... with this horizon in which I live, turn to me; I do
not ground them in a more vast system.  It is they that ground me.  I welcome
them without thinking them.”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span

that the state of enjoyment is determined by a certain intentional
relationship.  However, rather than establishing my own horizons through a
noetic intention, the enjoying I finds itself already implanted within certain
horizons.  As will be explained below, these horizons of separation ultimately
emerge from the light emanated by my mother and father, the Other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Through
this description of life as enjoyment, Levinas allies himself with a Reichean
strategy of opposing the affirmation of pleasure to totalitarian control.  He
states “Here lies the permanent truth of hedonist moralities:  to not seek,
behind the satisfaction of need, an order relative to which alone satisfaction
would acquire a value; to take satisfaction, which is the very meaning of
pleasure, as a term.”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[15]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> Levinas
makes this radical embrace of sensuous pleasure central to the relationship
between the Other and me.  Both the Other and I exist as our love of our lives.
This enables each of us to exist as separated entities who resist being reduced
to abstract categories.  By affirming the importance of enjoyment, Levinas answers
Nietzsche’s claim that morality is grounded in a life-negating, ascetic <i>ressentiment.</i> 
Sounding very much like the Nietzschean philosopher Georges Bataille, he
states, “To enjoy without utility, in pure loss, gratuitously, without
referring to anything else, in pure expenditure — this is the human.”<a
href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Furthermore, Levinas explains that, throughout the ethical relationship with
the Other, I always maintain my separation through my sensibility.  “Whatever
be the transfigurations this egoism will receive from speech, it is for the
happiness constitutive of this very egoism that the I who speaks pleads.”<a
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Through this concept of enjoyment, Levinas adopts Nietzsche’s idea that
philosophy should affirm life while rejecting his assertion that this affirmation
must be an expression of a will-to-power.  He thereby avoids the nihilism of
traditional morality, yet does not describe life as a virile existence based
either on heroic self-projection like Heidegger or on brutal excess like
Bataille.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            By
making enjoyment the initial mode of relating to the world of things, Levinas
subverts the notion of virility implicit in Heidegger’s description of
concern.  As described in <u>Being and Time</u>, Dasein’s relationship with the
world as equipment posits Dasein as the master over the world of objects,
manipulating them to suit its own ends, to project its own possibilities.<a
href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

contrast, the enjoying I relates to the element through a paradoxical
combination of sovereignty and submission.  Immersed in the elemental medium, I
possess the qualities it offers to the extent that I let myself be possessed by
it.  Levinas contends, “The paradox of “living from something” ... is precisely
a complacency with regard to what life depends on — not a mastery on one hand
and a dependence on the other, but a mastery in this dependence.  Living
from... is the dependency that turns into sovereignty, into happiness —
essentially egoist.”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span

Absorbed in pure sensual qualities such as the warm radiance of the sun, I
depend upon the alterity of what it is not myself as the contents of my
existence.  At the same time, I integrate these sensations into my interiority,
thereby establishing my own independence.  In contrast to Heidegger who
analyzes of thrownness as the submission of Dasein, Levinas’ discussion of
sensibility outlines a more symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas
explores the paradoxical coincidence of the enjoying I’s submission and mastery
through his descriptions of suffering and need.  For the newly-birthed I,
suffering functions as the relative negation of enjoyment.  He states, “The
happiness of enjoyment flourishes on the “pain” of need and thus depends on an
“other””<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

Levinas explains that my satisfaction with the fulfillment of my needs
determines my life of happiness.  This satisfaction develops from the suffering
I feel from being dependent upon the relative alterity of the element.  This
suffering therefore does not contradict my enjoyment, but rather acts as a foil
which I oppose in the name of more enjoyment.  Levinas explains that my
dependence upon the elemental medium threatens me with the insecurity of the
future.  Because these momentary sensations are immediate and evanescent, the
unforeseeable future threatens to disintegrate them.  However, I can flee from
the deprivation of my needs in search of enjoyment.  The insecurity I feel
wrenches me out of the present, opening me up to a duration during which I can
forestall this disappearance.  Whereas my dependence upon my milieu causes me
to suffer, my needs determine my sovereignty.  “The alterity of the other the
world is is surmounted by need, which enjoyment remembers and is kindled by;
need is the primary movement of the same.  To be sure, need is also a
dependence with regard to the other, but it is a dependence across time ...
Needs are in my power.  They constitute me as the same and not as dependent on
the other.”<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span

By founding an interval of duration between myself and the immediacy of the
element, I establish a distance through which I can subordinate the relative
alterity of the milieu in the satisfaction of my needs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            I
articulate an interval which separates me from the element through the founding

The home enables me to mature from my infancy into my manhood.  Through it, I
can transform the antecedent, conditioning influences of the element into
things which seem to be posterior to and conditioned by my consciousness. 
Levinas states, “Consciousness of a world is already consciousness <i>through </i>that
world.  Something of that world seen is an organ or an essential means of
vision ... Hence the subject contemplating a world presupposes the event of
dwelling, the withdrawal from the elements ... recollection in the intimacy of

Socrates argues that all knowledge is derived from the self’s remembrance of
the knowledge which he had obtained during his past lives.  In <u>Totality and

past can only be mediated through the Other.  Through the feminine Other who
gives me birth and who listens to my speech, I establish a home which acts as a
precondition for my initiatives of power and my capacity for sight.  Through my
labor, I master the threatening insecurity of the chaotic element by seizing
it.  Levinas states, “Labor in its possessive grasp suspends the independence
of the element:  its being. ...  Possession masters, suspends, postpones the
unforeseeable future of the element — its independence, its being.”<a

distancing myself from my immersion in the milieu, I grasp the element as if it
were matter which offered resistance to my hand.  I exert my power over the
element by positing it as a set of permanent, possessable things which can be
deposited in the dwelling.  The home establishes my psychism by delimiting a
separated position for me.  Labor continues this separation by absenting my
interiority from the works I have objectified so that I can pursue an existence
independent of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
dwelling and the labor which take place in it enable me to acquire the capacity
for representational vision.  Levinas explains, “The dwelling remains in its
own way open upon the element from which it separates.  The ambiguity of
distance, both removal and connection, is lifted by the window that makes
possible a look that dominates, a look of him who escapes looks, the look that
contemplates.”<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span

The home capacitates vision by separating me from the element, giving me a
distance from which to direct a spectatorial gaze at the world.  The home
transforms the sensible enjoyment which conditions me into a spectacle which I
can represent as something conditioned.  “In clarity an object which is first
exterior <i>is given</i>, that is, is delivered over to him who encounters it
as though it had been entirely determined by him.”<a href="#_ftn28"
name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

position:relative;top:0pt'>[28]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> Representational
vision therefore functions as perhaps the primary way in which the embodied I
forestalls the insecurity threatened by the unforeseeable future. Levinas
states, “Vision is a forgetting of the <i>there is</i> because of the essential
satisfaction, the agreeableness of sensibility, enjoyment, contentment, with
the finite without concern for the infinite.  In fleeing itself in vision,
consciousness returns to itself.”<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span

Whereas the enjoyment of visual sensations separates me from the domination of
the <i>there is</i>, the visual sense as it is articulated in the body enables
me to absorb all phenomena within my own consciousness.  Furthermore, the
temporal interval which is produced as this dwelling suspends my immediate
reactions to the element so that I can observe myself.  Against Heidegger,
Levinas asserts that only an embodied and domiciled I who regards both itself
and objects can relate to the world <i>in view of</i> a greater attention to
its own possibilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Whereas
Heidegger tends to collapse the vision and the grasp, Levinas explains that I
require the labor of the hand before I can develop sight.  The hand establishes
my first mastery over the ominous element.  By assuming the element as a
permanent possession, I stave off the insecurity I feel in the face of the
unforeseeable future, the horror I feel in the face of the <i>there is</i>.  He
states, “Labor, the hold on matter, is not a vision or thought in which matter
already determined would be defined by relation to infinity;  within the grasp
matter precisely remains fundamentally indefinite. ... But it renounces its
anonymity, since the primordial hold of labor introduces it into a world of the
identifiable, masters it.”<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span

The hand which labors seizes the element before I have fully articulated the
subject-object distinction which vision capacitates.  Therefore, the hand does
not function with the intentionality of a sense organ, but rather as a blind
grasping which masters the element by relating it to me.  By doing so, the hand
suspends the obscurity of matter, making it identifiable.  Out of the chaotic
and unforeseeable element, labor posits discernible things which I can
represent to myself.  This domination therefore illuminates a world which I can
apprehend in my consciousness.  Levinas explains, “The ‘representation’ of the
end and the movement of the hand that plunges towards it thorough an unexplored
distance, preceded by no searchlight, constitute one and the same event.”<a
href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

The blind groping of the hand therefore determines the world which I can
contemplate as a visual spectator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
development of the visual faculty consummates the foundation of my sovereign
interiority.  Representational vision views the world through the safe distance
which the dwelling effects between the ominous element and me.  The light which
possession sheds upon the world neutralizes the relative alterity of the unforeseeable
element.  After the chaotic element has been stabilized, the securely domiciled
I can comprehend this elemental exteriority within its interior world.  “Vision
is essentially an adequation of exteriority with interiority: in it exteriority
is reabsorbed in the contemplative soul and, as an <i>adequate idea</i>,
revealed to be a priori.”<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span

For Levinas, vision function as the ability to absorb alterity, the ultimate
power of the Same.  In addition to accommodating my power of sight, the house
allows me to maintain the invisibility of my interiority.  The house not only
provides a window through which I can look, it also provides a space in which I
can conceal myself from the outside world, from the element, from the totality,
and even from the gaze of the Other.  Like Gyges, the I who maintains the power
of vision can see everything while evading sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Whereas
the enjoying I constitutes the element only insofar as it is constituted by it,
the seeing I determines alterity without being determined by it.  The visual
sense therefore establishes a distinct type of relationship with the world. 
When I separate myself from the <i>there is</i>, I maintain the rest of the
world in this impersonal totality.  Levinas explains, “Thus appears the
structures of vision, where the relation of the subject with the object is
subordinated to the relation of the object with the void of openness, which is
not an object. ... To comprehend the particular being is to apprehend it out of
an illuminated sight it does not fill.”<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"

Sight relates to the world through the void, perceiving it as if it issued from
nothingness.  Whereas labor masters the element by stabilizing it, vision
dominates the objects which it comprehends.  Through this horizon of
generality, thematization surprises and captures existents within my world so
that they surrender themselves over to my consciousness.  The sovereign I
apprehends the word through its own points of view, ascribing significance to
objects according to the relations which it establishes between them.  Vision
perceives objects as phenomena, as mute entities which have no capacity to
respond to the imperialism of the Same.  The independence and resistance of the
world disappear within the consciousness which subsumes it.  Levinas explains
how sight suppresses and possesses the element by suspending its alterity, “The
most ponderous reality envisaged as an object of a thought is engendered in the
gratuitous spontaneity of a thought that thinks it. ... To represent is not to
reduce a past fact to an actual image but to reduce to the instantaneousness of
thought everything that seems independent of it.”<a href="#_ftn34"

suspending the threat of futurity, I reduce the world to the stasis of an
instant in which I maintain the unique power to constitute reality.  Furthermore,
the positing of an interior moment of the present separates me from the past. 
Just as Heidegger calls the stabilization of Being in a factical Situation an
existentially positive “capacity for delusion,” Levinas calls this achievement
of a pure present a “power for illusion.”<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

“At the very moment of representation the I is not marked by the past but <i>utilizes
</i>it as a represented and objective element.<i>  </i>Illusion?  Ignorance of
its own involvements?  Representation is the force of such an illusion and of
such forgettings.  Representation is the pure present.”<a href="#_ftn36"

For Heidegger, Dasein’s delusory absorption in its facticity distracts it from
the power it attains by accepting its heritage and projecting towards a
future.  Conversely, Levinas asserts that this illusory present establishes the
only true power that I maintain over my world, and that my connection with the
future and the past divest me of my virility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Integrating
all alterity into an identity and turning the world into the contents of a consciousness,
sight acts as the most important power which a free and sovereign interiority
can exercise over its world.  The development of vision therefore functions as
the consummation of my autonomy in the world.  By putting boundaries around
myself and stabilizing the <i>there is</i>, I make my interiority invisible to
the world while gazing out at it and referring it back to my own perceptual
horizons.  Like me, the Other maintains a visage through which he can see and
can hide her own alterity.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span

The visage of the Other manifests this invisibility.  “Inasmuch as the access
to beings concerns vision, it dominates those beings, exercises a power over
them ... The visage is present in its refusal to be contained ... It is neither
seen nor touched — for in visual or tactile sensation the identity of the I

The Other’s visage appears in my domicile as a body which, like other material
things, can be subsumed within my consciousness.  However, the visage’s
character as a sensible phenomenon doubles with a transcendent alterity which
always lies outside of the my horizons.  Beyond the Other’s appearance in my
present moment, the Other maintains the capacity to reappear in the
unforeseeable future.  Furthermore, the Other’s alterity can be understood as
the perspectival transformation of Levinas’ analysis of my interiority. 
Levinas’ statement that “the visage is present in its refusal to be contained”
echoes his notion that my psychism “opens under a force of resistance [it]
opposes to its totalization.”  My interiority enables me to separate myself
from impersonal <i>there is</i>  which would absorb and neutralize me.  Through
my separation, I convert the <i>there is </i>into a light through which I can
absorb exteriority.  The Other’s alterity arises as his resistance to the
totalization which my gaze attempts to impose upon him.<a href="#_ftn39"

He insists, “In the absolute, the subject and the object would still be parts
of the same system, would be enacted and revealed panoramically.  ...
Exteriority is true not in a lateral view apperceiving it in opposition to
interiority;  it is true in a face to face that is no longer entirely vision,

point separated from exteriority so radically that it maintains itself of

The face to face relation can only be understood from the perspective of an I
who looks at an Other who gazes back.  Like Heidegger, Levinas asserts that
this gnosis can not be understood existentially from the detached perspective
of a neutral third party who looks at it theoretically.  This panoramic viewpoint
would swallow up the Other and me into an impersonal totality, suppressing the
multiplicity of existents, eradicating the freedom of separated interiority,
and violating the transcendence of alterity.  This impersonal gaze asserts
itself by imposing a universal time upon the Other and me.  It freezes our
images in the historical moment of our deaths during which we can no longer
speak for ourselves.  However, because the conversation between the Other and
me propels us through spirals of death and rebirth, we maintain our capacity to
reply to this totalitarian violence.  By signifying himself through his speech,
the visage of the Other indicates that he can answer for the images which he
presents.  Levinas explains, “Speech is always a taking up again of what was a
simple sign cast forth by it, an ever renewed promise to clarify what was
obscure in the utterance.”<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span

The transcendence of the Other derives from his connection to an unforeseeable
future which can not be envisaged in a moment of vision.  This futurity allows
the Other the infinite capacity to revise the images which he presents in a
present instant.  Because the Other, as an interlocutor, directs and attends to
his appearance, he overflows the representation which I contain within my own consciousness.</p>

face-to-face relationship with the Other requires an I who possesses the full
powers of its selfhood.  Most importantly, this relationship requires an I who
maintains its power of sight.  Because the Other can not be fully absorbed
within the horizons of my consciousness, I perceive that the Other transcends
them.  Therefore, I must look upwards to see him.  That is, the relationship
with the Other requires a certain type of visual intentionality.  Levinas

mere thing, but as a <i>visage</i>, as a being which can see.  Levinas
explains, “Things manifest themselves as answering to a question relative to

a visage ... To aim at a visage is to put the question <i>who?</i> to the very

Heidegger’s emphasis upon the act of questioning for reducing all entities to
the neutral substratum of Being.  Against Heidegger, he asserts that whenever I
ask any question about entities, I must direct this question to my
interlocutor, the Other.  More significantly, the question asked <i>about</i>
the Other can not be answered by Being, but only by the Other.  Before I can <i>grasp</i>
the Other as a sensible content of my consciousness, the Other has already signified
himself as the one who can <i>donate</i> a<i> </i>response to his own
epiphany.  Before I can question the Other, the Other’s alterity has already
thrown my sovereign interiority into question.  </p>

pouvoir.”  He seems to use this phrase to critique Heidegger’s analysis of
Dasein as the projection of possibilities.  This French word “pouvoir” connotes
both “power” and “ability.”  Therefore, the deterioration of my power for power

possession; I can only attempt to murder him.  Levinas explains, “To kill is
not to dominate but to annihilate;  it is to renounce comprehension

[literally, “the evil language.”]  Traditionally, Judaism has condemned loshon
ha-ra because, in it, one speaks ill of another human being without giving this
person the opportunity to speak up for himself.  Levinas finds the Greek
correlate to this Jewish prohibition in the Platonic condemnation of rhetoric. 
He states, “Rhetoric, absent from no discourse, and which philosophical
discourse seeks to overcome, resists discourse.  ... It approaches the Other
not to face him, but obliquely — not, to be sure, as a thing, since rhetoric
remains conversation, and across all its artifices goes unto the Other,

I, through the rhetoric of my speech, impose my will upon the Other who has
silenced herself in order to listen to me.  For Levinas, ‘murder” seems to

person, to reduce this person to the conception one has of him without allowing
him to defend himself.  Murder forces the transcendent freedom of the Other
into a mute compliance.  Levinas states that this exceptional possibility of
murder is also the “most banal incident of human history.”<a href="#_ftn50"

reducing it to interiority paralyzes my power, putting my mastery over reality
into question.  Instead, the Other, as destitute, exercises her mastery over
me.  Levinas explains, “The nakedness of the visage is destituteness.  To

absence within the world I have created for myself.  Levinas describes this
estrangement as a nudity.  Because the Other reveals himself as exterior to my
consciousness, she enters into my realm without any concept protecting or
covering her.  The utterly straightforward relationship directly exposes the
Other to my hospitality and my violence.  Paradoxically, this very destitution
establishes the Other’s mastery over me.  Viewing the Other shows me a being
whose existence lies beyond the horizons of my own sovereign interiority, something
which can not be encompassed within or thematized by my consciousness.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
Other masters me by staring at me and calling my sovereign interiority into
question.  Levinas explains that the visage of the Other views my world from an
external perspective, making me feel ashamed of my quest to dominate the world
as my property.  He states, “The Other measures me with a gaze incomparable to
the gaze by which I discover him ... The relationship with the Other does not
move (as does cognition) into enjoyment and possession, into freedom; the Other
imposes himself as an exigency that dominates this freedom, and hence as more
primordial than everything that takes place in me.”<a href="#_ftn52"

The shame which the Other provokes in me requires me to reflect upon my own
possessiveness, enabling me to achieve self-consciousness.  In this description
of the Other’s mastery over me and of the development of self-consciousness,
Levinas seems to adapt Hegel’s analysis of the interaction between the slave
and bondsman.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span

Like Hegel, Levinas asserts that, in order to see oneself, one must look at
someone else who is regarding oneself.  However, Levinas departs from Hegel by
explaining the mastery of the Other as a teaching rather than a domination. 
Whereas I maintain my own self-subsistence by containing the world through my
grasp and my representational vision, the Other teaches me by showing me
something I could never deduce from or absorb within myself.  By exposing his
own exteriority, the Other teaches me that a world exists beyond the narrow
confines of my insular interiority.  The Other teaches me the idea of infinity
by inserting within my consciousness something which I could never contain by
my own power.  Finally, the gaze of the Other’s visage masters and teaches me
by obliging me to respond to him.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            In
order to understand fully the Other’s mastery over me, it is necessary to
explore what exactly constitutes her destitute absence from my world.  I
perceive the Other as an absence because I have excluded the Other from the
home I have created for my autochthonous existence.  I had established this
interiority by extracting myself as an individual from impersonal totalizing
structures.  By building the barriers of my domicile, I do not merely lock out
the Other; I slam the door on the rest of humanity.  The interiority of my
inner realm refuses the public sphere<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span

separating myself from the impersonal, general realm of the third party. 
Therefore, the destitution of the Other refers to the presence of humanity, of
all of the Others, in the visage of the singular Other.  Levinas asserts, “The
third party looks at me in the eyes of the Other — language is justice.  It is
not that there first would be the visage, and then the being it manifests or
expresses would concern himself with justice;  the epiphany of the visage qua
visage opens humanity.”<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span

Not only does the Other call me into question, the Other makes me responsible
to everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
presence of the third party in the visage of the Other instills a level of
equality within the face-to-face relationship.  Levinas states that “[The
Other’s] equality within this essential poverty consists in referring to the <i>third
party</i>, thus present at the encounter, whom in the midst of his destitution
of the Other already serves.  Because the visage of the Other refers to the
generality of humanity, its mastery also refers to me as an equal.”<a

The emergence of equality from the relationship with the transcendent Other can
be interpreted in several overlapping ways.  First of all, the third party
seems to appear as the sensible aspect of the Other.  Levinas explains that, in
the discursive exchange between the Other and me, “the visage that looks at it
places itself in the full light of the public order.”<a href="#_ftn57"

our conversation, I present an image and donate a word to the Other.  I do not
sacrifice my interiority, but rather give the Other a general thing which can
be accessed by anyone.  By questioning my right to possess the world in my
private interiority, the Other refers me to the public world of properties.<a

Not only does the Other accuse me as a property owner, the Other manifests
himself in a public light as one constituted by representable properties, as
one who is equal to me in his rights to own public property.  My perception of
myself as an equal also seems to be the effect of a play of perspectives. 
Levinas asserts that I see the masterful Other already serving.  Most
obviously, the Other’s servitude arises from her subjection to the public world
of property.  The Other seems to see me as an Other and therefore also sees
Others in my visage which command him to do justice to everyone.  Furthermore,
it would seem that the Other serves because the Other perceives me as his Other
and therefore views me as his master.  Because I already approach the Other as
a master, I perceive the Other’s servitude as referring back to the generality
of humanity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
perception of the Other’s transcendent servitude invests me with my sovereign
freedom.  The Other’s destitution masters me by teaching me her poverty and
exteriority.  However, the Other does not master me in order to make me
servile, but rather to make me into a master.  The gaze of the Other invests me
as a unique individual who has the power to administer to the needs of the Other
and the full responsibility to promote social justice.  Levinas explains that
“[The Other] joins me to himself for service.  He commands me as a master. 
This command can concern me only inasmuch as I am master myself;  consequently
this command commands me to command.”<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span

The notion that the command of the Other orders me to master myself seems to be
directed against the Kantian model of autonomy as a self-given law.  More
importantly, this statement seems to be directed against Heidegger’s
Nietzschean tendencies.  In <u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger, following
Nietzsche who himself follows the Stoics, embraces the model of Dasein as one
who resolutely masters its subjection to its heritage through an authentic
projection of its potentiality-for-Being.   In his 1936 lecture course on <u>Nietzsche: 
The Will to Power as Art</u>, Heidegger projects his concept of resoluteness
onto Nietzsche, stating, “[Willing] is the submission of ourselves to our own
command, and the resoluteness of such self-command.”<a href="#_ftn60"

Levinas’ assertion that the Other founds my self-mastery continues a critique
against Heidegger and Nietzsche which Levinas began in his 1934 essay
“Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism.”  In this essay, Levinas
distinguishes between two notions of mastery.  He explains that European
thought defines truth through the notion of universality.  Because an idea can
be detached from the person who proposes it and can be accepted by anyone, a
universal community of equals can all become masters of a true idea.  Even as early
as 1934, Levinas had already begun to explain mastery as an intellectual
mastery, as a teaching of public truths which founds a general community of
masters.  Conversely, Levinas explains that the German ideal, shared by
Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the Nazis, analyzes sovereignty and truth in terms of
a will to power.  They view mastery as a force located within the body of the
one who has force.  In this model, power does not separate from the one who
exerts it nor can it be appropriated by those who are subjected to it.<a

Instead of creating a community of equals, force establishes a world of
forceful masters and subjugated slaves.  This notion of truth as will to power
does not spread through dialogue, but rather universalizes itself through war
and conquest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            As
mentioned above, Levinas adapts Hegel’s notion that the self requires the gaze
of an Other to achieve self-consciousness.  Levinas states that the face to
face, “this moral experience, so commonplace, indicates a metaphysical
asymmetry:  <i>the radical impossibility of seeing oneself from the outside</i>
and of speaking of the same sense of oneself and of the others, and
consequently the impossibility of totalization.”<a href="#_ftn62"

Because I can never leap outside of myself to observe myself, I require the
perspective of the Other.  Levinas adapts the Cartesian model of the subject’s
relationship with God because, in this confrontation “the Cartesian subject is
given a point of view exterior to itself from which it can apprehend itself.”<a

The visage of the Other forces me to reflect upon myself and to pay attention
to my manifestation.  The epiphany of the Other presents me with a being
outside of the parameters of my own interior existence, a being with his own
independent consciousness.  The Other therefore requires me to establish a
distance between myself and my elemental existence.  By looking at me, the
Other breaks me out of my solipsistic, infantile enjoyment, enabling me to
establish my own powers of possession and vision.  Not only does the face to face
produce my relationship with the world of objects, it also produces my
relationship with myself.  Because the Other questions my sovereign possession
of my interiority, he both authorizes and challenges it.  To invest me with a
responsible freedom, the Other commands me to open up a critical eye to myself,
enabling me to attend to my existence <i>in</i> <i>view of</i> my
possibilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            In
this analysis of my self-mastery, Levinas seems to be thematizing the
production of the interior home from an external perspective.  In the pure
state of enjoyment, my existence does not differentiate itself from the
pulsation of the elemental milieu.  Therefore, the impersonal <i>there is</i>
always threatens to swallow up this enjoying I and negate its individuality. 
In order to separate myself from this insular state and from the threat of the
future, I found a home in which I can assert my sovereignty through possession
and representation.  The foundation of the domicile therefore seems to be
equivalent to the self-mastery which the I achieves through its relationship
with the Other’s visage.  Furthermore, Levinas explains that the intimacy with
the feminine Other is the precondition for the home.  He further asserts that
the Other’s manifestation of herself as an absence constitutes her femininity. 
Because Levinas also describes the Other’s masterful destitution as her absence
from my world, one can assume that the welcome of the feminine Other is
equivalent to the command of the destitute Other.  In both cases, the Other is
absenced, is silenced, so that I can posit itself in a masterful moment of
speech.  As will be shown below, Levinas describes the foundation of selfhood
from yet another perspective in his description of the erotic relationship
between the Other and me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas
also repeats the analysis of my foundation of my power of visual representation
from an exterior perspective.  Against the Kantian notion of representation,
Levinas explains that visual thematization comes from the intentionality of the
Other rather than my own solipsism.  He states, “Things acquire a rational
signification, and not only one of simple usage, because an other is associated
with my relations with them.  In designating a thing I designate it to the
Other.  The act of designating modifies my relation of enjoyment and possession
with things, places the things in the perspective of the Other.”<a

Because the gaze of the Other puts my enjoyment of the element into question, I
can separate myself from this infantile state.  I can detach myself from the relative
exteriority in order to grasp it as matter.  By questioning my possession of
the world, the visage of the Other detaches me from this matter so that I can
posit it as a set of objects.  The external viewpoint of the Other separates
this matter from my interiority, referring it to a public economy, referring it
to the Other as a donation.  Therefore, Levinas contends that I understand the
world through the mediation of the face-to-face encounter with the Other. 
Whereas Heidegger asserts that Dasein relates to phenomena through its own
comportment, its own hold on Being, Levinas maintains that I establish this
relationship through a vis-a-vis relationship with the visage.  Representation
does not derive from the thematizing work of an isolated ego, but already
depends upon the Other.  The critical light which the autosignifying visage
sheds determines an orientation and a signification for all phenomena.  Through
our rapport, the Other and I reveal a public world of property.  When I speak a
word or present an image, I do so for my interlocutor, the Other.  I enact my
power to represent as welcoming of the Other into my domicile and as donating
my gifts of communication to the Other.  Against Heidegger’s assertion that an
impersonal Being gives [<i>es gibt</i>] a world to Dasein, Levinas contends
that the world is established through the my giving [<i>donner</i>] and the
Other’s pardon [<i>pardonner</i>.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas’
analysis of the will demonstrates how even my existence as a for-myself depends
upon the Other.  His analysis of the will enables him to make his most radical
critique of the phenomenological, both Husserlian and Heideggerian, model of
intentionality,  I assert my sovereignty in the public, sensible world through
the exertion of my will.  I evade the threat of the unforeseeable future by
establishing my power in the world.  I create a domicile from which I can
stabilize the world as permanent possessions, to thematize it as objects, and
to communicate messages.  Through its labor, the will produces visible works from
which it absents its interiority.  This production exposes the will’s
sovereignty to outside influences.  For example, the bodily home which
preserves a private space for my interiority also posits me as a public,
visible object.  By willfully asserting myself in the sensible world, I open
myself up to the exploitation of the Other.  Levinas explains, “Every will
separates itself from its work. ... The other can dispossess me of my work,
take it or buy it, and thus direct my behavior;  I am exposed to instigation. 
The work is destined to this alien <i>Sinngebung</i> from the moment of its
origin in me.  It is to be emphasized that this destination of the work to a
history I cannot foresee — for I cannot see it — is inscribed in the very
essence of my power, and does not result from the contingent presence of other
persons alongside of me.”<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span

Because I absent myself from the works I create, Others can appropriate these
works and turn them against my original intention.  Although I may initially
project my will, the results of my deeds will be determined by an Other because
they will occur in a future which I can not foresee.  Against Heidegger,
Levinas insists that, due to the very nature of the will, an Other always leaps
in for me.  My existence is never adequate to my intentions because my
intentions are always taken over by an Other.  Every possibility which I
project escapes my own power.  When I donate all of my works to the Other, they
acquire their signification from the Other who receives them.  Because the will
posits its productions in a public, sensible realm, they expose the will to the
Other’s vision.  Although my interiority remains invisible, my labor
externalizes me as a collection of visible products, including my very body. 
In establishing my own sovereign self-consciousness, the will exposes me to the
thematization and objectification of a hostile Other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas
describes this alienation of my will by the Other as war and violence.  Rather
than positing the will as a heroic, self-asserting will-to power, he describes
it as something whose very constitution allows tyrannical violence to force it
into submission.  Through violence, the Other can subjugate the will by
appropriating its products.  Levinas explains, “The part of eternal truth that materialism
involves lies in the fact that the human will can be laid hold of in its works.
... The for itself of the will, unshakable in its happiness is exposed to
violence. ... The will essentially violable harbors treason in its own
essence.  It is not only offendable in its dignity ... but is susceptible of
being coerced and enslaved as a will, becoming a servile soul.”<a href="#_ftn66"

Because the Other can seize the will through its works, he can force it to play
a part in a historical fate which it hasn’t willed.  The existence of the body
articulates the sovereignty and the weakness of the human will.  The body
grounds me as a home from which I can assert power, but it also subjects me to
the subtle coercion and brutal torture of a murderous Other.   When the will
posits itself as its corporeality, it opens itself up to all of the possible
violence which can be done to a body, to the seduction of gold and to the
brutality of a gas chamber.  Relating to the Other through the public world of
impersonal works and general facts opens up the possibility of war.   Levinas’
description of violence and war must be read on several different levels. 
First of all, his account of the susceptibility of the will explains how and
why a human being can be degraded through brutality.   Levinas’ account of
persecution denies the reader the opportunity to romanticize the horror of
human suffering.  One could not achieve a similar understanding of the harsh,
material reality of oppression it one utilized a Heideggerian model of a will
which heroically asserts itself against its anxiety.<a href="#_ftn67"

Secondly, Levinas’ analysis of violence seems to describe an event in the
conversation between the Other and me.  He describes the Other as a <i>murderous</i>
Other who brings death upon me.  This would seem to suggest that Levinas is
here repeating his analysis of murder from the perspective of one who suffers
from it rather than of one who commits it.  Violence, war, and murder occur to
me at the end of my moment in time.  When I manifest myself in the instant in
my domicile, I externalize a sensible, concrete part of myself.  Just as I can
murder the sensible aspect of the Other, my body becomes general property which
the Other can seize.   By manifesting myself, I allow the Other to reduce me to
the mere image which I display or the mere word I give.  Because each statement
reduces the humanity of both the Other and me to an impersonal, public thing,
war arises from discourse.  Levinas states, “This discourse is therefore not
the unfolding of a prefabricated internal logic, but the constitution of truth
between thinkers, with all the risks of freedom.”<a href="#_ftn68"

Like Heidegger, Levinas makes struggle into an important phenomenological
category.  However, Heidegger describes struggle as the work of impersonal Being
which draws Daseins together for a common project or as a primordial conflict
between an impersonal Being and its There.  Conversely, for Levinas, struggle
produces this impersonal realm, the violent reductionism of the truth.  War
does not bring people together, but rather occurs between interlocutors who
always maintain their separate freedom from each other, from impersonal forces,
and from the struggle itself.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            I
suffer when the will of the Other forces me into a state of utter submission. 
Against Heidegger’s analysis of Dasein’s heroically resolute and anxious
Being-towards-Death, Levinas explains suffering as a fear and a fleeing away
from death.  Death is not a state which is my ownmost, but rather a murder
which the Other inflicts upon me.  Levinas explains, “The unforeseeable of
death is due to the fact that it does not lie within any horizon.   It is not
open to grasp.  It takes me without leaving me the chance I have in a
struggle.  In death I am exposed to absolute violence, to murder in the night.”<a

The language of this statement clearly directs itself against Heidegger’s claim
that authentic Dasein must seize and visually understand death as an authentic
possibility.  In <u>Time and the Other</u>, Levinas explains that death
represents not the possibility of the self’s impossibility, but rather the
impossibility of the self’s possibilities..  Death never lies within my
horizons because, when it arrives, I have already perished.  Instead, the
unforeseeable Other threatens me with something completely beyond my power.  In
suffering, that which completely escapes my power and vision, death, imposes
itself upon me.  This description of suffering again demonstrates the
perspectival character of Levinas’ argument.  As was discussed earlier, Levinas
describes suffering as a state which I already overcame and encompassed within
the enjoyment of my needs.  Whereas that account relates my retrospective
perspective at the (re)birth of my instant, Levinas here describes the my
perspective when I look forward to the imminent death of my instant.  Death
occurs when I, having been totally alienated from itself, become swallowed up
by the impersonal totality, the <i>there is</i>, which has been created in the
instant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas
explains that the impersonal events of history function as the graveyard for
these slaughtered wills.  He states, “Historiography recounts the way the
survivors appropriate the works of dead wills to themselves;  it rests on the

Through the impersonal truth of historical knowledge, survivors, people who
live over [<i>sur + vivre</i>] others, appropriate the works of the dead by
thematizing them.  History obscures my invisible interiority by transforming my
existence into something which can be viewed publicly.  It erases my
interiority as someone who acts within history because it does not allow me to
speak up for myself.  History recounts the objective details of my life in a
third-person narrative, forgetting that a human being, an I, actually existed
as these now-impersonal facts.  It describes how, during my death, my will was
manipulated by others while ignoring how, during my recurrent rebirths, I
struggled to reappropriate my sovereignty over my fate.  Although suffering
threatens me with my extermination, it does not totally eradicate my freedom. 
Levinas explains that, in order to make an individual suffer, one must degrade
him as an object while still allowing him just enough freedom to see this
subjugation.  The tiny margin of interior sovereignty which separates me from
my works makes me aware of my suffering and gives me a prevision of the
imminence of my death.  Cognizant of this inevitable violence, consciousness
avoids it.  Levinas explains,  “Things have a dominion over man, but to be a
man is to know that this is so and to desire the postponement of this inhuman
subjection.”<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span

I ultimately escape being reduced to historical data through my vision of the
unforeseeable future which lies beyond the visible present.  The will maintains
its autonomy by detaching itself from the works, words, and images which it
manifests in the instant.  By doing so, I do not remain committed to the
destiny which I project, but rather maintain the capacity to efface the
historical facts of my present moment and to renounce such commitments in a
future moment.</p>

resist the totality of history by reconstituting the invisibility of my
interiority.  Levinas defines invisibility as the offense which totalizing
systems inflict upon individuals by eradicating their particularity. Therefore,
my invisibility can not be <i>represented</i> as a visible event within
history, but rather can only be <i>expressed </i>as my personal communication
to the Other.  I escape death by presenting myself to the Other’s judgment, by
speaking up to the Other in order to request his pardon.   Levinas explains
this as a fundamentally ambiguous event, “The will, whose spontaneity and
mastery are belied by death, are stifled in a historical context, that is, in
the works that remain of them, of itself seeks to place itself under a
judgment, and to receive the truth from it upon its own witness.  ...  What is
this existence the will enters into, placing itself under a judgment that
dominates the apology, but does not reduce it to silence? ... The will seeks
judgment in order to be confirmed against death, whereas death taken as the
judgment of history kills the will qua will.”<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72"

This account of judgment demonstrates how truth becomes constituted by
struggle.  In order to defend itself from being reduced to a historical datum,
the will speaks to the Other, justifying itself as an individual which can
speak for itself.  However, by presenting itself to the Other as its
justification, the will allows the Other to reduce it to the words which it
speaks.  Yet I escapes this reduction by maintaining a conversation with the
Other.  I apologize<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span

the Other, speak to his transcendence, and the Other grants me a pardon,
listening to me and allowing me to defend myself by becoming reborn in a new
moment of speech.  I retain the invisibility of my own individuality through my
intercourse with the Other.  Because I can not gaze at my own particularity
from the outside, I must look at the Other who gazes back at me to reconstitute
my own interiority.  </p>

can not distinguish myself from a totality without viewing the gaze of the
Other which maintains a conversation with me and which allows me to speak.  The
destitution of the Other expresses to me the offense which impersonal, visible
history inflicts upon the invisibility of particularity.  Levinas states, “The
invisible offense that results from the judgment of history, a judgment of the
visible, will attest subjectivity to be prior to judgment or to be a refusal of
judgment;  if it is only produced as cry and protestation, if it is felt within
me.  But it is produced as judgment itself when it looks at me and accuses me

interiority is preserved by the accusation and the pardon of the Other.  By
accusing me of murder, the visage of the Other questions my imperialistic
possessiveness, wrenching me free of the world of impersonal properties and
enabling me to transcend the objectification of history.  Levinas states that
the Other who judges me does so as God who “does not silence by its majesty the
voice and the revolt of the apology.  God sees the invisible and sees without

Levinas description of God as the one who “sees without being seen” clearly
refers back to his discussions of Gyges.  The transcendent Other which judges
does so as a sovereign exteriority who always remains free from totalizing
history.  Although the Other’s gaze does murder my sensible aspect by reducing
me to my visible works, it does not turn me into a possession, into an object. 
The Other’s visage recognizes me as an interlocutor, pardoning me as a
sovereign, invisible interiority which always maintains the right to answer and
apologize for itself, and which, through a rebirth, can overcome its visible
historical manifestation.</p>

ultimate passivity which nonetheless turns into action and into hope, is <i>patience</i>

allowing myself to become radically vulnerable and submissive.  This death
allows me to become reborn as a new mastery, a mastery which will remember this

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            I
effect my relationship with the unforeseeable future through my erotic
relationship with the Other.  In the erotic relationship, the Other and I
ignore the public sphere in order to enter an intimate relationship with each
other.  For Levinas, eros seems to signify the event in which I absent myself
from historical works to encounter the feminine Other in her absence.  Levinas’
descriptions seem to imply that I encounter the erotic Other at the point of
both of our deaths.  At this point, the Other’s will has been totally converted
into sensible matter.  Unlike the Other in its aspect as an interlocutor, the
Other which has succumbed to this state of ultramateriality does not speak to
me.  However, this husk of the Other does not merely appear a mute object;  her
overwhelming corpse testifies to an alterity which has totally absented itself
from her manifestation.  In this epiphany, I confront the unforeseeable future
as well as death.  This clandestine relationship of our absent interiorities
drastically alters the nature of our specular face-to-face.  As discussed
before, I illuminate a world for myself through the labor which stabilizes the
element as matter.  However, Levinas explains that the Beloved lies beyond my
power:  she can not be grasped, only caressed.  “The caress consists in seizing
upon nothing, in soliciting what ceaselessly escapes its form toward a future
never future enough, in soliciting what slips away as though it <i>were not yet</i>... 
It <i>searches</i>, it forages.  It is not an intentionality of disclosure but
of search:  a movement unto the invisible.”<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77"

In the caress, I attempt to touch the Other in her absence, searching after the
invisible privacy of her alterity.  Throughout our conversation, the Other
remains transcendent because, during every moment that he expresses itself, she
refuses to completely reveal herself, thus retaining the capacity to express
something completely new in the unforeseeable future. Unlike Dasein’s
anticipation which foresees and grasps possibilities, my caress has no horizon
within which I can take hold of the future inserted into the present, the <i>not
yet</i>.  Instead the Lover ceaseless gropes after its Beloved, searching for
something which, by definition, dissolves into nothing.  Levinas explains how
this search disrupts my power of vision.  “<i>The essentially hidden throws
itself toward the light, without becoming signification</i>..”<a href="#_ftn78"

continues, “To discover here means to violate, rather than disclose a secret
... The shame of profanation lowers the eyes that should have scrutinized the
uncovered.  <i>An intentionality without vision</i>, discovery does not shed
light:  what it discovers does not present itself as <i>signification</i> and
illuminates no horizon.  The visage of the beloved ... expresses only the
refusal to express.” <a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span

Levinas states that the lover profanes her secrecy by expressing the fact that
she possesses a secret which she will not express.  This secret can not signify
anything for me because signification depends upon a present Other who can
speak for himself.  Like the Black Monolith in Stanley Kubrik’s <i>2,001</i>,
the epiphany of the lover exposes the existence of a mystery without giving
even a hint about its solution.  Her mortality indicates that <i>something</i>
lies beyond death, but I have no idea what this might be.  Eros reveals
violently by exposing me to the epiphany of the Other’s absence, tearing from
her the thing which she conceals entirely from the visible horizon, the privacy
of her alterity.  However, I do not relate this to a meaningful light.  The
Beloved’s exposure does not disclose her as a thematizable object, but rather
exhibits the very fact that her unforeseeable mystery, her presence as an
absent futurity in the present, can not be penetrated by sight.  Whereas
Heidegger’s Dasein bravely stares into nothingness, into its guilt of
not-being-the-basis-of-itself, Levinas’ “I” lowers its eyes shamefully at its
lover’s profanation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Levinas’
description of eros seems to indicate that my intercourse with the Other makes
copulation impossible.  Against all neo-Platonic or mystical descriptions of
love, he insists upon the impossibility of a union with the beloved.<a

the intimacy of love, as in the opposition of war, the Other maintains her
transcendent alterity, remaining outside of my horizons and preventing any
dialectical fusion.  The mystical notion of truth has heavily influenced
traditional Western models of truth and of Being.  Levinas’ critique of
copulation also seems to demonstrate that the copula is impossible.<a

Always maintaining absolute separation, my relationship with the Other occurs
neither as a logical joining of subject and predicate nor as a gathering  of
Dasein and Being.  Whereas most traditional philosophy presents truth as
something clean and clear, Levinas references to “ultramateriality” and a
“sublime materiality” seem to imply that the taint of materiality always weighs
down its production.  Levinas seems to suggest that, although impersonal truths
are produced from the sensible, historical corpses of the Other and me, this
very materiality prevents them from being completely melded into a meaningful
truth.  Levinas refers to the Other as the signifier because he signifies his
own alterity in a sensible word that both expresses him and kills him.  The
signifier can not be reduced to a pure meaning because, having his own
irreducible materiality, his embodiment resists assimilation into a systematic
totality.  Similarly, the true sentence which I utter to speak up against
history in defense of my own interiority is produced as a death sentence, but
the stench of my corpse<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><span

an impersonal public truth from erasing me.  Furthermore, this corpse which

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
materiality congealed in death becomes reborn as a new moment of sensuous
pleasure, a residue which prevents any fusion between the lover and the
Beloved.  Levinas’ narrative of my suffering and death and his description of
the erotic relationship with the Other seem to flesh out his analysis of the
newly-born enjoying I from a new perspective.  Just as imminence of death
causes me to suffer, Levinas states that the enjoying I feels insecurity at the
<i>there is</i> which threatens to invade it from the unforeseeable future.  In
order to forestall this threat, I separate myself by putting up the barriers of
my home.  This separation from the element echoes my detachment from the world
of impersonal works.  Just as I submerge myself in the element, the effeminized
Lover loses herself in her compassionate rapport with her Beloved.  Levinas
explains that, like the enjoying I, the erotic I becomes both master and slave,
possessing the Other in so far as I am possessed by the Other.  Just as the
enjoying I derives happiness from my past suffering, the extreme passivity of
the erotic I transforms my suffering into passion of voluptuosity.  “Wholly
passion, it is compassion for the passivity, the suffering, the evanescence of
the tender.  It dies with this death and suffers with this suffering. Being
moved, suffering without suffering, it is consoled already, complacent in its
suffering.  Being moved is a pity that is complacent, a pleasure, a suffering
transformed into happiness— voluptuosity.”<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84"

Lastly, the absence of the Other in my erotic intimacy seems to correlate with
the absent feminine intimacy which enables me to establish an interior
domicile.  Given the similarity of these descriptions, it seems that, for
Levinas, eros acts as the womb, “the tranquil eternity of its seminal or uterine
existence,”<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><span

ultimately escape death through my fecund reproduction of a new interiority. 
From the erotic relationship emerges a son who recommences my existence yet
exists apart from me.  My death in the moment transforms into a rebirth of an
Other who inhabits a new moment.  I relate to my futurity through a son who is
both different than and the same as me.<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86"

Unlike the Heideggerian future which Dasein seizes and sees, the birth of the
son lies beyond my vision and grasp.  I neither exert a power over nor project
the son because he leads an existence separate from mine.  Similarly, the son
emerges from a futural world that lies beyond my power of vision.  The
production of the son therefore marks the end of my character as a virile
subject of knowledge and power.  In addition to bringing out the feminine
aspect of the Other, the erotic encounter also effeminizes me.  The Lover does
not exert his selfhood through a masculine projection of its ownmost Being, but
rather she is moved by the pull of the future.  Rather than thrusting myself
towards the future, the erotic relationship initiates me into it.  Reproduction
therefore enables me to escape the closed circle of my own identity.   Levinas
critiques Heidegger’s notion of destiny because it makes resolute Dasein both
the master and the slave of fate.  By rejuvenating myself as a son, I do not
have to remain committed to the intentions which I had willed and which had
been taken over by Others.  The son who is both the same and Other than me can
reappropriate that which its father had created, overcome the image which he
had manifested, and answer for the words which he had spoken.  Most
importantly, the reborn I possesses the power to renounce my past, to repent
for my deeds, and to apologize to the Other. </p>

sense of alienation in a similar manner.  This notion of an inner connection
between modernism and Gnosticism seems quite suggestive.  Many modernist
writers, such as Carl Jung and Harold Bloom, have embraced gnosticism and
mysticism as alternative modes of knowing and as solutions to modern
existential problematics.  Indeed, there has been a great deal of intercourse
between existentialist thinkers and students of mysticism.  For example, Henri
Corbin, best known for his work on Sufism, was the first writer to translate
sections of <u>Being and Time</u> into French.  This connection between
modernism and mysticism also raises the question of whether any rapport exists
between Levinas and the kabbalist Isaac Luria.  What could the relationship be
between Levinas’ idea of the infinite and the Lurianic notion of the emanation
of the Godhead?  Could Levinas’ analysis of the absencing of the Other which
gives birth to a domiciled self be modeled on Luria’s doctrine that God absents
himself from the world to allow for man’s existence?  I would claim that Luria
acts as the foundational modern thinker for Judaism, determining Jewish
modernism in the same way that Luther determined Christian modernism.  If this
statement can be accepted, then is it possible that Levinas consciously

style='font-family:Times'>  By making this statement, I would like to raise the
question of which philosopher can be regarded as the “true heir” of Nietzsche’s
legacy.  The notion of a true heir is, of course, problematic, especially for a
fecund thinker such as Nietzsche.  It has been said that every philosopher has
his or her own reading of Nietzsche.  Nevertheless, it seems fruitful to
compare Nietzsche’s influence on Heidegger and Levinas. Throughout his work, Heidegger
seems to suggest that he somehow carries the thought of Nietzsche to its
logical conclusion.  Indeed, it seems that Heidegger has been privileged as a
reader of Nietzsche:  throughout the 1980s, the composite phrase
“Nietzschean-Heideggerian” was widely used to describe, for example,
hermeneutics and deconstruction.  [In the 1990s, however, Derrida and his
readers have drawn attention to Levinas’ influence on deconstruction.]  For me,
however, Heidegger’s texts has always seemed like readings of Nietzsche which
have deleted the joy, the pleasure, and the humor  of the Nietzschean text. 
This sentiment seems to be borne out by Heidegger’s erasure of the Dionysian
aspects of Nietzsche’s thought in his Nietzsche lectures.  Could a Jew succeed
where a Greek never could in reappropriating the reflections of Nietzsche?  By
embracing notions such as recurrence and enjoyment, could Levinas be answering
and continuing Nietzsche’s questions regarding morality?  It seems that the key
text for this comparison would be, as before, <u>Beyond Good and Evil</u>, p.
185.</span></p>

style='font-family:Times'>  As will be discussion below, the femininity of the
Other refers to several features of the self’s relationship to the Other. 
Levinas describes femininity as the “withdrawal and absence” of the Other. 
This seems to refer to:  1.  the Other as the mother of the newly birthed I; 
2.  the Other as the one who accommodates me, listens to me, and accepts my
gifts [my words];  3.  the Other as the recipient of my erotic Desire; 4. the
Other as the one who hides herself in her interiority from manifesting itself
in the present; and  5. The Other as the self’s wife.  This “marriage”
signifies that I have gone beyond my infantilism and have become a man. 
Although each aspect of the Other’s femininity can be viewed separately, all of
these coincide in the Other’s manifestation and harmonize with the male
attributes of the Other.  Finally, it should be noted that, at certain times in
our relationship and from certain perspectives, I take upon these feminine
traits in relation to the Other.</span></p>

he asks Meno “Do you suppose then that [the student] would have attempted to
look for, or learn, what he thought he knew, though he did not, before he was
thrown into a perplexity, became aware of his ignorance, and felt a desire to
know?” [84c]  The Levinasian motifs of teaching as critique and knowledge as
motivated by desire already appear in this Eleatic text.</span></p>

style='font-family:Times'>  Levinas connects the Other’s absence to both the
femininity of the Other and to the presence of the public realm in the Other. 
Therefore, it seems that Levinas transitively relates femininity with the
public world.  This correlation seems quite important for male modernists.
Whereas traditional societies tend to model the home as a feminine realm and
the realm of public exchange as masculine, Nietzsche continually warns of the
effemination caused by the mob mentality.   Heidegger, in <u>Introduction to
Metaphysics</u> critiques Russia and America for bringing about the <i>Entmachtung
</i> of the spirit.  Although this term might be translated more accurately as
“disempowerment” (Derrida translates it as “destitution,”) Manheim suggestively
translates it as “emasculation.”  Also, Heidegger’s reference to the “pincers”
of mass culture which trap Germany can also be taken as a metaphor of
castration.</span></p>

French term “propre” can be used against the German term “Eigen.”  “Property”
in this sense connotes ownership, that over which I maintain my exclusive
power;  2.  “Property” connotes my sojourn in the home as economic as well as
my economic exchange with the Other;  3.  Philosophically, a property refers to
a categorical quality which a subject possesses.  By reintroducing this notion,
Levinas could oppose Heidegger’s condemnation of categorical ontology and of
its division between subject and predicate.</span></p>

good that the mortal does all it can to put on immortality.  And how can it do

being the same so long as he continues to exist in the same form, and therefore
assume that a man is the same person in his dotage as in his infancy, yet, for
all we call him the same, every bit of him is different, and every day he is
becoming a new man, while the old man is ceasing to exist, as you can see from
his hair, his flesh, his bones, his blood, and the rest of his body.   And not
only his body, for the same thing happens to his soul.</span></p>
