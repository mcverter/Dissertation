<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Throughout
his philosophical career, Martin Heidegger has argued that Western philosophy
has erred in the way it has brought Being to light.   Like the works of
traditional philosophers, his <u>Being and Time</u> consistently describes the
philosophical quest as one which depends upon illumination and vision.  For
example, Heidegger explains that one must interrogate one’s everyday conception
of Being in order to discover its true ontological meaning by stating, “This
‘presupposing’ of Being has rather the character of taking a look at it
beforehand, so that in the light of it the entities presented to us get
provisionally articulated in their Being”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
In this and many other statements, Heidegger defines the researcher as the one
who looks and the object of his research as something which is limited by the
light in which it is viewed.  According to Heidegger, all viewpoints, all
sources of illumination, and all phenomena are limited by their finitude.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[2]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
However, by “clarifying” the “obscuration”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> imposed
upon a phenomenon, one can grasp its finitude authentically.  Heidegger bases
his philosophical methodology on his own interpretation of Husserl’s
phenomenology as a continuation of Greek thought.  He explains that, for the
Greeks, “‘phenomenon’ signifies that which shows itself in itself, the
manifest.  Accordingly the <span style='font-family:Symbol'>fainomenon</span>
or ‘phenomena’ are the totality of what lies in the light of day or can be
brought to light - what the Greeks sometimes identified simply with <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>ta</span> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>onta</span>
(beings.)”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[4]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
This preliminary methodological statement already contains the kernel of
Heidegger’s critique of traditional ontology.  Typically, philosophers such as
Plato have distinguished the momentary appearances of a being from an invisible
essence<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[5]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> which
enables it to exist.  Against this, Heidegger suggests that the Being of a
being depends upon the way it visibly manifests itself in the light of Being. 
He explains that just as phenomena can show themselves as what they are, they
can also show themselves as what they are not, as semblances.  That is, a
phenomenon can become obscured by misunderstandings such that it can no longer
be seen properly.  Having described the first half of the word “phenomenology,”
Heidegger turns to the second.  Heidegger asserts that the Greeks defined the
discourse of <span style='font-family:Symbol'>logoV</span> (logos) as <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>apofainesaV</span> (apophanasis,) a process which
lets something be seen.  Through this interpretation of logos, Heidegger posits
all verbal discourse, especially philosophical discourse, as serving a visual
function.  Taken together, Heidegger defines his phenomenological method as one
which clears the veils from semblances in order “to let that which shows itself
be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from itself.”<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            In <u>Being
and Time</u>, Heidegger attempts to bring to light the most primordial
phenomenon, <i>Dasein</i>.  Heidegger explains that Being should not be posited
as a transcendental substance which subsists outside of human existence. 
Rather, he insists that human beings are Dasein, existing literally as the
There [<i>Da</i>] where Being [<i>Sein</i>] occurs, where the temporal destiny
of the world is enacted.  Heidegger’s effort to shed light upon human existence
derives from his understanding of Dasein as the <i>Lichtung</i> for Being.  The
German term “Lichtung” translates into English as “clearing,” in the sense of a
clearing in the middle of a forest.  Heidegger draws upon this definition
especially in later writings such as his <i>Holzweges</i> (“ways through the
woods”), when he describes the thinker as one who finds a path through the
forest.  Furthermore, one creates a clearing in a forest so that one can
inhabit that space.  Therefore, the term Lichtung seems to be correlated with
Heidegger’s description of Dasein as one who dwells in Being and as one who
produces a region for dwelling. Lastly, Heidegger exploits the lexical
relationship between Lichtung and the term for light, <i>Licht</i>.  Heidegger
states, “To say that it is ‘illuminated’ means that as Being-in-the-world, it
is cleared in itself, not through any other being, but in such a way that it is
the clearing [Lichtung.]”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[7]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
In this statement, Heidegger asserts that Dasein’s capacity to grasp itself and
its world through vision does not emanate from an external source.  Rather, the
light which gives Dasein the possibility to do so derives from Dasein’s own
character as the cleared space in which the duration of Being manifests
itself.  If Dasein, as the There of Being, exists as light, this would seem to
suggest that Being itself is the production of light.  Although, in his later
works, Heidegger seems to equate the process of Truth-as-uncovering with Being,
<u>Being and Time</u> does not yet specify the relationship which obtains
between Being and light. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            By
locating light within Dasein, Heidegger opposes the traditional philosophical
conception of truth.  Western philosophers have tended to ground truth in an
transcendental source of light.  For example, Plato, in the <u>Republic</u>,
argues that everyday entities derive their truth from ideas just like objects
owe their visibility to the luminosity of the sun.<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  In
his <u>Meditations on First Philosophy</u>, Descartes argues that the natural
light and the benevolent omnipotence of God provide a guarantee that an
isolated subject can acquire certain knowledge about objects.  Heidegger
severely criticizes these models of truth for radically separating the
components of truth.  In particular, he argues against the notion that truth
arises from the transcendental agreement which connects the true assertion of a
subject with a true objective fact.  Against this tradition, Heidegger argues
that philosophical truth depends upon the way that Dasein, as the <i>Lichtung</i>
of Being, discloses its own light.  Heidegger states, “In so far as Dasein <i>is
</i>its disclosedness essentially, and discloses and uncovers as something
disclosed to this extent it is essentially ‘true.’”<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
More directly, Heidegger states, “Because the kind of Being that is essential
to truth is of the character of Dasein, all truth is relative to Dasein.”<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;top:0pt'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Rather than subsisting as a transcendental quality, Heidegger asserts that
Dasein produces the truth of its There through the way that it exists in its
There.   Dasein uncovers entities according to the way that it involves itself
in the world.  For example, only because a Dasein approaches the matter which
collects in its belly button as lint can it ever make a true statement such as
“there is lint in my belly button.”  Not only does Dasein establish the truth
of entities through this process of uncovering, Dasein discloses the truth of
its own existence through the manner in which it approaches this existence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            In addition
to arguing that Dasein exists as the only entity in which Being manifests
itself, Heidegger further asserts that it is the only one which has the
capacity to understand Being.  Just as disclosure provides a source of light
for Dasein and perhaps for Being itself, this activity of understanding acts as
the ground of vision.  Heidegger explains, “In its projective character,
understanding goes to make up existentially what we call Dasein’s “<i>sight</i>.”
... [The expression ‘sight’] corresponds to the “clearedness” which we took as
characterizing the disclosedness of the “there.”  In giving an existential
signification to “sight,” we have merely drawn upon the peculiar feature of
seeing, that it lets beings which are accessible to it be encountered unconcealedly
in themselves.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
Just as Heidegger follows traditional philosophers by grounding truth in light,
he similarly asserts that the self establishes all of its relationships with
the world through sight.  Opposing the spectatorial tradition, Heidegger contends
that the existential capacity of understanding does not merely observe beings
which independently subsist in the world.   Rather, Dasein always directs its
vision back at its own disclosedness.  In the above citation, Heidegger states
that Dasein’s vision “corresponds” to its disclosedness, but does not specify
the nature of this correspondence.  However, he also explains, “With the
disclosedness of the “there,” this sight is existentially; and Dasein <i>is </i>this
sight equiprimordially...” <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[12]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
This seems to suggest that, for Heidegger, Dasein’s vision is existentially
equivalent to the light in which it can see.  Like Aristotle who proposed that
knowledge was produced from the unity of the knower, the knowing, and the
known, Heidegger describes truth as something which is produced through a
knowing by a knower who is also the known.  This conception of truth and
understanding grounds Heidegger’s phenomenological methodology.  Because
Heidegger, as a Dasein, is a source of the light of disclosure and can light up
the truth through understanding, he can question the true meaning of Being and
of Dasein.  He can bring the Being of Dasein to light precisely because Dasein
exists as light.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger’s
most important deviation from the spectatorial tradition derives from the
correlation he always draws between Dasein’s vision and its self-assertion. 
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, many — if not all — thinkers have
correlated knowledge and power.  For example, many of the arguments in the <u>Republic</u>
rest upon the parallels which Plato draws between the individual faculty of
reason and political sovereignty.  Similarly, Descartes’ effort to secure a
stable foundation for thought seems to be driven by his desire to overcome the
external contingencies which threaten his knowledge with impotence.  Although
these philosophers implicitly associate knowledge and power, most of them also
argue that the quest for truth is an almost spiritual activity in which the
knower detaches itself from worldly struggles for power.  Heidegger’s
epistemological paradigm, however, seems to follow Nietzsche’s correlation of
perspectives and wills to power by intimately connecting the truth and the
power of the individual Dasein.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[13]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
In contrast to traditional epistemology which attempts to posit an external
source of light, Heidegger argues that Dasein’s self-illumination, its
disclosedness, acts as the medium where truth is established, where phenomena
manifest themselves, and ultimately where the activity of Being itself takes place. 
Dasein clarifies or obscures its disclosedness through the way that it develops
its understanding of itself.  Since Descartes, philosophy has discussed
understanding as a process through which an isolated knower achieves its
awareness of the world external to it.  Whereas the Cartesian model defines
understanding as the activity of a detached, if not disinterested, spectator,
Heidegger defines it as the way in which Dasein engages and asserts itself in
the world.  Heidegger defies Cartesian epistemology by defining understanding
as the way in which Dasein cares for the possible ways that it can exist, its
potentiality-for-Being.  He explains, “<i>Understanding is the existential
Being of Dasein’s own potentiality-for-Being; and it is so in such a way that
this Being discloses in itself what its Being is capable of</i>.”<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[14]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Understanding is not merely one activity among many, but rather the foundation
for all of Dasein’s activities.  For Heidegger, Dasein’s understanding of its
possibilities is the very basis of its existence and the most primordial
characterization of its Being.  “Possibility as an <i>existentiale</i> is the
most primordial and ultimate positive way in which Dasein is characterized
ontologically”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            The
language which Heidegger uses when he discusses understanding demonstrates the
connection which he makes between knowledge and power.  Throughout <u>Being and
Time</u>,  his usage of visual metaphors tends to double with terminology
connoting a virile thrust or grasp.  In the quote cited above, Heidegger states,
“In its projective character, understanding goes to make up existentially what
we call Dasein’s “<i>sight</i>.””<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
The spectatorial paradigm posits a viewer who observes phenomena from a
detached perspective.  In contrast, Heidegger asserts that understanding acts
as an engaged vision which “projects” [<i>Entwerfen</i>] or “throws” [<i>werfen</i>]
the possibilities of Dasein into the future.  Through this understanding,
Dasein asserts its power in and over the world, existing for-the-sake-of its
own potentiality-for-Being, giving it the freedom to choose its own Being. 
Heidegger characterizes Dasein’s existence as the past, present, and future
temporality of its self-projection.  He states, “Any Dasein has, as Dasein,
already projected itself; and as long as it is, it is projecting.  As long as
it is, Dasein always has understood itself and always will understand itself in
terms of possibilities.”  In addition to describing understanding as
projection, Heidegger discusses it as a grasp.  According to Heidegger, Dasein
grasps the possibilities it projects and projects the possibilities it grasps. 
As with projection, Heidegger explicitly assimilates vision and this grasp. 
Whereas traditional philosophers tend to describe the self’s relation to the
world as a visual perspective, Heidegger’s term for Dasein’s relationship
towards Being, comportment [<i>Verhalten</i>, from <i>halten</i>, to hold,]
suggests that this visual orientation doubles as a virile grasp which
appropriates what it sees.  Furthermore, Heidegger states, “The idea of grasping
and explicating phenomena in a way which is ‘original’ and ‘intuitive’ is
directly opposed to the <i>naiveté </i>of a haphazard, ‘immediate,’ and
unreflective ‘beholding.’”<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
In this statement, Heidegger directly contrasts the understanding which grasps
with the visual paradigm of Cartesian epistemology.  Authentic Dasein does not
stand back to observe phenomena, but rather engages itself in the possibilities
which it discloses to itself.  By seizing these possibilities in its own manner
and projecting itself upon them, Dasein brings its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being to light.  Heidegger asserts, “The sight which is
related primarily and on the whole to existence we call “<i>transparency.</i>” 
We choose this term to designate ‘knowledge of the Self;’ in a sense which is
well understood so as to indicate that here it is not a matter of perceptually
tracking down and inspecting a point called the “Self,” but rather of seizing
upon the full disclosedness of Being-in-the-world <i>throughout all</i> the
constitutive items which are essential to it, and doing so with understanding.”<a

Against Descartes, Heidegger insists that selfhood should not be considered an
Archimedian point of certainty or an Albertinian point of perspective.  Rather,
Dasein’s existence articulates itself through the manifold relationships it
constitutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Because
Dasein receives the disclosure of its possibilities from the throw [<i>wurf</i>]
of its projection [<i>entwurf</i>], it experiences this self-disclosure as its
thrownness [<i>Geworfenheit</i>] in its There.  Whereas Heidegger defines
understanding as a <i>seizure</i> of possibilities, he states that a thrown
state of mind “assails” [<i>uberfallen</i>]<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"

Dasein.  Whereas Heidegger describes projection as Dasein’s virile grasp, he
consistently describes thrownness as Dasein’s existential submission or
surrender to the world.  Heidegger explains this submission in his discussion
of the moods which reveal Dasein’s thrownness.  “<i>Existentially, a
state-of-mind implies a disclosive submission to the world, out of which we can
encounter something that matters to us.</i>”<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"

In thrownness, Dasein becomes receptive to the possibilities which it discloses
to itself.  Just as Dasein asserts its thrust towards its future through its
self-projection, it receives this thrust submissively as its having-been-thrown
in the past into a factical set of circumstances.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'> 
</span>As a state of surrender which opens Dasein to influences, thrownness
presents Dasein with the possibility of either affirming the potency of its own

world.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger’s
analysis of thrownness as a existential condition of receptivity rather than
assertiveness seems to be correlated with his description of it as a source of
darkness.  Although thrownness discloses the Being of Dasein in a certain
light, an impenetrable shadow surrounds this light.  He explains “In having a
mood, Dasein is always disclosed moodwise as that entity to which it has been
delivered over in its Being; and in this way it has been delivered over to the
Being which, in existing, it has to be”<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"

In contrast to his descriptions of understanding, Heidegger here discusses
thrownness in the passive voice.  Through this existential condition, Dasein
receives the imperative of its own existence which it must accept.   Beyond
this bare fact, Dasein can not divine what the source of this existence might
be.  Heidegger continues, “The pure ‘that it is’ shows itself, but the “whence”
and the “whither” remain in darkness.”<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

Therefore, the passiveness of thrownness seems to disclose the limit of
Dasein’s capacity to visually understand Being.  Heidegger asserts that Dasein
does not <i>perceive </i>its own mood, but rather <i>finds itself</i> in a
mood.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span

Not only does thrownness deny Dasein of its visual agency, this condition
subjects it to the gaze of the world.  Heidegger explains, “The mood brings
Dasein before the ‘that-it-is’ of its ‘there,’ which, as such, <i>stares it in
the face</i> with the inexorability of an enigma.”<a href="#_ftn24"

with the detached viewer, the spectatorial model posited the world as an
objective, subsistent reality for the knower to contemplate.  Therefore,
Heidegger’s notion that understanding does not merely observe the world, but
rather involves Dasein in it, requires that he rethink the Being of this
world.  Heidegger explains that Dasein approaches the world of its thrown There
through the concern which it feels for the entities manifested in this There.

hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become,
and the more unveiledly it is encountered — as equipment.”<a href="#_ftn25"

This statement demonstrates how Heidegger’s critique of traditional
epistemology correlates with his novel approach to ontology.  Against the
notion that entities exist independently as things-in-themselves or through the
transcendental forms which ground their Being, Heidegger asserts that the
existence of entities is defined through and as Dasein’s access to them.  “The
kind of Being which equipment possesses — in which it manifests itself in its
own right — we call “<i>readiness-to-hand</i>””<a href="#_ftn26"

According to Heidegger, Dasein approaches entities as “ready-to-hand”, as
already referred to the power of its grasp.  A modality of visual
understanding, circumspection, guides Dasein’s seizure of the Being of
entities.  Heidegger explains, “[Using and manipulating things] has its own
kind of sight by which our manipulation is guided and from which it acquires
its specific Thingly character.  Dealings with equipment subordinate themselves
to the manifold assignments of the ‘in-order-to.’  And the sight which they
thus accommodate themselves is circumspection [<i>Umsicht.</i>]”<a

Through the vision of circumspection, Dasein subordinates these entities to the
function which they can serve.  Dasein discloses these ready-to-hand entities
by letting them be involved in its world as things which it can use
for-the-sake-of realizing its own potentiality-for-Being.  For example, Dasein
frees the existence of a door because this portal already refers to Dasein’s
capacity to go through it.  Furthermore, Heidegger explains that Dasein does
not only perceive isolated pieces of equipment, but rather sees how all
entities are referred towards a totality of tools which ultimately refer to
their serviceability for Dasein.  Because the appearance of entities ultimately
depends upon how Dasein has projected its understanding of its possibilities,
Heidegger defines the Being of the totality of the world as that which Dasein
can seize for its own purposes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger
explains that Dasein can grasp this world through circumspection because it has
already disclosed this world through its interpretation.  Heidegger explains
that interpretation is the underlying character of understanding itself. 
Dasein articulates its understanding of its thrown condition through its
interpretation of its There.  Heidegger discusses interpretation using the
terminology both of vision and of the grasp of power.  According to Heidegger,
interpretation is grounded upon a threefold structure of a fore-having, a
fore-seeing, and a fore-conception which appropriates, views, and grasps the
interpreted entity in advance.  Similarly, he states, “As understanding, Dasein
projects its Being upon possibilities.  This <i>Being-towards-possibilities</i>
which understands is itself a potentiality for Being and it is so because of
the way these possibilities, as disclosed, exert their counter-thrust upon
Dasein ... This development of understanding we call “interpretation.””<a

position:relative;top:0pt'>[28]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
Through interpretation, Dasein appropriates the possibilities which have been
disclosed to it by receiving the thrust of its thrownness in order to project
itself, by using its submission to the world in order to promote its own self-assertion. 
Heidegger similarly explains, “To say that “circumspection discovers” means
that the ‘world’ which has already been understood comes to be interpreted. 
The ready-to-hand comes <i>explicitly</i> into the sight which understands.”<a
href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

By stating that this world <i>has</i> <i>already been</i> understood, Heidegger
implies that the disclosed light which grants Dasein the possibility of
understanding has itself been projected by a previous understanding.  Heidegger
explains how interpretations light up the world of concern by establishing
signs.  He states, “The peculiar character of signs as equipment becomes
especially clear in ‘establishing a sign.’  This activity is performed in
circumspective fore-sight out of which it arises and which requires that it be
possible for one’s particular environment to announce itself for circumspection
at any time by means of something ready-to-hand and that this possibility
itself should be ready-to-hand.”<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span

The disclosure of Dasein’s thrown world of circumspection depends upon the way
that it has projected its interpretation of the world.  Dasein’s foresight sets
up signs which function as ready-to-hand pointers which let other ready-to-hand
entities become accessible to the grasp and vision of Dasein.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Dasein’s
proximity to the world of its concern tends to cause it to obscure its Being. 
Through signs, Dasein circumspectively orients itself towards the equipmental
totality of its involvement as a spatial “region” for its dwelling.  Heidegger
describes Dasein’s circumspective absorption in this region as a state of
delusion.  He explains, “[There is an] existentially positive character of the
capacity for delusion.  It is precisely because we see the ‘world’ unsteadily
and fitfully in accordance with our moods that the ready-to-hand shows itself
in its specific worldhood, which is never the same from day to day.”<a

Dasein can understand these entities authentically in their temporary,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            According
to Heidegger, Dasein’s existential character of fallenness tends to cause it to
conceal its own Being from itself.  Because Dasein’s There derives from its
having-been-thrown in the past, it finds itself thrown into a particular set of
“factical” circumstances in the present.  Heidegger explains, “There is a Being
which belongs to everydayness; we call this the “<i>falling</i>” of Dasein. 
This term does not express any negative evaluation, but is used to signify that
Dasein is proximally and for the most part <i>alongside</i> the ‘world’ of its
concern.  This “absorption in...” has mostly the character of Being-lost in the
publicness of <i>das </i><i>Man</i>.  Dasein has, in the first instance, fallen
away from itself as an authentic potentiality for Being its Self and has fallen
into the ‘world.’”<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span

When Dasein falls into a factical situation, it tends to evaluate itself in the
terms dictated by that situation.  Rather than understanding the world as it
relates to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, Dasein becomes absorbed in
worldly entities and in the discourse of the anonymous public, das Man. 
According to Heidegger, fallen Dasein tends to lose itself in the demands of
the present, ignoring the legacy which it inherits from its past as well as its
projection into the future.  Heidegger therefore calls this mode of fallenness
“everydayness” because, in it, Dasein experiences existence as an eternal
present in which every day seems to be the same as every other.  Losing itself
in the everyday, Dasein tends to fall away from its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being and submerge itself in inauthenticity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Dasein’s
temporal experience of everydayness causes it to view its There in the light of
the world.  Heidegger explains “The phenomenon of falling does not give us
something like a ‘night view’ of Dasein ... Far from determining its nocturnal
side, it constitutes all Dasein’s days in their everydayness.”<a href="#_ftn35"

According to Heidegger, the eternally present day of everydayness causes Dasein
to fall into inauthenticity because it shines a consistent, unchanging light on
entities.  He explains that, due to the influence of tradition, everyday Dasein
discloses Being in a manner that covers it over.  He states, “...Everyone uses
it constantly and already understands what he means by [the concept Being.]  In
this way, that which the ancient philosophers found continually disturbing as
something obscure and hidden has taken on a clarity and self-evidence that if
anyone continues to talk about it he is charged with an error of method.”<a

further asserts, “When tradition becomes master, it does so in such a way that
what it ‘transmits’ is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part,
that it rather becomes concealed.   Tradition takes what has come down to us
and delivers it over to self-evidence.”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"

that authentic Dasein must confront its fundamental strangeness to understand it. 
In everydayness, however, the pallid illumination of self-evidence lights up
Being for everyone as if it were unremarkable and obvious.  Furthermore, by
criticizing the notion of “clarity,” Heidegger equates this superficial light
with the Cartesian emphasis on clear and distinct perception.  Rather than
actually enabling people to authentically understand Being, the light which
Cartesian philosophy sheds blinds individuals to the ontological meaning of
Being and of Dasein itself.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger
asserts that Dasein’s everyday involvement with das Man prevents it from
authentically viewing its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.  He explains that,
within the There of Dasein, it encounters other unique Daseins through the
visual modalities of considerateness and forbearance [<i>Rücksicht und
Nachsicht.</i>]  Dasein’s everydayness, however, tends to obscure this vision. 
“This Being-with-one-another dissolves one’s own Dasein completely into the
kind of Being of ‘the Others’ in such a way, indeed, that the Others, as distinguishable
and explicit, vanish more and more.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span

In its everydayness, Dasein treats other Daseins inconsiderately, failing to
respect their individuality.  Instead, Dasein views the world as constituted by
a homogeneous mass of people.  Rather than attending to its own possibilities,
Dasein becomes a spectator to life, <i>watching over</i> the ways in which it
differs from das Man.  By doing so, Dasein allows itself to become swallowed up
in this mob mentality.  When it loses itself in its identification with das
Man, Dasein lets das Man regulate the ways in which it can view its world.  
Heidegger explains that das Man makes Dasein see its possibilities in the
modality of averageness.  He states, “Das Man prescribes one’s state of mind
and determines what and how one ‘sees’”<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

According to Heidegger, Dasein’s involvement with das Man causes it to adopt
das Man’s standards for evaluating its world and its existence.  Das Man
dictates to Dasein the way in which it can view its world.  Inevitably, it
mandates a viewpoint which any anonymous person can take over, a perspective
which Dasein has not seized as its ownmost.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Heidegger
insists that this average way of seeing monitors Dasein in order to prevent it
from projecting any of its unique and exceptional possibilities “In this
averageness with which it prescribes what can and may be ventured, it <i>keeps

Das Man effectively obscures Dasein’s Being from itself by disclosing
possibilities ambiguously.  “When, in our everyday Being-with-one-another, we
encounter the sort of thing which is accessible to everyone, and about which
anyone can say anything, it soon becomes impossible to decide what is disclosed
in a genuine understanding and what is not”<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"

According to Heidegger, the public mode of disclosure covers over possibilities
with facades, making them appear as if they are well-understood phenomenon when
they are actually mere semblances.  “Everything looks as if it were genuinely
understood, genuinely taken hold of, genuinely spoken, though at bottom it is
not; or else it does not look so, and yet at bottom it is.”<a href="#_ftn44"

Therefore, das Man’s average seizure and interpretation of possibilities
prevents Dasein from viewing these possibilities clearly.  Not only does das
Man control the way in which phenomenon are disclosed, it also determines the
way in which Dasein approaches its world.  By losing itself in its
everydayness, Dasein learns to view the world inauthentically.  “Care becomes
concern with possibilities of seeing the ‘world’ merely as it <i>looks </i>...
Curiosity has become free, it concerns itself with seeing, not in order to
understand what is seen (that is, to come into a Being towards it) but <i>just </i>in
order to see.  It seeks novelty only in order to leap from it anew to another

According to Heidegger, just as everydayness hides authentic possibilities as
semblances, everyday Dasein dims down its power of sight so that it can not
view any possibilities authentically.  Rather than seizing and projecting its
possibilities as its ownmost, everyday Dasein develops the attitude of a
disengaged spectator who merely observes the world as it passes by. </p>

discussion of das Man’s distortion of Dasein’s visual possibilities doubles as
a discussion of das Man’s power over Dasein.  Heidegger asserts that, in its
everydayness, Dasein does not exist as its own Self, but rather as a
“they-Self” [<i>Man-selbst</i>] which is thoroughly mastered by das Man, “the
‘nobody’ to whom every Dasein has already surrendered itself in

As with his analysis of Thrownness, Heidegger describes Dasein’s relationship
to das Man using terms such as “surrender” and “submission.”  He asserts that
this mob mentality dominates Dasein’s very mode of existence by mandating a
publicly acceptable way for it to act.  By doing so, das Man snatches away
Dasein’s sovereign power to project its possibilities as its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being.  Heidegger explains that, when one Dasein interacts
with another, it can dominate the Other by leaping in for it.  “This kind of
solicitude takes over for the Other that with which he is to concern himself. 
The Other is thus thrown out of his own position; he steps back so that
afterwards, when the matter has been attended to, he can either take it over as
something finished and at his disposal, or disburden himself of it completely. 
In such solicitude the Other can become one who is dominated and dependent,
even if this domination is a tacit one and remains hidden from him.”<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            According

and Time</u> consistently demonstrates Heidegger’s suspicion of speech. 
Throughout this work, Heidegger subordinates linguistic expression to visual
understanding.  He defines communication as “letting someone see with us what
we have pointed out by giving it a definite character.  That which is shared is
our <i>Being towards</i> what has been pointed out. ... That which is put
forward can be passed along in ‘further retelling.’  There is a widening of the

For Heidegger, discourse functions as a means by which a unique optical
perspective can be rendered publicly accessible.  Through it, Dasein can share
its understanding of its Being with other Daseins.  Although Dasein, as an
entity who exists as Being-with-Others, must necessarily share its visions,
this sharing also opens up possibilities for distortion. Heidegger continues,
“However, what has been pointed out may become veiled again in further
retelling.”<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span

By allowing its understanding of its ownmost possibility-for-Being to be
influenced by Others, Dasein risks losing sight of its own choices.  By

According to him, its “blind and isolated categorical assertions” prevent
Dasein from disclosing its own possibilities to itself.    </p>

asserts that the public sphere most severely distorts Being by interpreting it
as a set of independent, self-subsistent entities.  Heidegger expands upon this
idea in his distinction between the categorical and the existential.  He
states, “Because Dasein’s character of Being are defined in terms of
existentiality, we call them “<i>existentialia </i>“ ... When used
ontologically, this term [<span style='font-family:Symbol'>kathgoreisqai</span>:

two modes of understanding Being.  He insists that, because Dasein’s
existential projection constitutes its Being, it can only be understood in

according to their distinct characteristics.  Categorical thought originates
from Dasein’s Being-with Others.  Heidegger explains that Dasein encounters
other Daseins through the work world which they have in common.  He asserts
that das Man effectively distracts Dasein’s vision from its ownmost
possibilities and focuses it upon the beings within the common work world.  As
mentioned before, Heidegger defines Dasein as the clearing which is itself the
source of light in its There.  However, Heidegger claims that “Dasein is
inclined to fall back upon its world (the world in which it is) and to
interpret itself in terms of that world by its reflected light.”<a

According to this statement, everyday Dasein veils its existential status by
allowing itself to be defined by the entities which it itself manifests.  It
does so by giving these entities the definite character of
present-at-handness.  Heidegger explains, “If knowing is to be possible as a
way of determining the nature of the present-at-hand by observing it, then
there must first be a <i>deficiency </i>in our having-to-do with the world
concernfully.  When concern holds back [<i>Sichenthalten</i>] from any kind of
producing, manipulating, and the like, it puts itself into ... the mode of just
tarrying alongside. ...  This kind of Being towards the world is one which lets
us encounter beings within-the-world purely in the <i>way they look </i>[<span
style='font-family:Symbol'>eidoV</span>], just that.”  By adopting the public
viewpoint that the world consists of subsistent, present-at-hand beings, Dasein
conceals its own concerned involvement in the world.  That is, Dasein obscures
the fact that the world of entities ultimately refers back to its own
projection of its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.  Whereas Heidegger states
that understanding Dasein always has a certain comportment [Verhalten] towards
Being, he argues that, just like Descartes affirms his power by withholding
judgment, “tarrying” Dasein holds itself back [Sichenthalten] from the world.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            According
to Heidegger, everyday Dasein refrains from properly seizing the world around
it as ready-to-hand by viewing the world as having an existence independent of
its own projection.  Although these entities, as present-at-hand, still refer
back to the grasp of Dasein, Dasein avoids employing them to promote its own
possibilities.  By viewing and grasping the world as merely present-at-hand,
Dasein misunderstands the temporal structure of its own existence.  As cited
above, Heidegger states that discourse “lets someone see with us what we have
pointed out by giving it a definite character”<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54"

He expands upon this notion of defining the character of entities in his
discussion of Descartes’ analysis of substance. “Such entities are those <i>which
always are what they are</i>.  Accordingly, that which can be shown to have the
character of something that <i>constantly remains</i> (as <i>remanens capax
mutationum</i>,) makes up the real Being of those entities of the world which
get experienced.  That which enduringly remains, really <i>is</i>.”<a

Everyday Dasein conceives of Being as constituted by a set of self-subsistent
objects whose Beings are independent from Dasein’s existence and are grounded
by distinct, eternal essences.  By analyzing Being as present-at-hand, Dasein
concludes that Being is something which has a permanent substance and which
manifests itself in a fixed manner during every present moment.    According to
Heidegger, this obscures the fact that Dasein’s Being exists as a dynamic <i>becoming</i>
in which it projects its possibilities into the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            In
the final chapter of <u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger seems to claim that the
misinterpretation of time lies at the root of all misunderstanding of Being. 
He asserts that “temporality is estatico-horizonally constitutive for the
clearedness of the There,”<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span

that time, as the horizon of meaning of Being and of Dasein, constitutes the
light in which Dasein discloses itself.  However, he claims everyday Dasein
interprets time as some familiar ready-to-hand or present-at-hand thing. 
Heidegger invents a mythic narrative to explain how Dasein’s knowledge of this
internal temporal light-source has been obscured.  He states, “Everyday circum<i>spective</i>
Being-in-the-world needs the <i>possibility of sight</i> (and this means that
it needs brightness) if it is to deal concernfully with what is ready-to-hand
within the present-to-hand. ... In its thrownness Dasein has surrendered to the
changes of day and night. ... The ‘then’ with which Dasein concerns itself gets
dated in terms of something which is connected with getting bright, and which
is connected with it in the closest kind of environmental involvement — namely,
the rising of the sun.”<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[57]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
Because Dasein’s Being, its existential self-projection, depends upon its
vision of possibilities, it relies upon the light which illuminates these
possibilities.  Although Heidegger argues that this light ultimately emanates
from Dasein’s status as a <i>Lichtung</i>, it receives this disclosedness in
its thrownness.  It therefore does not experience this light in its
self-assertion, but rather as something to which it has surrendered itself. 
Submitting itself to the world, concerned Dasein tends to interpret itself in
terms of the world, and tends to interpret its own temporal illumination as dependent
upon the ready-to-hand sun.  For Heidegger, this misinterpretation of the sun
serves as the paradigmatic example of Dasein’s interpreting itself in the
reflected light of the world.  Furthermore, by viewing the sun as a substitute
for the temporal clearedness which discloses existential possibilities, he
opposes an entire philosophical tradition which, starting with Plato,
interpreted the sun as the source of theoretical intelligibility.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            According
to Heidegger, das Man veils the essence of temporality even further by
converting it into something which is present-at-hand.  With the ready-to-hand
interpretation of temporality, Dasein interprets the sun as it refers to its
own possibilities.  For example, farmer Dasein interprets daybreak as the time
to feed his livestock and Mexican Dasein interprets high noon as the time to
take a siesta.  The public realm, however, veils the personal relevance of this
temporal light.  Heidegger states, “The dating of things in terms of the
heavenly body which sheds forth light and warmth, and in terms of its
distinctive ‘places’ in the sky, is a way of assigning time which can be done
for ‘Everyman’ at any time in the same way.”<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58"

The public interpretation of temporality distances Dasein even further from
Dasein’s Being.  By making time a generalized commodity, das Man posits it as
an external thing which Dasein can observe from the outside rather than
something upon which Dasein projects its very existence.  Anticipating his
essays on technology, Heidegger finally warns, “For the ‘advanced’ Dasein the
day and the presence of sunlight no longer have such a special function as they
have for the ‘primitive’ Dasein on which our analysis of ‘natural’
time-reckoning has been based; for the ‘advanced’ Dasein has the ‘advantage’ of
even being able to turn night into day.”<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59"

Heidegger suggests that, through a perverse technological alchemy, the public
realm of modernity has distorted the authentic interpretation of temporal
clearedness through its invention of time pieces which do not depend on
sunlight, and also, it seems, through its invention of mechanical lighting
systems.  The modern interpretation of time has completely veiled the temporal
self-illumination of Dasein by disclosing time as merely a series of measurable
and datable moments which subsist independently of Dasein’s Being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            To
overcome the distortions of das Man, Heidegger insists that Dasein must engage
in a violent struggle for the truth of its Being.  For example, describing his
methodology, Heidegger states, “The way in which Being and its structures are
encountered in the mode of phenomenon is one which must first of all be <i>wrested</i>
from the objects of phenomenology.”<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span

Not only does Heidegger correlate the quest for truth with a grasp, this grasp
requires a violent exertion of Dasein’s power.  Because das Man has totally
concealed phenomena as being merely present-at-hand, authentic Dasein must
fight against das Man’s interpretations and discover the meaning of its own
possibilities.  Heidegger asserts that Dasein must grasp truth violently to
clarify its vision from the viewpoint mandated by das Man.  “Common sense
concerns itself, whether ‘theoretically’ or ‘practically’ only with beings
which can be surveyed at a glance circumspectively  What is distinctive in
common sense is that it has in view only the experiencing of ‘factual’ beings,
in order that it may be able to rid itself of an understanding of Being.  It
fails to recognize that beings can be experienced ‘factually’ only when Being
is already understood, even if it has not been conceptualized.  Common sense
misunderstands understanding.  And <i>therefore</i> common sense must
necessarily pass off as ‘violent’ anything that lies beyond the reach of its
understanding, or any attempt to go out so far.”<a href="#_ftn61"

Das Man views beings superficially as entities which have an actual identity
rather than as possibilities which exist for-the-sake-of Dasein’s ownmost
potentiality-for-Being.  Heidegger asserts that das Man resents Dasein’s effort
to seize existence as its own and interprets this as violence.  He explains
that das Man attempts to lull Dasein into a tranquil acceptance of the status
quo in order to cover up the anxiety which Dasein feels for its existence. 
Furthermore, this public realm levels off all genuine possibilities by
asserting that any unique and authentic projection could have been accomplished
by anyone.  Therefore, Dasein must break violently with the complacent
averageness which das Man inculcates, bravely asserting its own authenticity. 
Heidegger states, “Existential Interpretation will never seek to take over any
authoritarian pronouncement as to those things which, from an existentiell
point of view, are possible or binding. ... <i>Does not the violence of this
projection amount to freeing Dasein’s undisguised phenomenal content</i>,”<a

this statement, Heidegger seems to distinguish two forms of violence.  His
reference to “authoritarian pronouncements” seems to be a covert critique of
das Man’s mode of interpretation.  That is, das Man dominates Dasein’s
understanding of phenomena through the public discourse it authors and through
the definitions which it pronounces.  It makes its interpretations binding by
fixing the identity of entities as things which are distinct and permanent. 
Heidegger contrasts this repressive violence with the violence which liberates
possibilities for Dasein’s projection of its potentiality-for-Being.  Heidegger
speaks of this self-realization as “the possibility that Dasein may choose its
own hero.”<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span

This statement conjures the image of authentic Dasein as the masculine
protagonist in a Greek tragedy who struggles courageously against the brutality
of the elements and the cowardice of other men.  For Heidegger, authentic
Dasein is the one which seizes entities as possibilities rather than as things
and which defeats the hegemony of das Man.  It is the one which struggles
against the obfuscations of the world and of the public in order to be true to
its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            According
to Heidegger, Dasein establishes its authenticity by properly caring for its
own Being.  As mentioned before, Dasein does so by becoming transparent to
itself.  “The sight which is related primarily and on the whole to existence we
call “<i>transparency.</i>” ... [This is a matter] of seizing upon the full
disclosedness of Being-in-the-world <i>throughout all</i> the constitutive
items which are essential to it, and doing so with understanding.”<a

this state of transparency, Dasein’s status as the one who sees and as the one
who is lighted coincide.  Dasein understands itself by understanding the
totality of all the existentials which articulate its existence.  Transparent
Dasein must visually understand that it exists as the illuminated There where
its Being visually projects itself towards its ownmost-potentiality-for-Being. 
It must understand that it has been thrown into a world of beings and has
fallen into an everyday set of factical circumstances, but that it can
authentically seize upon the possibilities manifested in its thrown, fallen world. 
According to Heidegger, Dasein must therefore understand that, ultimately, it
exists as the freedom to project authentic possibilities and to will its
ownmost potentiality-for-Being.  Dasein becomes transparent to itself by
authentically confronting the possibility of its death.  Heidegger states,
“[Anticipatory resoluteness is] the understanding which follows the call of
conscience and which frees for death the possibility of acquiring <i>power</i>
over Dasein’s <i>existence </i>and of basically dispersing all fugitive
Self-concealments.”<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span

Heidegger asserts that the possibility of death is <i>the</i> possibility of
Dasein’s Being which belongs exclusively to it, which relates to nothing
outside of it, and which can not be taken away from it.  Heidegger explains,
“This possibility of representing breaks down completely if the issue is one of
representing that possibility-of-Being which makes up Dasein’s coming to an
end, and which, gives to its wholeness.”<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66"

This statement describes death as the paradigmatic example of that which can
not be represented.  Heidegger distrusts representation because it detaches
Dasein from its world, positing Dasein as a subject and the world as a set of
objects, a notion embraced by Cartesian epistemology.  Furthermore,
representation conceals Dasein’s involvement in its possibilities by allowing
other Daseins to view a possibility which only Dasein itself should be able to
see.  Heidegger continues, “<i>No one can take the Other’s dying away from him</i>
... By its very essence, death is in every case mine, in so far as it ‘is’ at
all.”<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span

his terminology of vision with that of the grasp, Heidegger asserts that das
Man’s incapacity to represent death correlates with it’s inability to leap in
for Dasein to <i>take away</i>  this possibility from Dasein.  Because no one
can die someone else’s death, Heidegger insists that this mortality absolutely
individualizes each Dasein.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Although
death may strike Dasein at any moment, everyday Dasein attempts to cover over
this possibility by fleeing from its inevitability.  Heidegger explains that,
in this flight, Dasein falls into the public world of the present which is
dominated by das Man.  Through its interpretation of death, das Man makes
Dasein tranquil about the anxiety it feels for its death and denies Dasein the
heroic courage it requires to face up to this anxiety.  Das Man attempts to
represent death theoretically as an objective and familiar event which is
possible for everyone and therefore for no one in particular.  The public realm
views death from the perspective of the everyday present as something which
will occur at some datable point in the future.  Heidegger opposes this view by
saying, “Das Man covers up what is most peculiar in death’s certainty — <i>that
it is possible at any moment</i>”<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span

In this statement, Heidegger seems to locate the origin of everydayness in das
Man’s covering of death.  Heidegger explains that this possibility of death is
already disclosed each time Dasein discloses itself within its There.  Therefore,
Dasein can authentically relate to death only by becoming aware of the constant
anxiety that it feels for its mortality.  Heidegger continues, “Everyday
concern makes definite for itself the indefiniteness of certain death by
interposing before it those urgencies and possibilities which can be taken in
at a glance, and which belong to the everyday matters which are closest to us.”<a

the domination of das Man and become transparent to itself.  He contends that
the possibility of death differs from and grounds other possibilities.  He
states, “The more unveiledly this possibility gets understood, the more purely
does the understanding penetrate into it <i>as the possibility of the
impossibility of any existence at all.</i> ... It is the possibility of the
impossibility of every way of comporting oneself towards anything, of every way
of existing. ... In accordance with its essence, this possibility offers no
support for becoming intent on something, picturing to oneself the actuality
which is possible, and so forgetting its possibility.  Being-towards-death, as
anticipation of possibility, is what first <i>makes</i> this possibility <i>possible</i>,
and sets it free as possibility”<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span

Death, for Heidegger, is the possibility that Dasein’s projection of its
ownmost possibilities will be rendered impossible.  However, this possibility
of impossibility makes it possible for Dasein to project its possibilities.  
By accepting this as its ownmost possibility, Dasein clarifies how it exists
towards and through its possibilities.  Because Dasein can experience the
possibility of death, but can never experience the actuality of its own death,
death effectively makes the notion of possibility independent from the notion
of actuality.  The notion of actuality functions as the terminus of
potentiality which fulfills a possibility, but which also destroys the power of
this possibility by fulfilling it.  Heidegger demonstrates that, with death,
possibility already contains its own finitude within itself.  By arguing that
the Being of possibilities does not depend on what actual, present-at-hand
result they achieve, Heidegger preserves the independent power of
possibilities.  Heidegger explains that, by accepting its Being-towards the
finitude of its possibilities, Dasein can authentically understand that its
existence is oriented towards their terminus, the futurity towards which it
projects its possibilities.  Heidegger employs this notion that a possibility
contains its own termination to critique everydayness.  For Heidegger,
everydayness represents a comportment in which one avoids committing oneself to
either the birth or the finitude of authentic possibility.  Heidegger states
that “Everydayness is that Being which is ‘between’ birth and death.”<a

confrontation with death wrenches it away from the everyday domination of das
Man and from its everyday absorption in the world of beings.  </p>

explains that Dasein becomes transparent to itself by listening to the call of
its conscience.  In this call, the Dasein who has become anxious about its
imminent futural death appeals to itself as the one who has fallen in the
present among das Man.  Heidegger asserts that Dasein tends to flee into the tranquillity
of the environment provided by das Man in order to conceal the precariousness
of its existence.  This call reorients Dasein’s vision.  Heidegger states that
Dasein must <i>look away</i> from its everyday experiences with entities and
with others in order to confront the uncanniness of the nothingness which
threatens its existence with its finitude.  Heidegger explains how this anxious
confrontation differs from everyday encounters with entities.  “[Anxiety] does
not have any need for darkness, in which it is commonly easier for one to feel
uncanny.  In the dark there is emphatically ‘nothing to see,’ though the world
itself is <i>still</i> ‘there,’ and ‘there’ <i>more obtrusively</i>.”<a

Even though anxiety does not require any factical darkness, Heidegger seems to
suggest that the sight of existential darkness, like the vision of the
Dionysian abyss, discloses the true Being of Dasein’s There.  Not only does
this vision of darkness eradicate the pacifying light with which das Man
reveals the everyday existence of entities, it indicates that Dasein’s status
as the illuminated There of Being doubles as its status as the darkened There

as Heidegger describes anxious Dasein as submerged in darkness, he also
describes Dasein as submissive to the anxious voice of its own conscience. 
Because this domination comes from itself, it liberates Dasein from the

dominate, it discloses the nothingness which is “so close that it is

well as being beyond Dasein’s vision, the nothingness which conscience
discloses lies beyond its power.  Heidegger states, “The Self which as such has
to lay the basis for itself, can <i>never</i> get that basis into its power;
and yet, as existing, it must take over Being-a-basis.  In being a basis — that
is, in existing as thrown — Dasein constantly lags behind its possibilities. 
It is never existent <i>before</i> its basis, but only <i>from it </i>and<i> as
this basis</i>.  Thus “Being-a-basis” means never to have power over one’s
ownmost Being from the ground up.  This “not” belongs to the existential
meaning of “thrownness.”  It itself, being a basis, <i>is </i>a nullity of

Heidegger explains that, because Dasein has been thrown into its There, it
exists on the basis of a nullity.  That is, it has been thrown into a factical
situation which it has not chosen.  Heidegger asserts that Dasein’s power to
project its existence therefore depends upon it being unable to control the
circumstances upon which it projects.  Whereas everyday Dasein, influenced by
das Man, pretends that it can encompass everything within its power and its
vision, this abyss of nothingness discloses that which lies outside of its
possibilities.  Whereas das Man asserts that it has already mastered all possibilities,
this nullity discloses to Dasein that it can not seize all possibilities as its
own; that, in grasping one possibility, it must forsake all of the others.  
Accepting this nullity enables Dasein to become free for authentically choosing

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            By
resolutely disclosing the nullity which makes it anxious for its
potentiality-for-Being, Dasein acquires the vision and power to project itself
authentically.  Heidegger explains, “If Dasein, by anticipation, lets death
become powerful in itself, then, as free for death, Dasein understands itself
in its own <i>superior power</i>, the power of its finite freedom, so that in
this freedom, which ‘is’ only in its having chosen to make such a choice, it
can take over the <i>powerlessness</i> of abandonment to its having done so,
and can thus come to have a clear vision for the accidents of the Situation
that has been disclosed.”<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span

In its resoluteness, Dasein becomes so transparent to itself that it
understands the mortality which dominates its existence and the nullity which
grounds it.  It understands that it has been thrown into a world and therefore
submitted to it.  It sees that it has fallen into a world dominated by das Man
and therefore become lost in it.  Rather than attempting to eradicate the
inevitable facts of its submission, Dasein appropriates its submission
authentically and thereby becomes its own master.  By dominating itself,
authentic Dasein prevents either the world of entities or of das Man from fully
controlling it.  Even though Dasein is surrendered to a set of factical
circumstances which are beyond its power, it can still assert its sovereignty
by discovering the possibilities within its world which promote the
self-assertion of its ownmost-potentiality-for-Being.  Authentic Dasein
acquires a visual capacity to perceive such possibilities.  Heidegger explains,
“When resolute, Dasein has brought itself from falling, and has done so
precisely in order to be more authentically ‘there’ in the ‘moment of vision’
as regards the Situation which has been disclosed.”<a href="#_ftn76"
name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

Heidegger describes the moment of vision as the authentic mode of experiencing
the ecstasis of the present.  He utilizes it to critique the inauthentic vision
of the present, curiosity, which causes Dasein to fall into the everyday world
of das Man.  According to Heidegger, curious Dasein looks at appearances in
order to make them present, thereby forgetting its heritage and awaiting future
novelties.  Rather than being absorbed by well-lighted, present-at-hand
entities, Dasein, in its moment of vision, becomes fascinated by the obscurity
of its null basis, enabling it to encounter its ownmost possibilities and
opening it up to authentic temporality.  Heidegger states, “<i>Only an entity
which, in its Being, is essentially </i><b>futural</b><i> .. which, as futural,
is equiprimordially in the process of </i><b>having-been</b><i>, can, by
handing down to itself the possibility it has inherited, take over its
thrownness and be </i><b>in the moment of vision</b><i> for its time</i>.”<a

position:relative;top:0pt'>[77]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a> 
Dasein discloses its present authentically in a moment of vision in which it
understands both the heritage and the futural possibilities which lie within
the factical situation of its present.  In the moment of vision, therefore,
Dasein can take over its thrown There authentically by choosing and acting upon
the possibilities which it seizes as its ownmost.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Throughout
<u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger associates Dasein’s thrownness from the past
with its submission.  Dasein masters this submission authentically by understanding
its ownmost possibilities as those which have been handed down to it
historically.  Heidegger explains that, because everyday Dasein tends to
disperse itself into the many entities with which it concerns itself, it must
create a unity to bring itself together and to embrace the totality of its
existence.  Dasein understands this unity in a moment-of-vision during which it
willingly submits itself to its heritage by seizing upon a possibility which it
has inherited from the past.  He states, “Resoluteness constitutes the <i>loyalty</i>
of existence to its own Self ... this loyalty is a possible way of revering the
sole authority which a free existing can have - of revering the repeatable
possibilities of existence.”<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[78]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>  
By describing historical possibility as an authority, Heidegger indicates that
the mandates of history dominate Dasein, but do so in a way which fundamentally
differs from the domination exercised by das Man.  Heidegger speaks of Dasein’s
submission to history as an act of heroism, as a self-submission, and by
extension, a self-mastery.  Furthermore, Heidegger insists that Dasein’s
existential character as a Being-with-Others requires it to involve other
Daseins in its historizing.  Dasein can do so by leaping ahead of Others in
order to disclose possibilities which will help them become transparent to
themselves.  Rather than instituting an impersonal regime in which das Man
reigns, authentic Daseins can then work together on a common project while
still preserving their authentic individuality.  Heidegger states, “But if
fateful Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, exists essentially in Being-with-Others,
its historizing is a&nbsp;co-historizing and is determinative for it as <i>destiny</i>. 
This is how we designate the historizing of a community, of a people [Volk.] 
Our fates have already been guided in advance, in our Being with one another in
the same world and in our resoluteness for definite possibilities.  Only in
communicating and in struggling does the power of destiny become free.”<a

Ominously, Heidegger extends his description of Dasein’s heroism to an entire
group of people, of a Volk, describing their effort to understand themselves as
a struggle [<i>Kampf</i>,] potentially a violent one.</p>

style='font-family:Times'>  Heidegger, even in his student days, has always
displayed an affinity for Nietzsche.  I would argue that many ideas in <u>Being
and Time</u>, including the correlation between light and power, are developed
from Heidegger’s meditations on Nietzsche.  Heidegger himself seems to affirm
this comparison by recasting many of his own concepts in Nietzsche’s vocabulary
in his Nietzsche lectures, especially the first two.  However, the relationship
between Nietzsche and Heidegger is quite complex and therefore would require an
extremely nuanced discussion, one which lies outside the scope of this thesis. 
David Farrell Krell has done a lot of good work in this area.  See his <u>Daimon
Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy</u>   [Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana
University Press, 1992.] and his <u>Intimations of Mortality</u> [University
Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1986.]  Also see Jacques
