<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>             This
study investigates the creation and destruction of a self-assertive modern
subjectivity through close readings of metaphors of vision and power in
Descartes, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Levinas.  René Descartes inaugurates
modern thought by effecting a <i>reductio ad hominem</i>, figuring the ego
rather than God as the absolute spectator of reality and judge of truth. 
Throughout his work, he attempts to overcome the possibility of doubt in order
to secure control over the contingencies of his cognitive world.  Descartes
does so by creating a spectatorial position for a detached subject, separating
it from the external world.  Safely stationed within a point of indubitable self-reflexivity,
the Cartesian ego masters his world by positing it as a set of objects and
referring these objects back to his own absolute perspective. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Friedrich
Nietzsche argues against the spectatorial tradition for establishing a
frightened subjectivity who retreats back from the abyss of nothingness into
the complacent security of consciousness.  Against this, Nietzsche affirms
visual modalities through which the self heroically asserts himself.  In <u>Birth
of Tragedy</u>, Nietzsche endorses the engaged, poetic vision of the artist
inspired by the gods Dionysus and Apollo.  By drawing upon the powers granted
by these two deities, the artist can confront bravely the nihility underlying
the visible world while producing rapturous, life-affirming illusions.  In his
later work, Nietzsche continues his critique of spectatorial subjectivity
through his analysis of perspectivism.  Arguing that the viewer’s will to power
creates and therefore conditions his viewpoints, Nietzsche denies the existence
of any absolute, detached perspective.  Instead, he argues that one should
assert one’s will to power, thereby creating stronger, more healthy
perspectives.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Influenced
by Nietzsche’s perspectivism, Martin Heidegger’s <u>Being and Time</u>
consistently correlates vision and self-assertion.  Heidegger explains that
Dasein exists as the lighted space for Being’s unconcealment, disclosing Being
according to the way it visually understands itself.  Dasein does not produce
this understanding by contemplating existence, but rather by seizing its
possibilities and projecting its potentiality-for-Being.  Like Nietzsche,
Heidegger argues that, to consummate its vision and power, Dasein must confront
an abyss of nothingness; it must understand how its vision and power are
radically limited by death.  By positioning Dasein as a spectator over its
existence, however, the public sphere of das Man distracts Dasein from its
dread of mortality, preventing it from determining any of its own
possibilities.  Therefore, the authentic Dasein which projects its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being must break away from this mass consciousness and find
its supreme vision and power in the very conditions that limit them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Based
upon a lecture course given in 1935, <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>
attempts to establish Heidegger as the proper spiritual-philosophical leader of
National Socialism.  This text rewrites the correlation which Heidegger draws
between power and the light of truth by inscribing militarism into its language
and by enlisting its ideas in the service of Germany’s political situation. 
Dasein’s self-assertive projection of possibilities transforms into man’s
violent exertion of power; Dasein’s transparent vision transforms into man’s
violent struggle with appearances.  Furthermore, Heidegger applies his
ontological analysis to Germany’s national Dasein.  Heidegger warns the German
nation that the “darkening of the spirit,” the scientific attitude which
observes and orders life, threatens to destroy its spiritual culture.  To break
it out of its complacent, familiar security, Heidegger challenges the German
Dasein to take violent risks in order to realize the “inner truth and
greatness” of National Socialism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Emmanuel
Levinas’ early work charts his increasing alienation from his former teacher Heidegger
as well as his rethinking of visual metaphors.  In his 1934 essay, “Reflections
on the Philosophy of Hitlerism,” he opposes the German — and implicitly the
Heideggerian — strategy of deriving power from the elementary forces which
render one powerless, particularly the forces of history and of materiality. 
In this essay, he praises Enlightenment thought for positing subjectivity as a
spectatorial relationship because the medium of light releases man from his
inevitable connection with the material world.  After World War Two, Levinas
directs his philosophical efforts towards an escape from the oppressive
incumbency of Heideggerian thought.  Just as “Reflections on the Philosophy of
Hitlerism” attempts to sever the bond between the self and the elementary
forces which ground and imprison it, Levinas’ <u>Time and the Other</u>
attempts to break the inevitable link which Heidegger establishes between a
general existence and particular existents.  In his essay “Is Ontology
Fundamental?,” Levinas argues that Heidegger articulates this primordial
connection as the lighting of Being’s unconcealment through Dasein.  By
questioning the primacy of vision and light, Levinas uproots ontology, opening

to the metaphysical relationship with the discursive Other.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:24.0pt'>            Working
from Husserl’s observation that consciousness can be broken up into a series of
discrete events, Levinas describes the genealogy of the spectatorial moment in <u>Totality
and Infinity</u>.  He demonstrates how the intercourse between the Other and
myself gives birth to me as an embodied I who, like Gyges, can look out at the
world without being seen.  Secure in my home, I can assert my absolute dominion
over the sensible world by subsuming it within my consciousness.  However, when
I look at the visage of Other, I see defenseless eyes which look back at me.  I
find myself unable to absorb the alterity of the Other whose gaze questions my
sovereign self-assertion. </p>
