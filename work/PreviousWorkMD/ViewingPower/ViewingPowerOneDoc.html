<p  >Even
though the female thinker Diotima gave birth to the philosophical eros, most of
Western philosophy constitutes a male body of thought. That is, men have
written the majority of what we consider to be the traditional philosophical
canon using phallocentric metaphors. Therefore, I will not attempt to mask
this inherent sexism by following the common practice of alternating genders or
using "he or she" to refer to the self. Because the modern philosophy has
typically constructed the subject as male, I will describe it as a he. </p>


<p  >Conversely,
Heidegger deliberately avoids using gendered pronouns when discussing Dasein.
Because "Dasein" names the historical space for Being's unconcealment rather
than a human entity, I will refer to Dasein as 'it.' </p>


<p>Levinas
founds his opposition to totalizing philosophy upon the bedrock of gendered
distinctions. He states, "The difference between the sexes is a formal
structure, but one that carves up reality in another sense and conditions the
very possibility of reality as multiple, against the unity of being proclaimed
by Parmenides."<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>
Therefore, I will attempt to describe the Other using masculine or feminine
pronouns to show when Levinas refers to masculine or feminine aspect of the
Other's alterity. </p>


<p  >I
will have to change voices dramatically when discussing the being that relates
to this Other. In <u>Time and the Other</u>, Levinas tries to think through
the relationships between existing and existents. He explains, "One can not
ignore this distinction -- which I have already used -- between <i>Sein </i>�and <i>Seiendes</i>,
Being and beings, but which for reasons of euphony I prefer to render as <i>existing</i>
and <i>existent</i>."<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[2]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a><i></i>I
would argue that, within <u>Time and the Other</u>, Levinas's voice stays within
Heidegger's ontological register. Therefore, even though Levinas calls the
existent's production of itself a "virile," implicitly masculine, event, I will
refer to this 'existent' or 'self' or 'ego' as an 'it.' Starting with his
article "Is Ontology Fundamental,"<i> </i>Levinas begins to develop a
metaphysical voice which will accurately convey the relationship with the
transcendent Other. He explains in <u>Totality and Infinity,</u> "The face to
face is established starting with a point separated from exteriority so
radically that it maintains itself of itself, is me."<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>
That is, that the personal relationship with the Other does not involve any
anonymous subject, but rather starts from <i>me</i>. Therefore, I will discuss
"Is Ontology Fundamental?" and <u>Totality and Infinity</u> in the first
person, using the third person only when an aspect of me such as the will, the
part of me that exerts itself in the impersonal public world.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p  > This
study investigates the creation and destruction of a self-assertive modern
subjectivity through close readings of metaphors of vision and power in
Descartes, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Levinas. Rene Descartes inaugurates
modern thought by effecting a <i>reductio ad hominem</i>, figuring the ego
rather than God as the absolute spectator of "reality and judge of truth."
Throughout his work, he attempts to overcome the possibility of doubt in order
to secure control over the contingencies of his cognitive world. Descartes
does so by creating a spectatorial position for a detached subject, separating
it from the external world. Safely stationed within a point of indubitable self-reflexivity,
the Cartesian ego masters his world by positing it as a set of objects and
referring these objects back to his own absolute perspective. </p>


<p  > Friedrich
Nietzsche argues against the spectatorial tradition for establishing a
frightened subjectivity who retreats back from the abyss of nothingness into
the complacent security of consciousness.� Against this, Nietzsche affirms
visual modalities through which the self heroically asserts himself.� In <u>Birth
of Tragedy</u>, Nietzsche endorses the engaged, poetic vision of the artist
inspired by the gods Dionysus and Apollo.� By drawing upon the powers granted
by these two deities, the artist can confront bravely the nihility underlying
the visible world while producing rapturous, life-affirming illusions.� In his
later work, Nietzsche continues his critique of spectatorial subjectivity
through his analysis of perspectivism.� Arguing that the viewer�s will to power
creates and therefore conditions his viewpoints, Nietzsche denies the existence
of any absolute, detached perspective.� Instead, he argues that one should
assert one�s will to power, thereby creating stronger, more healthy
perspectives.� </p>


<p  > Influenced
by Nietzsche�s perspectivism, Martin Heidegger�s <u>Being and Time</u>
consistently correlates vision and self-assertion.� Heidegger explains that
Dasein exists as the lighted space for Being�s unconcealment, disclosing Being
according to the way it visually understands itself.� Dasein does not produce
this understanding by contemplating existence, but rather by seizing its
possibilities and projecting its potentiality-for-Being.� Like Nietzsche,
Heidegger argues that, to consummate its vision and power, Dasein must confront
an abyss of nothingness; it must understand how its vision and power are
radically limited by death.� By positioning Dasein as a spectator over its
existence, however, the public sphere of das Man distracts Dasein from its
dread of mortality, preventing it from determining any of its own
possibilities. Therefore, the authentic Dasein which projects its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being must break away from this mass consciousness and find
its supreme vision and power in the very conditions that limit them. </p>


<p  > Based
upon a lecture course given in 1935, <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>
attempts to establish Heidegger as the proper spiritual-philosophical leader of
National Socialism. This text rewrites the correlation which Heidegger draws
between power and the light of truth by inscribing militarism into its language
and by enlisting its ideas in the service of Germany's political situation.
Dasein's self-assertive projection of possibilities transforms into man's
violent exertion of power; Dasein's transparent vision transforms into man's
violent struggle with appearances. Furthermore, Heidegger applies his
ontological analysis to Germany's national Dasein. Heidegger warns the German
nation that the "darkening of the spirit," the scientific attitude which
observes and orders life, threatens to destroy its spiritual culture.� To break
it out of its complacent, familiar security, Heidegger challenges the German
Dasein to take violent risks in order to realize the "inner truth and
greatness" of National Socialism.</p>


<p  > Emmanuel
Levinas's early work charts his increasing alienation from his former teacher Heidegger
as well as his rethinking of visual metaphors. In his 1934 essay, "Reflections
on the Philosophy of Hitlerism," he opposes the German -- and implicitly the
Heideggerian -- strategy of deriving power from the elementary forces which
render one powerless, particularly the forces of history and of materiality.
In this essay, he praises Enlightenment thought for positing subjectivity as a
spectatorial relationship because the medium of light releases man from his
inevitable connection with the material world. After World War Two, Levinas
directs his philosophical efforts towards an escape from the oppressive
incumbency of Heideggerian thought. Just as "Reflections on the Philosophy of
Hitlerism" attempts to sever the bond between the self and the elementary
forces which ground and imprison it, Levinas's <u>Time and the Other</u>
attempts to break the inevitable link which Heidegger establishes between a
general existence and particular existents. In his essay "Is Ontology
Fundamental?," Levinas argues that Heidegger articulates this primordial
connection as the lighting of Being's unconcealment through Dasein. By
questioning the primacy of vision and light, Levinas uproots ontology, opening
me<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>up
to the metaphysical relationship with the discursive Other. </p>


<p  > Working
from Husserl's observation that consciousness can be broken up into a series of
discrete events, Levinas describes the genealogy of the spectatorial moment in <u>Totality
and Infinity</u>. He demonstrates how the intercourse between the Other and
myself gives birth to me as an embodied I who, like Gyges, can look out at the
world without being seen.  "Secure in my home, I can assert my absolute dominion
over the sensible world by subsuming it within my consciousness." However, when
I look at the visage of Other, I see defenseless eyes which look back at me. I
find myself unable to absorb the alterity of the Other whose gaze questions my
sovereign self-assertion. </p>

<h1>1. Descartes and
Nietzsche</h1>


<p  > </p>


<p  > Descartes
inaugurates modern thought by approaching all philosophical questions from the
perspective of a spectator.� Descartes declares �whatever I perceive clearly
and distinctly is true.�<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Whereas most previous thought grounded truth in a transcendental source,
typically God, Platonic forms and/or Aristotelian universals, Descartes�
assertion effects a <i>reductio ad hominem</i> by locating the foundation of
truth in the cognition of the human mind.� Descartes explains the two
conditions which assure truth, clarity and distinctness, saying, �I call a
perception clear when it is present and accessible to the attentive mind � just
as we see something clearly when it is present to the eye�s gaze and stimulates
it with a sufficient degree of strength and accessibility.� I call a perception
�distinct� if, as well as being clear, it is so sharply separated from all
other perceptions that it contains within it only what is clear.�<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[2]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Descartes comparison of cognition with the �eye�s gaze,� as well as his
frequent invocations of the �mental eye� and the �natural light,� demonstrate
that he models philosophical thinking upon a visual paradigm.� Furthermore, he
figures this cognition as establishing a spectatorial relationship between an
observing subject and the objects which it presents to itself for inspection.</p>


<p  > By
effecting a radical separation between the thinking subject and the
contemplated object, Descartes opens up a space for uncertainty.� Because the
subject, isolated in his mental space, has no natural connection with the
objects he sees, he has no assurance that they actually exist.�� Furthermore,
Descartes� usage of a visual cognitive model exposes his clear and distinct
perception to the possibility of profound visual distortion.� Descartes
confronts the insecurity of his knowledge by treating it as an epistemological
problem presented to a philosophical spectator.� Descartes asserts, �the
conduct of our life depends entirely of our senses, and since sight is the
noblest and most comprehensive of the senses, inventions which serve to
increase its power are undoubtedly the most useful there can be.�<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Although Descartes makes this statement in reference to implements such as
telescopes, it can also be applied to his entire philosophical project.�
Throughout his work, Descartes attempts to establish a secure, rational
foundation for existence by locating an indubitable power of sight.� In order
to repress the threats to his clear and distinct perception, Descartes
establishes an absolute position from which the philosophical spectator can
view the world. </p>


<p  > Descartes
observes that most of the ideas which he considers to be true have been
acquired from or through the senses.� In order to secure an absolute foundation
for truth, Descartes must probe the reliability of his senses.� However,
Descartes notes, �from time to time, I have found that the senses deceive, and
it is prudent never to trust completely those who have deceived us even once.�<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[4]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Descartes� initial skepticism arises from an epistemological crisis which
occurs once he observes the ambiguity of his senses, especially his visual
faculty.� He realizes that his reliance upon the clarity of these senses also
makes him prey to forces which could deceive him.� After considering various
factors which could possibly distort his perception, Descartes laments that he
may forget about the insecurity of a sensory foundation.� Like a prisoner who
imagines an illusory freedom, he fears that he might �happily slide back into
my old opinions and dread being shaken out of them, for fear that my peaceful
sleep may be followed by hard labor when I wake, and that I shall have to toil
not in the light, but amid the inextricable darkness of the problems I have now
raised.�<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[5]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
By comparing his epistemological problems to a prisoner�s imagination of an
illusion and by invoking light and darkness, Descartes inscribes the dilemma of
all of the senses in a visual framework.� Furthermore, in this statement,
Descartes condemns his ignorant reliance upon sensual data, yet acknowledges
that this complacency arises from the very real dread of darkness, from the
insecurity caused by the abyss of uncertainty.� A realization of human
impotence develops from this insecurity.� Descartes explains, �since deception
and error seem to be imperfections, the less powerful they make my original
cause, the more likely it is that I am so imperfect as to be deceived all the
time.�<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[6]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
For Descartes, the possibility of illusory sensory knowledge indicates the
possible imperfection and weakness of human nature.� Similarly, Descartes
realizes that the reliability of his senses depends upon whether a �malicious
demon of the <i>utmost power</i>�<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[7]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�deceives
him.</p>


<p  > Whereas
the machinations of a malicious demon would render Descartes� sensory
perception useless, he realizes that he possesses another power which a demon
could not damage.� He states �Even if it is not in my power to know any truth,
I shall at least do what is in my power, that is, resolutely guard against
assenting to any falsehoods.�� Therefore, Descartes� first power is a negative,
defensive power:� he does not have a power to assert something, but rather a
power to withhold judgment, to stand back.� Ultimately, Descartes locates an
unassailable position of retreat for himself which he can use to view outside
ideas and phenomena.� Descartes declares that he wants to establish an
absolutely certain foundation by locating a firm and immovable Archimedian
point of certainty.� This metaphor parallels the Albertinian notion of
perspective, in which the entirety of the visual world converges on a point
within the eye of the spectator.� He locates his firm and unshakable point of
view in the reflexive self-identity of thought.� Although Descartes can always
subject the reality external world to doubt, he affirms the absolute reality of
his own existence.� He explains �He who says, �I think, therefore I am or
exist,� does not deduce existence from thought by a syllogism, but by a simple
act of mental vision.�<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
By visually observing himself as a thinker and a doubter, Descartes concludes
that the �I� which speculates necessarily exists.� Descartes thereby creates a
detached, internal space from which he can present to himself not only external
phenomena, but also his own internal space.� Descartes thereby gains mastery
over the external world and an internal subjectivity by positing both as
objects for the philosophical spectator.� </p>


<p  > Although
Descartes decides upon the indubitability of this internal self-reflexive
vision, he must verify whether his sight also correlates with external
reality.� Just as a demon of the utmost power could utterly distort his vision,
only an omnipotent God can lead him to the truth.� Descartes deduces the
existence of God by concluding that the idea of an infinite God must have been
put in his mind by the power of God.� Descartes remarks that he would like to
pause in order to �gaze with wonder on the beauty of this immense light, as far
as the eye of my darkened intellect can bear it.�<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
this remarkable passage, Descartes concedes that even his supreme power of
mental vision can not penetrate the Being of God.� However, even though he
admits that God exists outside of his human horizons, Descartes can only
approach God as an <i>idea</i>, as an object for human contemplation.�
Descartes effects a <i>reduction ad hominem</i> by referring even the Being of
God back to the epistemological problem of human knowledge.� Furthermore, even
though Descartes insists upon God�s infinite Being and discusses his importance
as the guarantor of perception, he conspicuously avoids contemplating God�s
omniscience.� Although he occasionally mentions God�s knowledge, he never takes
it up as a topic which deserves much meditation.� Descartes thereby breaks with
a long tradition of Christian thought by practically ignoring God�s role as the
divine judge of and spectator over his creation.� Instead, he refers all
phenomena back to the human spectator, presenting the problem of judgment as a
problem which the human� mind must solve on its own by finding certainty within
itself.</p>


<p  > Descartes
distinguishes between two visual faculties which the mental eye employs: the
power of imagination and the power of understanding.� Descartes explains this
distinction: �When the mind understands, it in some way turns towards itself
and inspects one of the ideas which are within it; but when it imagines, it
turns towards the body and looks at something in the body which conforms to an
idea understood by the mind or perceived by the senses.�<a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Descartes figures both understanding and imagination as establishing a relation
between the speculative subject and an inspected object.� Descartes privileges
understanding because, through it, the mind reflects upon the mind,
establishing an immediate relationship between a thought and the object of
thought.� Conversely, because imagination operates through the medium of the
physical body, its vision always lies open to doubt.� Descartes denigrates his
imagination so much that he declares, �Besides this, I consider that this power
of imagining which is in me, differing as it does from the power of
understanding, is not a necessary constituent of my own essence, that is, of
the essence of my mind.� For if I lacked it, I should undoubtedly remain the
same individual as I now am; from which it seems to follow that it depends on
something distinct from me.�<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to this statement, man�s relationship with the external world does
not constitute a necessary part of the his identity.� Descartes, in his
statement �<i>cogito ergo sum, </i>� grounds man�s existence upon his capacity
to cogitate securely.� Following this logic, Descartes reasons that, because
the imagination opens upon an uncertain visual field, the self does not require
it.� Not only is imagination unreliable, its vision can corrupt the mind�s
sight, rendering it susceptible to extreme deception, �It is not reliable
judgment but merely some blind impulse that has made me believe up till now
that there exist things distinct from myself which transmit to me ideas or
images of themselves through the sense organs or in some other way.�<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[12]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
this statement, Descartes admits that his imagination, the mental faculty which
orients itself towards sensory phenomena, might actually blind the higher
faculty of understanding.� By deriving this blindness from an �impulse,�
Descartes seems to draw a correlation between this faulty judgment and man�s
incapacity to restrain his will.� </p>


<p  > Descartes�
insecurity arises not only from the uncertainty of sensory information, but
also from the uncontrollable fluctuations of his will.� Descartes frequently
laments that, although his mind may fix upon a true idea, his impulses may
rupture his awareness.� For example, after proving the existence of God,
Descartes remarks, �All this is quite evident by the natural light, but when I
relax my concentration, and my mental vision is blinded by the images perceived
by the senses, it is not so easy for me to remember [why God must necessarily
exist.]�<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[13]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Descartes� impulse to attend to sensory impression disrupts his security
because it subjects him to the destabilizing force of temporality.� He explains
that true ideas only provide a foundation for certainty during the time that
the thinker contemplates them.� Even the bedrock of security, �<i>cogito, ergo
sum,</i>�� is only necessarily true �whenever it is put forward by me or
conceived in my mind.�<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[14]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
However, temporality inevitably disrupts the thinker�s attention, subjecting
his judgment to the indeterminacy of his will.� Descartes explains that the man
falls into error because �the scope of the will is wider than that of the
intellect.�<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[15]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
That is, man makes mistakes because he decides to accept beliefs without having
properly considered them.� Furthermore, Descartes seems to imply that the will
can deceive the intellect because its perspective opens upon a larger visual
field, a wider scope.�� By recommending the use of the intellect, Descartes in
effect urges the thinker to narrow his viewpoint.� Descartes recommends, �it is
clear by the natural light that the intellect should always precede the
determination of the will.�<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Just as Descartes resisted the demon�s deception through the negative power of
withholding judgment, he again embraces the importance of maintaining security
by standing back and restraining the force of the will.� </p>


<p  > Throughout
his work, Nietzsche opposes the spectatorial paradigm of rationalism which
emphasizes clarity and certitude over passion and will.� Rather than critiquing
the primacy of sight, however, he suggests that men should use a new mode of
productive, poetic vision to enrich their lives.� He asserts, �both art and
life depend wholly on the laws of optics, on perspective, and illusion; both,
to be blunt, depend on the necessity of error.�<a href="#_ftn17"
name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Opposing the rationalist search for certain truth, Nietzsche embraces the power
of appearances to create new aesthetic visions for life.� In <u>Birth of
Tragedy</u>, Nietzsche condemns the spectatorial paradigm through his analysis
of Euripides and Socrates, the Alexandrian tragedian and philosopher.� Nietzsche
describes Euripides going to the theater as a �troubled spectator.� In the end
he had to admit to himself that he did not understand his great predecessors.�<a

Similarly, Nietzsche describes Socrates looking out at the world: �Wherever his
penetrating gaze fell he saw nothing but lack of understanding, fictions
rampant. ... Socrates believed it was his mission to correct this situation.�<a

Descartes, both Euripides and Socrates station themselves as the analytical
judges of what they see.� Rather than celebrating the passionate intensity of
life, they find themselves estranged from the irrationality of it.� To remedy
this situation, these two writers establish a vision which eradicates these
frightening contingencies.� Just as Descartes emphasizes clarity and
distinctness as criteria for truth, Socrates and Euripides replace passionate
Athenian aesthetics with transparent knowledge and with the doctrine that
everything beautiful must be sensible.� Nietzsche draws an explicit connection
between the Cartesian and the Alexandrian project, saying, �Euripides thought
he noticed that during those early scenes the spectators were in a peculiar
state of unrest ... Very often it was a god who had to ... remove any possible
doubt as to the reality of the myth; exactly as Descartes ... appealed to God�s
veracity.�<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span

Like Descartes, Euripides, worrying about the visual threat of uncertainty,
appeals to divine assurance for a guarantee of the accuracy of perception.�
Again like Descartes, Euripides resolves his anxiety by imposing his
spectatorial position upon aesthetic experience.� Nietzsche explains,
�Euripides succeeded in transporting the spectator onto the stage ... through
him the common man found his way from the auditorium onto the stage.� The
mirror, which previously had shown only the great and bold features, now took
on the kind of accuracy that reflects also the paltry traits of nature.�<a

Whereas the tragic stage once displayed the epic clash of mysterious, primal
forces, Euripides changes it to something which appeals to the moral
sensibility of the chorus.� Euripides converts a dangerous, heroic social space
into one which embodies the consciousness of the masses.� Therefore, Nietzsche
accuses rational spectatorship of using reason to devitalize life of all its
irrational passion.</p>


<p  > Nietzsche
asserts that Socrates with his �great Cyclops eye ... was unable to look with
any pleasure into the Dionysian abysses.�<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"

This remark critiques the Albertinian notion of an absolute perspective, the
perception of the Cartesian cogito, which absorbs the entirety of the world
within the single eye of the perceiver.� This monocular desire for certain
knowledge, however, can not cope with the uncertainty of the Dionysian
universe.� Nietzsche explains further, saying, �Like the artist, theoretical
man takes infinite pleasure in all that exists and is thus saved from the
practical ethics of pessimism with its lynx eyes that shine only in the dark.�
But while the artist, having unveiled the truth garment by garment, remained
with his gaze fixed on what is still hidden, theoretical man takes delight in
the cast garments and finds his highest satisfaction in the unveiling process
itself, which proves to him his own power.<span >�</span><a

this rich passage, Nietzsche distinguishes between the artistic and the
rational modes of vision.� The artist tries to interpret parts of the world,
but always remains aware of the nihility underlying it.� Conversely, the
rationalist, in order to rid himself of his feelings of impotence, takes a perverse
pleasure in trying to rationalize everything.� Nietzsche explains that
�Socratic perception ... moves to encompass the whole world of phenomena in
ever widening circles and knows no sharper incentive to life than the desire to
complete the conquest, to weave the net absolutely tight�<a href="#_ftn24"

Thus, Nietzsche argues that the desire to control what he fears motivates the
rational spectator to secure a certain knowledge.� However, the rationalist can
never securely understand the world from an absolute perspective.� Nietzsche
repeatedly observes that the rationalist perspective merely takes over an
illusory point of view.� Far from providing enlightenment, the rational
spectator had to �make a bargain with the power of darkness�<a href="#_ftn25"

secure his knowledge.� The rationalist project �serves only to raise appearance
- the realm of <i>Maya</i> (illusion) - to the status of true reality, thereby
rendering impossible a genuine understanding of that reality.�<a href="#_ftn26"

pursuing the rationalist project, a philosopher can never actually understand
the nature of the universe; all he does is attach too much significance to
illusory phenomena.� Instead of trying to comprehend the nihility underlying
existence, his single eye narrows the scope of his vision so much that he
merely becomes obsessed with insignificant minutiae.� Rather than gaining any
true insights, the rationalist winds up �blinding himself miserably over dusty
books and typographical errors.�<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span

<p  > Nietzsche
uses the metaphor of the artist influenced by the gods Dionysus and Apollo to
oppose the rational Alexandrian tradition.� Rather than opposing the primacy of
vision, Nietzsche uses these deities to explore new modes of sight.� As he
remarks, the artistic community which is influenced by both of these gods
produces �collective visions and hallucinations.�<a href="#_ftn28"

Nietzsche claims that the Dionysian power, most frequently manifested in music,
does not depend on vision.� Following Schopenhauer, he asserts that the deeper
force of will underlies the phenomenal world.� He remarks, �everyday reality,
too, is an illusion, hiding another, totally different kind of reality.�<a
href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[29]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Nietzsche argues that music manifests this underlying non-visible force of
will.� He states, �music ... manifests itself as will ... will is the
non-aesthetic element <i>par excellence.</i>� Rather, we should say that music
appears as will.�<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span

According to Nietzsche, the force of will exists before and transcends visible
phenomena.� Although music originates from the invisible Dionysian will, the
musician can represent this will as a concrete phenomenon by calling upon the
visual, Apollonian power.� He explains that �[Schiller], prior to composing,
experienced not a logically connected series of images but rather a <i>musical
mood </i>... This music becomes visible to him again, as in a dream similitude,
through [Apollonian forces]�<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[31]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this passage, Nietzsche describes music as a mood which exists prior to
vision yet which inspires visions.� By mediating the Dionysian realm, music can
�endow images with supreme significance.�<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[32]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Nietzsche explains that pure Dionysiac arts, �insist that we look for this
delight not in the phenomenon but behind them. ... It forces us to gaze into
the horror of individual existence, yet without being turned to stone by this
vision.�<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[33]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Rather than allowing a spectator to maintain a state of rational detachment,
Dionysian art forces the participant to confront the horrifying abyss at the
ground of existence.� By doing so, it transforms the viewer into a heroic
Perseus who faces his Medusa, yet survives the encounter.� When Dionysian music
is combined with Apollonian vision, �music forces us to see more, and more
inwardly than usual ... our spiritualized vision beholds the world of the stage
at once infinitely expanded and illuminated from within.�<a href="#_ftn34"
name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[34]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Although the primary source of the images is Apollonian, the Dionysian force
also has a visual function.� Music causes the viewer to see the work against
the background of the abyss of nothingness, deepening his vision and
illuminating the visible object.</p>


<p  > As
the dialectical counterpart to Dionysus, Apollo grants the artist the power to
create illusions.� Apollo opposes Dionysus by restraining men from being
absorbed by the nihilistic will underlying reality.� Nietzsche asserts, �the
Greeks were for a while quite immune from these feverish excesses. ... What
kept Greece safe was the proud, imposing image of Apollo, who ... subdued the
brutal and grotesque Dionysian forces.�<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[35]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Thus, Apollo, expressed as a visual image, exerts the power which protects men
from the horror of the Dionysian abyss.� Just as Descartes tried to control the
irrationality of the empirical world, Nietzsche argues that empirical existence
founds itself upon the effort to repress knowledge of nothingness.� However,
the Appolonian artist does not retreat from this abyss to a small point of
security.� Instead, he produces an illusion over the illusory phenomenal
world.� This poetic intensification of illusion enables men to enjoy life
fully.� Apollo thereby complements Dionysus: �[Dionysian] music becomes visible
to [the artist] again, as in a dream similitude, through the Apollonian dream
influence.�<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[36]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Thus, Nietzsche claims the Apollonian power enables the Dionysian will to
finally establish itself within a concrete form.� According to Nietzsche, �[Apollo],
who is etymologically the �lucent� one, the god of light, reigns over the fair
illusion of our inner world of fantasy.�<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[37]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In Apollo, Nietzsche valorizes a new form of poetic visuality.� Unlike the
natural light guiding Descartes� mental vision, this Appolonian light does not
cast doubt upon, but rather embraces, empirical appearances.� </p>


<p  > By
synthesizing these Apollonian and Dionysian forces, the artist can produce new
modes of vision in the form of theater.� In the more Apollonian tragedies of
Sophocles, the viewer finds that, �The language of the Sophoclean heroes
surprises us by its Apollonian determinacy and lucidity.� It seems to us that
we can fathom their innermost being, and we are somewhat surprised that we had
such short way to go.� However, once we ... penetrate into the myth which is
projected in these luminous phenomenon, we suddenly come up against a
phenomenon which is the exact opposite of a familiar optical one.�<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[38]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� At
first, the Sophoclean tragedy surprises the viewer with characters who seem
transparent.� By creating such characters, Sophocles seems to approach the
Alexandrian artist in his celebration of mere surface appearances.� However, as
the viewer looks deeper into the play�s source in myth, he encounters a
peculiar phenomenon. �Not only is it the opposite of an everyday visual
experience, it is also the opposite of a Platonic metaphor.� Nietzsche
continues, �After an energetic attempt to focus on the sun, we have, by way of
remedy alone, dark spots before our eyes when we turn away.� Conversely, the
luminous images of the Sophoclean heroes � those Apollonian masks � are the
necessary productions of a deep look into the horror of nature; luminous spots,
as it were, designed to cure an eye hurt by the ghastly night<span
>.�</span><a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span

>�� </span>In this passage, Nietzsche seems to be
critiquing Plato�s allegory of the cave.� In this parable, Plato describes
prisoners who have been trapped in a cave and who have been forced to watch
mere shadows on the wall.� They are liberated from their shackles and allowed
to look directly at the sun.� Although this experience blinds them at first,
they eventually grow accustomed to the sovereign light of ideal truth.� In his
analysis of Sophoclean tragedy, Nietzsche deliberately inverts this classical
paradigm of gnosis.� The Sophoclean tragedy does not allow the viewer to look
upon the light of reason, but rather confronts him with the darkness of
nothingness.� By creating a tragedy which is luminous, Sophocles cures the
viewer of the terror that this abyss causes, yet still makes him remain aware
of its underlying presence.</p>


<p  > Nietzsche
continues his attack against the spectatorial paradigm in his later works.<a

perhaps the most famous expression of Nietzsche�s perspectivism, he declares,
�Henceforth, my dear philosophers, let us be on guard against the dangerous old
conceptual fiction that posited a �pure, will-less, painless, timeless knowing
subject.�... These always demand that we should think of an eye that is
completely unthinkable, an eye turned in no particular direction, in which the
active and interpreting forces ... are supposed to be lacking.�<a href="#_ftn41"

Rationalists such as Descartes try to secure an indubitable Archimedian point
from which they can freely inspect the world.� By constructing this detached
spectatorial position, they try to secure an certain knowledge.� However,
Nietzsche asserts upon the impossibility of establishing a purely objective
subjectivity.� He argues that certain forces, certain will to powers, already
condition the ways in which an observer can regard his data.� Therefore,
Nietzsche insists that each perspective is necessarily relative because it is
contingent upon the viewer�s point of view.� �There is <i>only</i> a
perspective seeing, <i>only</i> a perspective �knowing.��<a href="#_ftn42"

>�� </span>Rather than trying to secure an absolute
perspective through abstract meditation, Nietzsche recommends that philosophers
should explore manifold viewpoints.� A philosopher should seek knowledge by
resolving �to see differently in this way for once, to <i>want</i> to see
differently ... so that one knows how to employ a <i>variety </i>�of
perspectives ... in the service of knowledge.� ... The <i>more</i> eyes,
different eyes, we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our
�concept� of the thing, our �objectivity� be.�<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[43]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to Nietzsche, the thinker can create perspectives through a wanting,
through an exertion of his own will to power.� One can only investigate
philosophical problems by understanding the will to power that animates various
perspectives.� Throughout his later work, Nietzsche investigates ideas by
appropriating the viewpoints of others.� For example, he states, �if one adopts
the only perspective known to the priest, it is not easy to set bounds to one�s
admiration of how much he has seen, sought, and found under this perspective.�<a
href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[44]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� By
willfully assuming the priest�s perspective, Nietzsche can understand the
forces which drive his thought, thereby avoiding the judgment of whether these
ideas are �right or �wrong.� </p>


<p  > Conversely,
the spectatorial tradition of rationalism posits the thinker as a judge who
masters reality through his disinterested reflections.� �Ah, reason,
seriousness, mastery over the affects, the whole somber thing called
reflection, all the prerogatives of man:� how dearly they have been bought.�<a
href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[45]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
his <u>Genealogy of Morals</u>, Nietzsche explains how human self-consciousness
developed from a brutal history of torture.� Implicating the rational tradition
in this history of violence, he asserts that cultural forces viciously
repressed men�s barbarous wills in order to invent the power of self-conscious
reflection.� Nietzsche mocks this notion of detached, self-reflexive thinking
using the example of Kant, who �considered art and the beautiful purely from
[the point of view] of the spectator. ... If [Kantian aestheticians continue to
assert that] one can <i>even</i> view undraped female statues �without
interest,� one may laugh a little at their expense.�<a href="#_ftn46"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;

Claiming that one can not gaze at the world without being influenced one�s
instincts and desires, Nietzsche argues against the notion a detached
spectator.� Ultimately, the claim of pure objectivity merely demonstrates a
certain evasiveness.� As Nietzsche asserts, �science today is a <i>hiding place</i>
for every kind of ... bad conscience � it is the unrest of the <i>lack</i> of
ideals.�<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span

According to this passage, �objectivity� merely connotes a cowardly retreat
from the world.� Rather risking himself by asserting a strong will to power,
the scientific thinker holes himself up within the security of his internal
space.� According to Nietzsche, the insincere pretense of objectivity merely
masks complacency.� By lazily sitting back and pretending to be disinterested,
the contemplative spectator only demonstrates how much he fears a true
engagement in the world, a powerful assertion of his will to power.� Nietzsche
expresses his contempt for this disengaged attitude, saying, �such �spectators�
dispose me against the �spectacle� more than the spectacle itself...[my foot
should be] kicking to pieces these rotten armchairs, its cowardly contemplativeness.�<a

<p  > Nietzsche
associates the tradition of rational spectatorship with the man of <i>ressentiment.</i>
<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;

remarks, �The inversion of the value positing eye � this <i>need</i> to direct
one�s view outward instead of back to oneself � is of the essence of <i>ressentiment</i>:�
in order to exist, slave morality always first needs a hostile external world.
... It seeks its opposite only so as to affirm itself more gratefully and
triumphantly.�<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[50]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Like the man of <i>ressentiment,</i> Descartes begins his philosophical project
by visually realizing that a hostile and contingent universe confronts him.� He
posits an uncertain external world in order to affirm the absolute reality of
his own internal viewpoint.� Nietzsche further remarks, �This type of man <i>needs</i>
to believe in a neutral, independent �subject� ... the sublime self- deception
that interprets weakness as freedom.�<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[51]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Nietzsche implies that the rationalist proclaims the primacy
of internal subjectivity because he fears to engage the external chaos with a
powerful will to power.� He therefore retreats from this confrontation by
separating himself as a spectator.� In his description of the man of <i>ressentiment,</i>
Nietzsche states that �his soul <i>squints;</i> his spirit loves hiding places,
secret paths and back doors, everything covert entices him as <i>his</i> world,
<i>his</i> security.�<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[52]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Like the man of <i>ressentiment</i>, the rationalist�s primary goal is to find
security in a chaotic world.� In order to secure this safety, the philosophical
spectator conceals himself in the privacy of his subjectivity, shutting out the
contingency of the external world.� Furthermore, Nietzsche critiques rational
ocularity by saying that the soul of the man of <i>ressentiment</i> �squints.��
In his effort to reduce his perspective to a single Archimedian, Albertinian
point, the rational spectator must squint; Descartes must narrow his �scope.��
Although squinting generally increases the clarity and distinctness of vision,
it also reduces the amount of light which the eye can receive.� Thus, in his
quest for clarity and distinctness, the spectator actually obscures another
more profound, perhaps more ominous, light.</p>


<p  > Nietzsche
suggests that the will to power can establish certain perspectives which can enable
men to assert themselves in a more healthy, more honest manner.� For example,
Nietzsche states, �not that one is the first to see something, but that one
sees<i> as new</i> what is old, long familiar, seen and overlooked by
everybody, is what distinguishes truly original minds.�<a href="#_ftn53"
name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[53]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� A
strong, creative viewpoint can refashion the commonplace by willing to see it
differently.� Not only does the will to power of the perceiver enable him to
recreate objects according to his perspective, it also enables him to recreate
himself.� Nietzsche asserts, �Most people are nothing and are considered
nothing until they have dressed themselves up in general convictions and public
opinions. ... Of the exceptional person, it must be said:� <i>only he that
wears it makes the costume.</i>�<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[54]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The powerful man�s perspectives differentiate him from the consciousness of the
unthinking masses, enabling him to refashion himself.� In <u>Ecce Homo</u>,
Nietzsche declares that his own will to power has positioned him in an
essential philosophical space.� The inquiry into morality depends upon the
capacity to explore and invert viewpoints.� Nietzsche remarks, �with every
increase in vitality my ability to see has also increased again. ... [I thus
learned] the psychology of �looking around the corner.�...Now I have the power
to <i>reverse</i> perspectives:� the first reason why a �revaluation of values�

With an increase in his will to power, Nietzsche�s visual power also grew
stronger.� With his new power, Nietzsche was able to look behind psychological
phenomenon to discern human motivations.� Interestingly, Nietzsche does not use
the common metaphor of seeing in greater depth, but talks about changing
perspectival angles.� Nietzsche�s will to power does not allow him to perceive
a transcendental truth, but rather enables him to shift perspectives freely.�
Although Nietzsche usually emphasizes visual angle rather than visual depth, he
also states that he longs for a powerful man who, with �his penetration <i>into</i>
reality, so that, when he one day emerges again into the light, he may bring
home the <i>redemption</i> of reality.�<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"

This statement seems to evoke the ocular models of <u>The Birth of Tragedy</u>.�
Like the tragic artist, the powerful man will be able to penetrate beyond
phenomena into the nothingness grounding reality, redeeming existence by
disclosing this abyss in an Appolonian light.� </p>

>� In his later works, Nietzsche seems determined to
avoid using ocular metaphors to explain his philosophy.� He resists using even
the most seemingly innocuous visual tropes which commonly infect everyday
speech.� In these later works, Nietzsche seems to prefer using sensory tropes
related to eating, repeatedly referring to nausea, rumination, and other
digestive phenomena.� He seems to distrust vision so much that he states,
�whoever can smell not only with his nose but with his eyes and ears [will
sense the weakness of European culture].� (<u>On the Genealogy of Morals and
Ecce Homo</u>, p. 121.� [Translated by Walter Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale.�
New York: Vintage Books, 1968.])� In this statement, Nietzsche attempts to reprioritize
the traditional hierarchy of the senses.� Rather than describing the eyes as
visual organs, Nietzsche reinscribes them as olfactory organs.</span></p>

and Time</u></span></b></a></p>



<p  > Throughout
his philosophical career, Martin Heidegger has argued that Western philosophy
has erred in the way it has brought Being to light.�� Like the works of
traditional philosophers, his <u>Being and Time</u> consistently describes the
philosophical quest as one which depends upon illumination and vision.� For
example, Heidegger explains that one must interrogate one�s everyday conception
of Being in order to discover its true ontological meaning by stating, �This
�presupposing� of Being has rather the character of taking a look at it
beforehand, so that in the light of it the entities presented to us get
provisionally articulated in their Being�<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this and many other statements, Heidegger defines the researcher as the one
who looks and the object of his research as something which is limited by the
light in which it is viewed.� According to Heidegger, all viewpoints, all
sources of illumination, and all phenomena are limited by their finitude.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[2]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
However, by �clarifying� the �obscuration�<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�imposed
upon a phenomenon, one can grasp its finitude authentically.� Heidegger bases
his philosophical methodology on his own interpretation of Husserl�s
phenomenology as a continuation of Greek thought.� He explains that, for the
Greeks, ��phenomenon� signifies that which shows itself in itself, the
manifest.� Accordingly the <span >fainomenon</span>
or �phenomena� are the totality of what lies in the light of day or can be
brought to light - what the Greeks sometimes identified simply with <span
>ta</span> <span >onta</span>
(beings.)�<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[4]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This preliminary methodological statement already contains the kernel of
Heidegger�s critique of traditional ontology.� Typically, philosophers such as
Plato have distinguished the momentary appearances of a being from an invisible
essence<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[5]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�which
enables it to exist.� Against this, Heidegger suggests that the Being of a
being depends upon the way it visibly manifests itself in the light of Being.�
He explains that just as phenomena can show themselves as what they are, they
can also show themselves as what they are not, as semblances.� That is, a
phenomenon can become obscured by misunderstandings such that it can no longer
be seen properly.� Having described the first half of the word �phenomenology,�
Heidegger turns to the second.� Heidegger asserts that the Greeks defined the
discourse of <span >logoV</span> (logos) as <span
>apofainesaV</span> (apophanasis,) a process which
lets something be seen.� Through this interpretation of logos, Heidegger posits
all verbal discourse, especially philosophical discourse, as serving a visual
function.� Taken together, Heidegger defines his phenomenological method as one
which clears the veils from semblances in order �to let that which shows itself
be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from itself.�<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[6]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� </p>


<p  > In <u>Being
and Time</u>, Heidegger attempts to bring to light the most primordial
phenomenon, <i>Dasein</i>.� Heidegger explains that Being should not be posited
as a transcendental substance which subsists outside of human existence.�
Rather, he insists that human beings are Dasein, existing literally as the
There [<i>Da</i>] where Being [<i>Sein</i>] occurs, where the temporal destiny
of the world is enacted.� Heidegger�s effort to shed light upon human existence
derives from his understanding of Dasein as the <i>Lichtung</i> for Being.� The
German term �Lichtung� translates into English as �clearing,� in the sense of a
clearing in the middle of a forest.� Heidegger draws upon this definition
especially in later writings such as his <i>Holzweges</i> (�ways through the
woods�), when he describes the thinker as one who finds a path through the
forest.� Furthermore, one creates a clearing in a forest so that one can
inhabit that space.� Therefore, the term Lichtung seems to be correlated with
Heidegger�s description of Dasein as one who dwells in Being and as one who
produces a region for dwelling. Lastly, Heidegger exploits the lexical
relationship between Lichtung and the term for light, <i>Licht</i>.� Heidegger
states, �To say that it is �illuminated� means that as Being-in-the-world, it
is cleared in itself, not through any other being, but in such a way that it is
the clearing [Lichtung.]�<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[7]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
In this statement, Heidegger asserts that Dasein�s capacity to grasp itself and
its world through vision does not emanate from an external source.� Rather, the
light which gives Dasein the possibility to do so derives from Dasein�s own
character as the cleared space in which the duration of Being manifests
itself.� If Dasein, as the There of Being, exists as light, this would seem to
suggest that Being itself is the production of light.� Although, in his later
works, Heidegger seems to equate the process of Truth-as-uncovering with Being,
<u>Being and Time</u> does not yet specify the relationship which obtains
between Being and light. </p>


<p  > By
locating light within Dasein, Heidegger opposes the traditional philosophical
conception of truth.� Western philosophers have tended to ground truth in an
transcendental source of light.� For example, Plato, in the <u>Republic</u>,
argues that everyday entities derive their truth from ideas just like objects
owe their visibility to the luminosity of the sun.<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
his <u>Meditations on First Philosophy</u>, Descartes argues that the natural
light and the benevolent omnipotence of God provide a guarantee that an
isolated subject can acquire certain knowledge about objects.� Heidegger
severely criticizes these models of truth for radically separating the
components of truth.� In particular, he argues against the notion that truth
arises from the transcendental agreement which connects the true assertion of a
subject with a true objective fact.� Against this tradition, Heidegger argues
that philosophical truth depends upon the way that Dasein, as the <i>Lichtung</i>
of Being, discloses its own light.� Heidegger states, �In so far as Dasein <i>is
</i>its disclosedness essentially, and discloses and uncovers as something
disclosed to this extent it is essentially �true.��<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
More directly, Heidegger states, �Because the kind of Being that is essential
to truth is of the character of Dasein, all truth is relative to Dasein.�<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Rather than subsisting as a transcendental quality, Heidegger asserts that
Dasein produces the truth of its There through the way that it exists in its
There.�� Dasein uncovers entities according to the way that it involves itself
in the world.� For example, only because a Dasein approaches the matter which
collects in its belly button as lint can it ever make a true statement such as
�there is lint in my belly button.�� Not only does Dasein establish the truth
of entities through this process of uncovering, Dasein discloses the truth of
its own existence through the manner in which it approaches this existence.� </p>


<p  > In addition
to arguing that Dasein exists as the only entity in which Being manifests
itself, Heidegger further asserts that it is the only one which has the
capacity to understand Being.� Just as disclosure provides a source of light
for Dasein and perhaps for Being itself, this activity of understanding acts as
the ground of vision.� Heidegger explains, �In its projective character,
understanding goes to make up existentially what we call Dasein�s �<i>sight</i>.�
... [The expression �sight�] corresponds to the �clearedness� which we took as
characterizing the disclosedness of the �there.�� In giving an existential
signification to �sight,� we have merely drawn upon the peculiar feature of
seeing, that it lets beings which are accessible to it be encountered unconcealedly
in themselves.�<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Just as Heidegger follows traditional philosophers by grounding truth in light,
he similarly asserts that the self establishes all of its relationships with
the world through sight.� Opposing the spectatorial tradition, Heidegger contends
that the existential capacity of understanding does not merely observe beings
which independently subsist in the world.�� Rather, Dasein always directs its
vision back at its own disclosedness.� In the above citation, Heidegger states
that Dasein�s vision �corresponds� to its disclosedness, but does not specify
the nature of this correspondence.� However, he also explains, �With the
disclosedness of the �there,� this sight is existentially; and Dasein <i>is </i>this
sight equiprimordially...� <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[12]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This seems to suggest that, for Heidegger, Dasein�s vision is existentially
equivalent to the light in which it can see.� Like Aristotle who proposed that
knowledge was produced from the unity of the knower, the knowing, and the
known, Heidegger describes truth as something which is produced through a
knowing by a knower who is also the known.� This conception of truth and
understanding grounds Heidegger�s phenomenological methodology.� Because
Heidegger, as a Dasein, is a source of the light of disclosure and can light up
the truth through understanding, he can question the true meaning of Being and
of Dasein.� He can bring the Being of Dasein to light precisely because Dasein
exists as light.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger�s
most important deviation from the spectatorial tradition derives from the
correlation he always draws between Dasein�s vision and its self-assertion.�
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, many � if not all � thinkers have
correlated knowledge and power.� For example, many of the arguments in the <u>Republic</u>
rest upon the parallels which Plato draws between the individual faculty of
reason and political sovereignty.� Similarly, Descartes� effort to secure a
stable foundation for thought seems to be driven by his desire to overcome the
external contingencies which threaten his knowledge with impotence.� Although
these philosophers implicitly associate knowledge and power, most of them also
argue that the quest for truth is an almost spiritual activity in which the
knower detaches itself from worldly struggles for power.� Heidegger�s
epistemological paradigm, however, seems to follow Nietzsche�s correlation of
perspectives and wills to power by intimately connecting the truth and the
power of the individual Dasein.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[13]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In contrast to traditional epistemology which attempts to posit an external
source of light, Heidegger argues that Dasein�s self-illumination, its
disclosedness, acts as the medium where truth is established, where phenomena
manifest themselves, and ultimately where the activity of Being itself takes place.�
Dasein clarifies or obscures its disclosedness through the way that it develops
its understanding of itself.� Since Descartes, philosophy has discussed
understanding as a process through which an isolated knower achieves its
awareness of the world external to it.� Whereas the Cartesian model defines
understanding as the activity of a detached, if not disinterested, spectator,
Heidegger defines it as the way in which Dasein engages and asserts itself in
the world.� Heidegger defies Cartesian epistemology by defining understanding
as the way in which Dasein cares for the possible ways that it can exist, its
potentiality-for-Being.� He explains, �<i>Understanding is the existential
Being of Dasein�s own potentiality-for-Being; and it is so in such a way that
this Being discloses in itself what its Being is capable of</i>.�<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[14]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Understanding is not merely one activity among many, but rather the foundation
for all of Dasein�s activities.� For Heidegger, Dasein�s understanding of its
possibilities is the very basis of its existence and the most primordial
characterization of its Being.� �Possibility as an <i>existentiale</i> is the
most primordial and ultimate positive way in which Dasein is characterized
ontologically�<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[15]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
</p>


<p  > The
language which Heidegger uses when he discusses understanding demonstrates the
connection which he makes between knowledge and power.� Throughout <u>Being and
Time</u>,� his usage of visual metaphors tends to double with terminology
connoting a virile thrust or grasp.� In the quote cited above, Heidegger states,
�In its projective character, understanding goes to make up existentially what
we call Dasein�s �<i>sight</i>.��<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The spectatorial paradigm posits a viewer who observes phenomena from a
detached perspective.� In contrast, Heidegger asserts that understanding acts
as an engaged vision which �projects� [<i>Entwerfen</i>] or �throws� [<i>werfen</i>]
the possibilities of Dasein into the future.� Through this understanding,
Dasein asserts its power in and over the world, existing for-the-sake-of its
own potentiality-for-Being, giving it the freedom to choose its own Being.�
Heidegger characterizes Dasein�s existence as the past, present, and future
temporality of its self-projection.� He states, �Any Dasein has, as Dasein,
already projected itself; and as long as it is, it is projecting.� As long as
it is, Dasein always has understood itself and always will understand itself in
terms of possibilities.�� In addition to describing understanding as
projection, Heidegger discusses it as a grasp.� According to Heidegger, Dasein
grasps the possibilities it projects and projects the possibilities it grasps.�
As with projection, Heidegger explicitly assimilates vision and this grasp.�
Whereas traditional philosophers tend to describe the self�s relation to the
world as a visual perspective, Heidegger�s term for Dasein�s relationship
towards Being, comportment [<i>Verhalten</i>, from <i>halten</i>, to hold,]
suggests that this visual orientation doubles as a virile grasp which
appropriates what it sees.� Furthermore, Heidegger states, �The idea of grasping
and explicating phenomena in a way which is �original� and �intuitive� is
directly opposed to the <i>naivet� </i>of a haphazard, �immediate,� and
unreflective �beholding.��<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
In this statement, Heidegger directly contrasts the understanding which grasps
with the visual paradigm of Cartesian epistemology.� Authentic Dasein does not
stand back to observe phenomena, but rather engages itself in the possibilities
which it discloses to itself.� By seizing these possibilities in its own manner
and projecting itself upon them, Dasein brings its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being to light.� Heidegger asserts, �The sight which is
related primarily and on the whole to existence we call �<i>transparency.</i>��
We choose this term to designate �knowledge of the Self;� in a sense which is
well understood so as to indicate that here it is not a matter of perceptually
tracking down and inspecting a point called the �Self,� but rather of seizing
upon the full disclosedness of Being-in-the-world <i>throughout all</i> the
constitutive items which are essential to it, and doing so with understanding.�<a
href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[18]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Against Descartes, Heidegger insists that selfhood should not be considered an
Archimedian point of certainty or an Albertinian point of perspective.� Rather,
Dasein�s existence articulates itself through the manifold relationships it
constitutes.</p>


<p  > Because
Dasein receives the disclosure of its possibilities from the throw [<i>wurf</i>]
of its projection [<i>entwurf</i>], it experiences this self-disclosure as its
thrownness [<i>Geworfenheit</i>] in its There.� Whereas Heidegger defines
understanding as a <i>seizure</i> of possibilities, he states that a thrown
state of mind �assails� [<i>uberfallen</i>]<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[19]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Dasein.� Whereas Heidegger describes projection as Dasein�s virile grasp, he
consistently describes thrownness as Dasein�s existential submission or
surrender to the world.� Heidegger explains this submission in his discussion
of the moods which reveal Dasein�s thrownness.� �<i>Existentially, a
state-of-mind implies a disclosive submission to the world, out of which we can
encounter something that matters to us.</i>�<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[20]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In thrownness, Dasein becomes receptive to the possibilities which it discloses
to itself.� Just as Dasein asserts its thrust towards its future through its
self-projection, it receives this thrust submissively as its having-been-thrown
in the past into a factical set of circumstances.<span >�
</span>As a state of surrender which opens Dasein to influences, thrownness
presents Dasein with the possibility of either affirming the potency of its own
projections or succumbing and becoming utterly lost in its absorption in the
world.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger�s
analysis of thrownness as a existential condition of receptivity rather than
assertiveness seems to be correlated with his description of it as a source of
darkness.� Although thrownness discloses the Being of Dasein in a certain
light, an impenetrable shadow surrounds this light.� He explains �In having a
mood, Dasein is always disclosed moodwise as that entity to which it has been
delivered over in its Being; and in this way it has been delivered over to the
Being which, in existing, it has to be�<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[21]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In contrast to his descriptions of understanding, Heidegger here discusses
thrownness in the passive voice.� Through this existential condition, Dasein
receives the imperative of its own existence which it must accept.�� Beyond
this bare fact, Dasein can not divine what the source of this existence might
be.� Heidegger continues, �The pure �that it is� shows itself, but the �whence�
and the �whither� remain in darkness.�<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[22]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Therefore, the passiveness of thrownness seems to disclose the limit of
Dasein�s capacity to visually understand Being.� Heidegger asserts that Dasein
does not <i>perceive </i>its own mood, but rather <i>finds itself</i> in a
mood.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[23]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Not only does thrownness deny Dasein of its visual agency, this condition
subjects it to the gaze of the world.� Heidegger explains, �The mood brings
Dasein before the �that-it-is� of its �there,� which, as such, <i>stares it in
the face</i> with the inexorability of an enigma.�<a href="#_ftn24"
name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[24]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� </p>


<p  ><b> </b>Along
with the detached viewer, the spectatorial model posited the world as an
objective, subsistent reality for the knower to contemplate.� Therefore,
Heidegger�s notion that understanding does not merely observe the world, but
rather involves Dasein in it, requires that he rethink the Being of this
world.� Heidegger explains that Dasein approaches the world of its thrown There
through the concern which it feels for the entities manifested in this There.�
He states, �The less we just stare at the hammer-Thing, and the more we seize
hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become,
and the more unveiledly it is encountered � as equipment.�<a href="#_ftn25"
name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[25]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This statement demonstrates how Heidegger�s critique of traditional
epistemology correlates with his novel approach to ontology.� Against the
notion that entities exist independently as things-in-themselves or through the
transcendental forms which ground their Being, Heidegger asserts that the
existence of entities is defined through and as Dasein�s access to them.� �The
kind of Being which equipment possesses � in which it manifests itself in its
own right � we call �<i>readiness-to-hand</i>��<a href="#_ftn26"
name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[26]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to Heidegger, Dasein approaches entities as �ready-to-hand�, as
already referred to the power of its grasp.� A modality of visual
understanding, circumspection, guides Dasein�s seizure of the Being of
entities.� Heidegger explains, �[Using and manipulating things] has its own
kind of sight by which our manipulation is guided and from which it acquires
its specific Thingly character.� Dealings with equipment subordinate themselves
to the manifold assignments of the �in-order-to.�� And the sight which they
thus accommodate themselves is circumspection [<i>Umsicht.</i>]�<a

Through the vision of circumspection, Dasein subordinates these entities to the
function which they can serve.� Dasein discloses these ready-to-hand entities
by letting them be involved in its world as things which it can use
for-the-sake-of realizing its own potentiality-for-Being.� For example, Dasein
frees the existence of a door because this portal already refers to Dasein�s
capacity to go through it.� Furthermore, Heidegger explains that Dasein does
not only perceive isolated pieces of equipment, but rather sees how all
entities are referred towards a totality of tools which ultimately refer to
their serviceability for Dasein.� Because the appearance of entities ultimately
depends upon how Dasein has projected its understanding of its possibilities,
Heidegger defines the Being of the totality of the world as that which Dasein
can seize for its own purposes</p>


<p  > Heidegger
explains that Dasein can grasp this world through circumspection because it has
already disclosed this world through its interpretation.� Heidegger explains
that interpretation is the underlying character of understanding itself.�
Dasein articulates its understanding of its thrown condition through its
interpretation of its There.� Heidegger discusses interpretation using the
terminology both of vision and of the grasp of power.� According to Heidegger,
interpretation is grounded upon a threefold structure of a fore-having, a
fore-seeing, and a fore-conception which appropriates, views, and grasps the
interpreted entity in advance.� Similarly, he states, �As understanding, Dasein
projects its Being upon possibilities.� This <i>Being-towards-possibilities</i>
which understands is itself a potentiality for Being and it is so because of
the way these possibilities, as disclosed, exert their counter-thrust upon
Dasein ... This development of understanding we call �interpretation.��<a
href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[28]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Through interpretation, Dasein appropriates the possibilities which have been
disclosed to it by receiving the thrust of its thrownness in order to project
itself, by using its submission to the world in order to promote its own self-assertion.�
Heidegger similarly explains, �To say that �circumspection discovers� means
that the �world� which has already been understood comes to be interpreted.�
The ready-to-hand comes <i>explicitly</i> into the sight which understands.�<a
href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[29]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
By stating that this world <i>has</i> <i>already been</i> understood, Heidegger
implies that the disclosed light which grants Dasein the possibility of
understanding has itself been projected by a previous understanding.� Heidegger
explains how interpretations light up the world of concern by establishing
signs.� He states, �The peculiar character of signs as equipment becomes
especially clear in �establishing a sign.�� This activity is performed in
circumspective fore-sight out of which it arises and which requires that it be
possible for one�s particular environment to announce itself for circumspection
at any time by means of something ready-to-hand and that this possibility
itself should be ready-to-hand.�<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[30]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The disclosure of Dasein�s thrown world of circumspection depends upon the way
that it has projected its interpretation of the world.� Dasein�s foresight sets
up signs which function as ready-to-hand pointers which let other ready-to-hand
entities become accessible to the grasp and vision of Dasein.�� </p>


<p  > Dasein�s
proximity to the world of its concern tends to cause it to obscure its Being.�
Through signs, Dasein circumspectively orients itself towards the equipmental
totality of its involvement as a spatial �region� for its dwelling.� Heidegger
describes Dasein�s circumspective absorption in this region as a state of
delusion.� He explains, �[There is an] existentially positive character of the
capacity for delusion.� It is precisely because we see the �world� unsteadily
and fitfully in accordance with our moods that the ready-to-hand shows itself
in its specific worldhood, which is never the same from day to day.�<a
href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[31]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
When Dasein is thrown into a world according to its particular mood, it
discloses a particular set of factical circumstances to itself.� The delusory
character of the world necessarily arises from the temporality through which it
is revealed.� Because Dasein manifests its world through the process of <i>becoming</i>
its potentiality-for-Being,<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[32]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�the
entities within it do not display a permanent, everyday appearance.<a
href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[33]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a><b>�</b>Whereas
Dasein can understand these entities authentically in their temporary,
ready-to-hand character, it can also grasp them as semblances which subsist
permanently in a region of space.� When it does so, it loses itself in its
world by defining its own There in terms of the entities which it discloses in
its own environment. </p>


<p  > According
to Heidegger, Dasein�s existential character of fallenness tends to cause it to
conceal its own Being from itself.� Because Dasein�s There derives from its
having-been-thrown in the past, it finds itself thrown into a particular set of
�factical� circumstances in the present.� Heidegger explains, �There is a Being
which belongs to everydayness; we call this the �<i>falling</i>� of Dasein.�
This term does not express any negative evaluation, but is used to signify that
Dasein is proximally and for the most part <i>alongside</i> the �world� of its
concern.� This �absorption in...� has mostly the character of Being-lost in the
publicness of <i>das </i><i>Man</i>.� Dasein has, in the first instance, fallen
away from itself as an authentic potentiality for Being its Self and has fallen
into the �world.��<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[34]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
When Dasein falls into a factical situation, it tends to evaluate itself in the
terms dictated by that situation.� Rather than understanding the world as it
relates to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, Dasein becomes absorbed in
worldly entities and in the discourse of the anonymous public, das Man.�
According to Heidegger, fallen Dasein tends to lose itself in the demands of
the present, ignoring the legacy which it inherits from its past as well as its
projection into the future.� Heidegger therefore calls this mode of fallenness
�everydayness� because, in it, Dasein experiences existence as an eternal
present in which every day seems to be the same as every other.� Losing itself
in the everyday, Dasein tends to fall away from its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being and submerge itself in inauthenticity.� </p>


<p  > Dasein�s
temporal experience of everydayness causes it to view its There in the light of
the world.� Heidegger explains �The phenomenon of falling does not give us
something like a �night view� of Dasein ... Far from determining its nocturnal
side, it constitutes all Dasein�s days in their everydayness.�<a href="#_ftn35"
name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[35]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
According to Heidegger, the eternally present day of everydayness causes Dasein
to fall into inauthenticity because it shines a consistent, unchanging light on
entities.� He explains that, due to the influence of tradition, everyday Dasein
discloses Being in a manner that covers it over.� He states, �...Everyone uses
it constantly and already understands what he means by [the concept Being.]� In
this way, that which the ancient philosophers found continually disturbing as
something obscure and hidden has taken on a clarity and self-evidence that if
anyone continues to talk about it he is charged with an error of method.�<a
href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[36]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� He
further asserts, �When tradition becomes master, it does so in such a way that
what it �transmits� is made so inaccessible, proximally and for the most part,
that it rather becomes concealed.� �Tradition takes what has come down to us
and delivers it over to self-evidence.�<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[37]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
In these statements, Heidegger insists upon the obscurity of the meaning of
Being,<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[38]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�arguing
that authentic Dasein must confront its fundamental strangeness to understand it.�
In everydayness, however, the pallid illumination of self-evidence lights up
Being for everyone as if it were unremarkable and obvious.� Furthermore, by
criticizing the notion of �clarity,� Heidegger equates this superficial light
with the Cartesian emphasis on clear and distinct perception.� Rather than
actually enabling people to authentically understand Being, the light which
Cartesian philosophy sheds blinds individuals to the ontological meaning of
Being and of Dasein itself.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger
asserts that Dasein�s everyday involvement with das Man prevents it from
authentically viewing its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.� He explains that,
within the There of Dasein, it encounters other unique Daseins through the
visual modalities of considerateness and forbearance [<i>R�cksicht und
Nachsicht.</i>]� Dasein�s everydayness, however, tends to obscure this vision.�
�This Being-with-one-another dissolves one�s own Dasein completely into the
kind of Being of �the Others� in such a way, indeed, that the Others, as distinguishable
and explicit, vanish more and more.�<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[39]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In its everydayness, Dasein treats other Daseins inconsiderately, failing to
respect their individuality.� Instead, Dasein views the world as constituted by
a homogeneous mass of people.� Rather than attending to its own possibilities,
Dasein becomes a spectator to life, <i>watching over</i> the ways in which it
differs from das Man.� By doing so, Dasein allows itself to become swallowed up
in this mob mentality.� When it loses itself in its identification with das
Man, Dasein lets das Man regulate the ways in which it can view its world.��
Heidegger explains that das Man makes Dasein see its possibilities in the
modality of averageness.� He states, �Das Man prescribes one�s state of mind
and determines what and how one �sees��<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[40]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Therefore, �We have <i>the same thing</i> in view, because it is in <i>the same</i>
averageness that we have a common understanding of what is said.�<a
href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[41]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to Heidegger, Dasein�s involvement with das Man causes it to adopt
das Man�s standards for evaluating its world and its existence.� Das Man
dictates to Dasein the way in which it can view its world.� Inevitably, it
mandates a viewpoint which any anonymous person can take over, a perspective
which Dasein has not seized as its ownmost.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger
insists that this average way of seeing monitors Dasein in order to prevent it
from projecting any of its unique and exceptional possibilities �In this
averageness with which it prescribes what can and may be ventured, it <i>keeps
watch over</i> everything exceptional that <i>thrusts itself</i> to the fore.�<a
href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[42]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Das Man effectively obscures Dasein�s Being from itself by disclosing
possibilities ambiguously.� �When, in our everyday Being-with-one-another, we
encounter the sort of thing which is accessible to everyone, and about which
anyone can say anything, it soon becomes impossible to decide what is disclosed
in a genuine understanding and what is not�<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[43]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to Heidegger, the public mode of disclosure covers over possibilities
with facades, making them appear as if they are well-understood phenomenon when
they are actually mere semblances.� �Everything looks as if it were genuinely
understood, genuinely taken hold of, genuinely spoken, though at bottom it is
not; or else it does not look so, and yet at bottom it is.�<a href="#_ftn44"
name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[44]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Therefore, das Man�s average seizure and interpretation of possibilities
prevents Dasein from viewing these possibilities clearly.� Not only does das
Man control the way in which phenomenon are disclosed, it also determines the
way in which Dasein approaches its world.� By losing itself in its
everydayness, Dasein learns to view the world inauthentically.� �Care becomes
concern with possibilities of seeing the �world� merely as it <i>looks </i>...
Curiosity has become free, it concerns itself with seeing, not in order to
understand what is seen (that is, to come into a Being towards it) but <i>just </i>in
order to see.� It seeks novelty only in order to leap from it anew to another
novelty�<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[45]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
According to Heidegger, just as everydayness hides authentic possibilities as
semblances, everyday Dasein dims down its power of sight so that it can not
view any possibilities authentically.� Rather than seizing and projecting its
possibilities as its ownmost, everyday Dasein develops the attitude of a
disengaged spectator who merely observes the world as it passes by. </p>


<p  > Heidegger�s
discussion of das Man�s distortion of Dasein�s visual possibilities doubles as
a discussion of das Man�s power over Dasein.� Heidegger asserts that, in its
everydayness, Dasein does not exist as its own Self, but rather as a
�they-Self� [<i>Man-selbst</i>] which is thoroughly mastered by das Man, �the
�nobody� to whom every Dasein has already surrendered itself in
Being-among-one-another.�<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[46]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
As with his analysis of Thrownness, Heidegger describes Dasein�s relationship
to das Man using terms such as �surrender� and �submission.�� He asserts that
this mob mentality dominates Dasein�s very mode of existence by mandating a
publicly acceptable way for it to act.� By doing so, das Man snatches away
Dasein�s sovereign power to project its possibilities as its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being.� Heidegger explains that, when one Dasein interacts
with another, it can dominate the Other by leaping in for it.� �This kind of
solicitude takes over for the Other that with which he is to concern himself.�
The Other is thus thrown out of his own position; he steps back so that
afterwards, when the matter has been attended to, he can either take it over as
something finished and at his disposal, or disburden himself of it completely.�
In such solicitude the Other can become one who is dominated and dependent,
even if this domination is a tacit one and remains hidden from him.�<a
href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[47]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This description of leaping ahead anticipates Heidegger�s analysis of das Man�s
effect upon Dasein.� According to him, �the real dictatorship of das Man�<a
href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[48]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�dominates
Dasein by seizing its unique possibilities away from it and converting them
into possibilities which anybody could undertake.� Das Man disburdens Dasein of
its own responsibility for its own potentiality-for-Being by making it
complacently accept the public status quo.� </p>


<p  > According
to Heidegger, das Man exerts its domination over Dasein�s possibilities by
imposing its public interpretations through its public discourse.� Although
Heidegger�s later work discusses the positive ways in which Being manifests
itself through language,<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[49]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�<u>Being
and Time</u> consistently demonstrates Heidegger�s suspicion of speech.�
Throughout this work, Heidegger subordinates linguistic expression to visual
understanding.� He defines communication as �letting someone see with us what
we have pointed out by giving it a definite character.� That which is shared is
our <i>Being towards</i> what has been pointed out. ... That which is put
forward can be passed along in �further retelling.�� There is a widening of the
range of that mutual sharing which sees.�<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[50]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
For Heidegger, discourse functions as a means by which a unique optical
perspective can be rendered publicly accessible.� Through it, Dasein can share
its understanding of its Being with other Daseins.� Although Dasein, as an
entity who exists as Being-with-Others, must necessarily share its visions,
this sharing also opens up possibilities for distortion. Heidegger continues,
�However, what has been pointed out may become veiled again in further
retelling.�<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[51]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
By allowing its understanding of its ownmost possibility-for-Being to be
influenced by Others, Dasein risks losing sight of its own choices.� By
referring to das Man as a <i>dictatorship</i>, Heidegger implies that it
exercises its power through its <i>dictation</i>, through its speech.�
According to him, its �blind and isolated categorical assertions� prevent
Dasein from disclosing its own possibilities to itself.��� </p>


<p  > Heidegger
asserts that the public sphere most severely distorts Being by interpreting it
as a set of independent, self-subsistent entities.� Heidegger expands upon this
idea in his distinction between the categorical and the existential.� He
states, �Because Dasein�s character of Being are defined in terms of
existentiality, we call them �<i>existentialia </i>� ... When used
ontologically, this term [<span >kathgoreisqai</span>:�
categorical] means taking a being to task, as it were, for whatever it is as an
entity <span >�</span> that is to say, letting everyone
see it in its Being.�<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[52]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Heidegger distinguishes two characterizations of beings and
two modes of understanding Being.� He insists that, because Dasein�s
existential projection constitutes its Being, it can only be understood in
existential terms.� Conversely, other beings can be defined categorically
according to their distinct characteristics.� Categorical thought originates
from Dasein�s Being-with Others.� Heidegger explains that Dasein encounters
other Daseins through the work world which they have in common.� He asserts
that das Man effectively distracts Dasein�s vision from its ownmost
possibilities and focuses it upon the beings within the common work world.� As
mentioned before, Heidegger defines Dasein as the clearing which is itself the
source of light in its There.� However, Heidegger claims that �Dasein is
inclined to fall back upon its world (the world in which it is) and to
interpret itself in terms of that world by its reflected light.�<a
href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[53]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to this statement, everyday Dasein veils its existential status by
allowing itself to be defined by the entities which it itself manifests.� It
does so by giving these entities the definite character of
present-at-handness.� Heidegger explains, �If knowing is to be possible as a
way of determining the nature of the present-at-hand by observing it, then
there must first be a <i>deficiency </i>in our having-to-do with the world
concernfully.� When concern holds back [<i>Sichenthalten</i>] from any kind of
producing, manipulating, and the like, it puts itself into ... the mode of just
tarrying alongside. ...� This kind of Being towards the world is one which lets
us encounter beings within-the-world purely in the <i>way they look </i>[<span
>eidoV</span>], just that.�� By adopting the public
viewpoint that the world consists of subsistent, present-at-hand beings, Dasein
conceals its own concerned involvement in the world.� That is, Dasein obscures
the fact that the world of entities ultimately refers back to its own
projection of its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.� Whereas Heidegger states
that understanding Dasein always has a certain comportment [Verhalten] towards
Being, he argues that, just like Descartes affirms his power by withholding
judgment, �tarrying� Dasein holds itself back [Sichenthalten] from the world.� </p>


<p  > According
to Heidegger, everyday Dasein refrains from properly seizing the world around
it as ready-to-hand by viewing the world as having an existence independent of
its own projection.� Although these entities, as present-at-hand, still refer
back to the grasp of Dasein, Dasein avoids employing them to promote its own
possibilities.� By viewing and grasping the world as merely present-at-hand,
Dasein misunderstands the temporal structure of its own existence.� As cited
above, Heidegger states that discourse �lets someone see with us what we have
pointed out by giving it a definite character�<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[54]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
He expands upon this notion of defining the character of entities in his
discussion of Descartes� analysis of substance. �Such entities are those <i>which
always are what they are</i>.� Accordingly, that which can be shown to have the
character of something that <i>constantly remains</i> (as <i>remanens capax
mutationum</i>,) makes up the real Being of those entities of the world which
get experienced.� That which enduringly remains, really <i>is</i>.�<a
href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[55]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Everyday Dasein conceives of Being as constituted by a set of self-subsistent
objects whose Beings are independent from Dasein�s existence and are grounded
by distinct, eternal essences.� By analyzing Being as present-at-hand, Dasein
concludes that Being is something which has a permanent substance and which
manifests itself in a fixed manner during every present moment.��� According to
Heidegger, this obscures the fact that Dasein�s Being exists as a dynamic <i>becoming</i>
in which it projects its possibilities into the future.</p>


<p  > In
the final chapter of <u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger seems to claim that the
misinterpretation of time lies at the root of all misunderstanding of Being.�
He asserts that �temporality is estatico-horizonally constitutive for the
clearedness of the There,�<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[56]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�meaning
that time, as the horizon of meaning of Being and of Dasein, constitutes the
light in which Dasein discloses itself.� However, he claims everyday Dasein
interprets time as some familiar ready-to-hand or present-at-hand thing.�
Heidegger invents a mythic narrative to explain how Dasein�s knowledge of this
internal temporal light-source has been obscured.� He states, �Everyday circum<i>spective</i>
Being-in-the-world needs the <i>possibility of sight</i> (and this means that
it needs brightness) if it is to deal concernfully with what is ready-to-hand
within the present-to-hand. ... In its thrownness Dasein has surrendered to the
changes of day and night. ... The �then� with which Dasein concerns itself gets
dated in terms of something which is connected with getting bright, and which
is connected with it in the closest kind of environmental involvement � namely,
the rising of the sun.�<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span

Because Dasein�s Being, its existential self-projection, depends upon its
vision of possibilities, it relies upon the light which illuminates these
possibilities.� Although Heidegger argues that this light ultimately emanates
from Dasein�s status as a <i>Lichtung</i>, it receives this disclosedness in
its thrownness.� It therefore does not experience this light in its
self-assertion, but rather as something to which it has surrendered itself.�
Submitting itself to the world, concerned Dasein tends to interpret itself in
terms of the world, and tends to interpret its own temporal illumination as dependent
upon the ready-to-hand sun.� For Heidegger, this misinterpretation of the sun
serves as the paradigmatic example of Dasein�s interpreting itself in the
reflected light of the world.� Furthermore, by viewing the sun as a substitute
for the temporal clearedness which discloses existential possibilities, he
opposes an entire philosophical tradition which, starting with Plato,
interpreted the sun as the source of theoretical intelligibility.� </p>


<p  > According
to Heidegger, das Man veils the essence of temporality even further by
converting it into something which is present-at-hand.� With the ready-to-hand
interpretation of temporality, Dasein interprets the sun as it refers to its
own possibilities.� For example, farmer Dasein interprets daybreak as the time
to feed his livestock and Mexican Dasein interprets high noon as the time to
take a siesta.� The public realm, however, veils the personal relevance of this
temporal light.� Heidegger states, �The dating of things in terms of the
heavenly body which sheds forth light and warmth, and in terms of its
distinctive �places� in the sky, is a way of assigning time which can be done
for �Everyman� at any time in the same way.�<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58"

position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[58]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The public interpretation of temporality distances Dasein even further from
Dasein�s Being.� By making time a generalized commodity, das Man posits it as
an external thing which Dasein can observe from the outside rather than
something upon which Dasein projects its very existence.� Anticipating his
essays on technology, Heidegger finally warns, �For the �advanced� Dasein the
day and the presence of sunlight no longer have such a special function as they
have for the �primitive� Dasein on which our analysis of �natural�
time-reckoning has been based; for the �advanced� Dasein has the �advantage� of
even being able to turn night into day.�<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[59]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger suggests that, through a perverse technological alchemy, the public
realm of modernity has distorted the authentic interpretation of temporal
clearedness through its invention of time pieces which do not depend on
sunlight, and also, it seems, through its invention of mechanical lighting
systems.� The modern interpretation of time has completely veiled the temporal
self-illumination of Dasein by disclosing time as merely a series of measurable
and datable moments which subsist independently of Dasein�s Being.</p>


<p  > To
overcome the distortions of das Man, Heidegger insists that Dasein must engage
in a violent struggle for the truth of its Being.� For example, describing his
methodology, Heidegger states, �The way in which Being and its structures are
encountered in the mode of phenomenon is one which must first of all be <i>wrested</i>
from the objects of phenomenology.�<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[60]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Not only does Heidegger correlate the quest for truth with a grasp, this grasp
requires a violent exertion of Dasein�s power.� Because das Man has totally
concealed phenomena as being merely present-at-hand, authentic Dasein must
fight against das Man�s interpretations and discover the meaning of its own
possibilities.� Heidegger asserts that Dasein must grasp truth violently to
clarify its vision from the viewpoint mandated by das Man.� �Common sense
concerns itself, whether �theoretically� or �practically� only with beings
which can be surveyed at a glance circumspectively� What is distinctive in
common sense is that it has in view only the experiencing of �factual� beings,
in order that it may be able to rid itself of an understanding of Being.� It
fails to recognize that beings can be experienced �factually� only when Being
is already understood, even if it has not been conceptualized.� Common sense
misunderstands understanding.� And <i>therefore</i> common sense must
necessarily pass off as �violent� anything that lies beyond the reach of its
understanding, or any attempt to go out so far.�<a href="#_ftn61"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[61]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Das Man views beings superficially as entities which have an actual identity
rather than as possibilities which exist for-the-sake-of Dasein�s ownmost
potentiality-for-Being.� Heidegger asserts that das Man resents Dasein�s effort
to seize existence as its own and interprets this as violence.� He explains
that das Man attempts to lull Dasein into a tranquil acceptance of the status
quo in order to cover up the anxiety which Dasein feels for its existence.�
Furthermore, this public realm levels off all genuine possibilities by
asserting that any unique and authentic projection could have been accomplished
by anyone.� Therefore, Dasein must break violently with the complacent
averageness which das Man inculcates, bravely asserting its own authenticity.�
Heidegger states, �Existential Interpretation will never seek to take over any
authoritarian pronouncement as to those things which, from an existentiell
point of view, are possible or binding. ... <i>Does not the violence of this
projection amount to freeing Dasein�s undisguised phenomenal content</i>,�<a
href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[62]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
this statement, Heidegger seems to distinguish two forms of violence.� His
reference to �authoritarian pronouncements� seems to be a covert critique of
das Man�s mode of interpretation.� That is, das Man dominates Dasein�s
understanding of phenomena through the public discourse it authors and through
the definitions which it pronounces.� It makes its interpretations binding by
fixing the identity of entities as things which are distinct and permanent.�
Heidegger contrasts this repressive violence with the violence which liberates
possibilities for Dasein�s projection of its potentiality-for-Being.� Heidegger
speaks of this self-realization as �the possibility that Dasein may choose its
own hero.�<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[63]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This statement conjures the image of authentic Dasein as the masculine
protagonist in a Greek tragedy who struggles courageously against the brutality
of the elements and the cowardice of other men.� For Heidegger, authentic
Dasein is the one which seizes entities as possibilities rather than as things
and which defeats the hegemony of das Man.� It is the one which struggles
against the obfuscations of the world and of the public in order to be true to
its ownmost potentiality-for-Being.� </p>


<p  > According
to Heidegger, Dasein establishes its authenticity by properly caring for its
own Being.� As mentioned before, Dasein does so by becoming transparent to
itself.� �The sight which is related primarily and on the whole to existence we
call �<i>transparency.</i>� ... [This is a matter] of seizing upon the full
disclosedness of Being-in-the-world <i>throughout all</i> the constitutive
items which are essential to it, and doing so with understanding.�<a
href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[64]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
this state of transparency, Dasein�s status as the one who sees and as the one
who is lighted coincide.� Dasein understands itself by understanding the
totality of all the existentials which articulate its existence.� Transparent
Dasein must visually understand that it exists as the illuminated There where
its Being visually projects itself towards its ownmost-potentiality-for-Being.�
It must understand that it has been thrown into a world of beings and has
fallen into an everyday set of factical circumstances, but that it can
authentically seize upon the possibilities manifested in its thrown, fallen world.�
According to Heidegger, Dasein must therefore understand that, ultimately, it
exists as the freedom to project authentic possibilities and to will its
ownmost potentiality-for-Being.� Dasein becomes transparent to itself by
authentically confronting the possibility of its death.� Heidegger states,
�[Anticipatory resoluteness is] the understanding which follows the call of
conscience and which frees for death the possibility of acquiring <i>power</i>
over Dasein�s <i>existence </i>and of basically dispersing all fugitive
Self-concealments.�<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[65]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger asserts that the possibility of death is <i>the</i> possibility of
Dasein�s Being which belongs exclusively to it, which relates to nothing
outside of it, and which can not be taken away from it.� Heidegger explains,
�This possibility of representing breaks down completely if the issue is one of
representing that possibility-of-Being which makes up Dasein�s coming to an
end, and which, gives to its wholeness.�<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[66]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
This statement describes death as the paradigmatic example of that which can
not be represented.� Heidegger distrusts representation because it detaches
Dasein from its world, positing Dasein as a subject and the world as a set of
objects, a notion embraced by Cartesian epistemology.� Furthermore,
representation conceals Dasein�s involvement in its possibilities by allowing
other Daseins to view a possibility which only Dasein itself should be able to
see.� Heidegger continues, �<i>No one can take the Other�s dying away from him</i>
... By its very essence, death is in every case mine, in so far as it �is� at
all.�<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[67]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Doubling
his terminology of vision with that of the grasp, Heidegger asserts that das
Man�s incapacity to represent death correlates with it�s inability to leap in
for Dasein to <i>take away</i>� this possibility from Dasein.� Because no one
can die someone else�s death, Heidegger insists that this mortality absolutely
individualizes each Dasein.� </p>


<p  > Although
death may strike Dasein at any moment, everyday Dasein attempts to cover over
this possibility by fleeing from its inevitability.� Heidegger explains that,
in this flight, Dasein falls into the public world of the present which is
dominated by das Man.� Through its interpretation of death, das Man makes
Dasein tranquil about the anxiety it feels for its death and denies Dasein the
heroic courage it requires to face up to this anxiety.� Das Man attempts to
represent death theoretically as an objective and familiar event which is
possible for everyone and therefore for no one in particular.� The public realm
views death from the perspective of the everyday present as something which
will occur at some datable point in the future.� Heidegger opposes this view by
saying, �Das Man covers up what is most peculiar in death�s certainty � <i>that
it is possible at any moment</i>�<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[68]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
In this statement, Heidegger seems to locate the origin of everydayness in das
Man�s covering of death.� Heidegger explains that this possibility of death is
already disclosed each time Dasein discloses itself within its There.� Therefore,
Dasein can authentically relate to death only by becoming aware of the constant
anxiety that it feels for its mortality.� Heidegger continues, �Everyday
concern makes definite for itself the indefiniteness of certain death by
interposing before it those urgencies and possibilities which can be taken in
at a glance, and which belong to the everyday matters which are closest to us.�<a
href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[69]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to him, das Man conceals the imminent futurity of death by
distracting Dasein�s visual attention from this most lucid possibility and
towards the entities which inhabit the world of its concern.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger
asserts that an authentic confrontation with death enables Dasein to break from
the domination of das Man and become transparent to itself.� He contends that
the possibility of death differs from and grounds other possibilities.� He
states, �The more unveiledly this possibility gets understood, the more purely
does the understanding penetrate into it <i>as the possibility of the
impossibility of any existence at all.</i> ... It is the possibility of the
impossibility of every way of comporting oneself towards anything, of every way
of existing. ... In accordance with its essence, this possibility offers no
support for becoming intent on something, picturing to oneself the actuality
which is possible, and so forgetting its possibility.� Being-towards-death, as
anticipation of possibility, is what first <i>makes</i> this possibility <i>possible</i>,
and sets it free as possibility�<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[70]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Death, for Heidegger, is the possibility that Dasein�s projection of its
ownmost possibilities will be rendered impossible.� However, this possibility
of impossibility makes it possible for Dasein to project its possibilities.��
By accepting this as its ownmost possibility, Dasein clarifies how it exists
towards and through its possibilities.� Because Dasein can experience the
possibility of death, but can never experience the actuality of its own death,
death effectively makes the notion of possibility independent from the notion
of actuality.� The notion of actuality functions as the terminus of
potentiality which fulfills a possibility, but which also destroys the power of
this possibility by fulfilling it.� Heidegger demonstrates that, with death,
possibility already contains its own finitude within itself.� By arguing that
the Being of possibilities does not depend on what actual, present-at-hand
result they achieve, Heidegger preserves the independent power of
possibilities.� Heidegger explains that, by accepting its Being-towards the
finitude of its possibilities, Dasein can authentically understand that its
existence is oriented towards their terminus, the futurity towards which it
projects its possibilities.� Heidegger employs this notion that a possibility
contains its own termination to critique everydayness.� For Heidegger,
everydayness represents a comportment in which one avoids committing oneself to
either the birth or the finitude of authentic possibility.� Heidegger states
that �Everydayness is that Being which is �between� birth and death.�<a
href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[71]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
<u>Being and Time</u>, death seems to figure as the night which puts an end to
all of the days in which Dasein can disclose its being to itself and project
its lighted possibilities.� In the superficial light of the everyday, das Man
refuses to gaze upon the darkness of death.� Conversely, Dasein�s authentic
confrontation with death wrenches it away from the everyday domination of das
Man and from its everyday absorption in the world of beings.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger
explains that Dasein becomes transparent to itself by listening to the call of
its conscience.� In this call, the Dasein who has become anxious about its
imminent futural death appeals to itself as the one who has fallen in the
present among das Man.� Heidegger asserts that Dasein tends to flee into the tranquillity
of the environment provided by das Man in order to conceal the precariousness
of its existence.� This call reorients Dasein�s vision.� Heidegger states that
Dasein must <i>look away</i> from its everyday experiences with entities and
with others in order to confront the uncanniness of the nothingness which
threatens its existence with its finitude.� Heidegger explains how this anxious
confrontation differs from everyday encounters with entities.� �[Anxiety] does
not have any need for darkness, in which it is commonly easier for one to feel
uncanny.� In the dark there is emphatically �nothing to see,� though the world
itself is <i>still</i> �there,� and �there� <i>more obtrusively</i>.�<a
href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[72]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Even though anxiety does not require any factical darkness, Heidegger seems to
suggest that the sight of existential darkness, like the vision of the
Dionysian abyss, discloses the true Being of Dasein�s There.� Not only does
this vision of darkness eradicate the pacifying light with which das Man
reveals the everyday existence of entities, it indicates that Dasein�s status
as the illuminated There of Being doubles as its status as the darkened There
of Being.� </p>


<p  > Just
as Heidegger describes anxious Dasein as submerged in darkness, he also
describes Dasein as submissive to the anxious voice of its own conscience.�
Because this domination comes from itself, it liberates Dasein from the
domination of the discourse of das Man.� This conscience does not only
dominate, it discloses the nothingness which is �so close that it is
oppressive.�<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[73]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��As
well as being beyond Dasein�s vision, the nothingness which conscience
discloses lies beyond its power.� Heidegger states, �The Self which as such has
to lay the basis for itself, can <i>never</i> get that basis into its power;
and yet, as existing, it must take over Being-a-basis.� In being a basis � that
is, in existing as thrown � Dasein constantly lags behind its possibilities.�
It is never existent <i>before</i> its basis, but only <i>from it </i>and<i> as
this basis</i>.� Thus �Being-a-basis� means never to have power over one�s
ownmost Being from the ground up.� This �not� belongs to the existential
meaning of �thrownness.�� It itself, being a basis, <i>is </i>a nullity of
itself�<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[74]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger explains that, because Dasein has been thrown into its There, it
exists on the basis of a nullity.� That is, it has been thrown into a factical
situation which it has not chosen.� Heidegger asserts that Dasein�s power to
project its existence therefore depends upon it being unable to control the
circumstances upon which it projects.� Whereas everyday Dasein, influenced by
das Man, pretends that it can encompass everything within its power and its
vision, this abyss of nothingness discloses that which lies outside of its
possibilities.� Whereas das Man asserts that it has already mastered all possibilities,
this nullity discloses to Dasein that it can not seize all possibilities as its
own; that, in grasping one possibility, it must forsake all of the others.��
Accepting this nullity enables Dasein to become free for authentically choosing
and projecting a potentiality-for-Being which is its ownmost.� </p>


<p  > By
resolutely disclosing the nullity which makes it anxious for its
potentiality-for-Being, Dasein acquires the vision and power to project itself
authentically.� Heidegger explains, �If Dasein, by anticipation, lets death
become powerful in itself, then, as free for death, Dasein understands itself
in its own <i>superior power</i>, the power of its finite freedom, so that in
this freedom, which �is� only in its having chosen to make such a choice, it
can take over the <i>powerlessness</i> of abandonment to its having done so,
and can thus come to have a clear vision for the accidents of the Situation
that has been disclosed.�<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[75]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In its resoluteness, Dasein becomes so transparent to itself that it
understands the mortality which dominates its existence and the nullity which
grounds it.� It understands that it has been thrown into a world and therefore
submitted to it.� It sees that it has fallen into a world dominated by das Man
and therefore become lost in it.� Rather than attempting to eradicate the
inevitable facts of its submission, Dasein appropriates its submission
authentically and thereby becomes its own master.� By dominating itself,
authentic Dasein prevents either the world of entities or of das Man from fully
controlling it.� Even though Dasein is surrendered to a set of factical
circumstances which are beyond its power, it can still assert its sovereignty
by discovering the possibilities within its world which promote the
self-assertion of its ownmost-potentiality-for-Being.� Authentic Dasein
acquires a visual capacity to perceive such possibilities.� Heidegger explains,
�When resolute, Dasein has brought itself from falling, and has done so
precisely in order to be more authentically �there� in the �moment of vision�
as regards the Situation which has been disclosed.�<a href="#_ftn76"
name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[76]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger describes the moment of vision as the authentic mode of experiencing
the ecstasis of the present.� He utilizes it to critique the inauthentic vision
of the present, curiosity, which causes Dasein to fall into the everyday world
of das Man.� According to Heidegger, curious Dasein looks at appearances in
order to make them present, thereby forgetting its heritage and awaiting future
novelties.� Rather than being absorbed by well-lighted, present-at-hand
entities, Dasein, in its moment of vision, becomes fascinated by the obscurity
of its null basis, enabling it to encounter its ownmost possibilities and
opening it up to authentic temporality.� Heidegger states, �<i>Only an entity
which, in its Being, is essentially </i><b>futural</b><i> .. which, as futural,
is equiprimordially in the process of </i><b>having-been</b><i>, can, by
handing down to itself the possibility it has inherited, take over its
thrownness and be </i><b>in the moment of vision</b><i> for its time</i>.�<a
href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[77]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Dasein discloses its present authentically in a moment of vision in which it
understands both the heritage and the futural possibilities which lie within
the factical situation of its present.� In the moment of vision, therefore,
Dasein can take over its thrown There authentically by choosing and acting upon
the possibilities which it seizes as its ownmost.� </p>


<p  > Throughout
<u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger associates Dasein�s thrownness from the past
with its submission.� Dasein masters this submission authentically by understanding
its ownmost possibilities as those which have been handed down to it
historically.� Heidegger explains that, because everyday Dasein tends to
disperse itself into the many entities with which it concerns itself, it must
create a unity to bring itself together and to embrace the totality of its
existence.� Dasein understands this unity in a moment-of-vision during which it
willingly submits itself to its heritage by seizing upon a possibility which it
has inherited from the past.� He states, �Resoluteness constitutes the <i>loyalty</i>
of existence to its own Self ... this loyalty is a possible way of revering the
sole authority which a free existing can have - of revering the repeatable
possibilities of existence.�<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[78]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
By describing historical possibility as an authority, Heidegger indicates that
the mandates of history dominate Dasein, but do so in a way which fundamentally
differs from the domination exercised by das Man.� Heidegger speaks of Dasein�s
submission to history as an act of heroism, as a self-submission, and by
extension, a self-mastery.� Furthermore, Heidegger insists that Dasein�s
existential character as a Being-with-Others requires it to involve other
Daseins in its historizing.� Dasein can do so by leaping ahead of Others in
order to disclose possibilities which will help them become transparent to
themselves.� Rather than instituting an impersonal regime in which das Man
reigns, authentic Daseins can then work together on a common project while
still preserving their authentic individuality.� Heidegger states, �But if
fateful Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, exists essentially in Being-with-Others,
its historizing is a&nbsp;co-historizing and is determinative for it as <i>destiny</i>.�
This is how we designate the historizing of a community, of a people [Volk.]�
Our fates have already been guided in advance, in our Being with one another in
the same world and in our resoluteness for definite possibilities.� Only in
communicating and in struggling does the power of destiny become free.�<a

Ominously, Heidegger extends his description of Dasein�s heroism to an entire
group of people, of a Volk, describing their effort to understand themselves as
a struggle [<i>Kampf</i>,] potentially a violent one.</p>

>� Heidegger, even in his student days, has always
displayed an affinity for Nietzsche.� I would argue that many ideas in <u>Being
and Time</u>, including the correlation between light and power, are developed
from Heidegger�s meditations on Nietzsche.� Heidegger himself seems to affirm
this comparison by recasting many of his own concepts in Nietzsche�s vocabulary
in his Nietzsche lectures, especially the first two.� However, the relationship
between Nietzsche and Heidegger is quite complex and therefore would require an
extremely nuanced discussion, one which lies outside the scope of this thesis.�
David Farrell Krell has done a lot of good work in this area.� See his <u>Daimon
Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy</u>�� [Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana
University Press, 1992.] and his <u>Intimations of Mortality</u> [University
Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1986.]� Also see Jacques
Taminiaux�s <u>Heidegger and the project of fundamental ontology</u>�

derived from Nietzsche.� Not only does he discuss the relationship between

receives its Constitution through understanding and through the character of
understanding as projection, only because it <i>is</i> what it becomes (or
alternatively, does not become,) can it say to itself �Become what you are� and
say this with understanding�� (Ibid.� p. 186/145]</span></p>

Metaphysics</u></span></b></a></p>



<p  > In 1933,
Heidegger committed himself and his thought to the National Socialism.� He
explains this engagement in a letter to his former student Herbert Marcuse, �I
expected from National Socialism a spiritual renewal of life in its entirety, a
recollection of social antagonisms and a deliverance of Western Dasein from the
dangers of communism.�<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
After the Nazis ejected Professor von M�llendorf, a Social Democrat, from the
rectorate of Freiburg University in 1933, the faculty elected Heidegger as his
replacement.� Since his 1929 essay, <i>What is Metaphysics</i>,<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[2]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Heidegger
expressed a desire to reform the scientific orientation of the German
university towards a more primordial form of knowing.� Therefore, he embraced
his new position as rector. �I was nevertheless absolutely convinced that an
autonomous alliance of intellectuals [<i>der</i> <i>Geistigen</i>, from <i>Geist</i>,
spirit] could deepen and transform a number of essential elements of the
�National Socialist movement� and therefore contribute in its own way to
overcoming Europe�s disarray and the crisis of the Western spirit.�<a

><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
During his tenure, Heidegger made a number of speeches assimilating his
philosophy to the Nazi�s spiritual-political cause.� In his 1933 Rectoral
Address <i>The Self-Assertion of the German University</i>,<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;

the faculty and students of Freiburg University to struggle towards a knowledge
that will enrich the spiritual life of the German Volk.� However, by 1934, the
Party had made clear their discomfort with Heidegger.� Because he both refused
to carry out certain Nazi commands<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

espoused a philosophy which many ideologues felt was nihilistic and potentially
dangerous,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[6]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�the
Party did not know if they could trust him to tow the ideological line and
pressured him to resign from the rectorate.� However, Heidegger still
maintained an allegiance to his vision of a �private National Socialism� until
� and even after<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[7]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
the end of the war.� Based upon a lecture course given in 1935, a year after
Heidegger resigned from the rectorate of the Freiburg University, <u>Introduction
to Metaphysics</u> attempts to establish Heidegger as the proper
spiritual-philosophical leader of National Socialism.� </p>


<p  > <u>Introduction
to Metaphysics</u> reinscribes the correlation which Heidegger draws between
power and the light of truth in a more violent, more political language.� In <u>Being
and Time</u>, Heidegger prevents a tragic pathos from overwhelming his analysis
of Dasein by maintaining the rigor of an argument whose language, even in its
radicalness, echoes the soberness of Kant.� In <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>,
this language explodes into a violent rhetoric which echoes the forcefulness of
Nietzsche and J�nger.�� Rather than employing almost scholastic categories of
projection and thrownness, which implicitly suggest a dynamic of self-assertion
and self-submission, Heidegger explicitly invokes the terminology of struggle,
of power, and of military combat.� <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u> does not
merely correlate knowledge and power; it establishes an intimacy between the
most profound philosophical knowing and the most terrible political power.�
This text does so by inscribing militarism into its language and by enlisting
its ideas in the service of Germany�s political situation.� Heidegger explains
that, as �perhaps the only real force,�<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�philosophy
must become the �thinking that breaks the paths and opens the perspectives of
the knowledge that sets the norms and hierarchies, of the knowledge in which
and by which a people fulfills itself historically and culturally, the
knowledge that kindles and necessitates all inquiries and thereby threatens all
values.�<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Heidegger�s original questioning, like Nietzsche�s revaluation of all values
hitherto, intends to disrupt the political and intellectual structures upon
which the German people has rested complacently.� By maintaining it in a state
of existential insecurity, Heidegger claims that his philosophy can challenge
the German Dasein to struggle towards its historical destiny, the �inner truth
and greatness� of National Socialism.</p>


<p  > Heidegger
spiritualizes power by positing it as the very essence of Being.� He argues
that the Greeks defined Being as physis (<span >fusiV</span>.)�
�Physis is Being itself, by virtue of which essents become and remain
observable.� Physis means the power that emerges and the enduring realm under
its sway.�<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Heidegger explains physis as the power governing temporal
appearing, reinscribing phenomenology as a study of force.� For Heidegger,
beings do not merely appear as posited within an already-created light.�
Rather, the self-exertion of the process of Being brings to light beings which
can stand for themselves, allowing the human observer to gaze upon them.�
Heidegger�s mention of �the enduring realm� under the sway of Being also seems
to posit a certain type of political relationship obtaining between the
singular Being and the manifold beings.� He explains Being through the Greek
word dike (<span >dike</span>) which he translates as
the German word <i>Fug</i> (order.)� �Here we understand Fug first in the sense
of joint and framework, then as decree, dispensation, a directive that the
overpowering imposes on its reign; finally, as the governing structure which
compels adaptation and compliance.�<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Heidegger describes Being both as a transcendent power which imposes its rule
and an immanent force which compels obedience to this rule.� Being permeates
and collects the world of beings, maintaining the tension between them.�
Because Being articulates itself as this dynamic plurality, one can certainly
read Heidegger�s analysis of Being as privileging the multiple over the
singular.� However, Heidegger himself clearly emphasizes the absolute
domination of Being.� Heidegger argues that this rule is established as
terror.� �The deinon (<span >deinon</span>) is the
terrible in the sense of the overpowering power which compels panic fear, true
fear; and in equal measure it is the collected, silent awe that vibrates with
its own rhythm.�<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[12]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Just as Being compels obedience to its rule, it compels dread over those it
rules: its sustains its domination through the terror which it inspires.<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[13]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� </p>


<p  > Unlike
Hegel, Heidegger does not describe the process of Being as one which
consummates itself.� Whereas the dynamic moments of Hegel�s system eventually
find themselves subsumed within a historical totality, Heidegger�s Being always
maintains an internal dynamic at every moment of history.� Heidegger preserves
this state of internal tension by raising the notion of struggle [<i>Kampf</i>]
to a spiritual-ontological level.� He develops this idea of a primordial
struggle through a reading of Heraclitus fragment concerning polemos (<span
>polemoV</span>.)� �This conflict, as Heraclitus
thought it, first caused the realm of Being to separate into opposites�<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[14]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� As
polemos, Being produces itself as a violent convulsion, articulating each
separate essent as an aspect of this combat.� Being manifests essents as those
who it destines to battle each other.� Not only does this interpretation of
Heraclitus approach militarism, it also seems to deliberately echo certain
German polemics against democratic egalitarianism.� Heidegger continues,
�[Polemos] first gave rise to position and order and rank. ... In the conflict
a world comes into being. �<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[15]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Like
both Nietzsche and the National Socialists, Heidegger argues for the central
importance of rank, distinguishing the weak from the mighty.� For Heidegger,
these differences between the powerful and the impotent are not merely
political or natural.� As polemos, Being itself determines these separations,
stamping each existence with its degree of potency.� Because struggle occurs in
Being as the articulation of opposition, it determines the relationship between
man and Being.� �The deinon as the overpowering (dike: <span style='font-family:
Symbol'>dike</span>) and the deinon as violent (techne: <span style='font-family:
Symbol'>tecne</span>) confront one another, though not as two given things.� In
this confrontation techne bursts forth against dike, which in turn as Fug, the
commanding order, disposes of all techne.� The reciprocal confrontation <i>is</i>.�
It is only insofar as the strangest thing of all, Being-human, is actualized,
insofar as man is present as history.�<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Heidegger italicizes the word is, which he defines as the
most pre-eminent expression of Being in language.<a href="#_ftn17"
name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Lacking any direct or indirect object, Heidegger�s sentence �the reciprocal
confrontation <i>is</i>� seems to imply that the reciprocal confrontation
between man and Being correlates with this �is,� with the process of Being
unconcealing itself.� </p>


<p  > Defined
by his struggle with Being, man�s existence constitutes itself as his
violence.� Heidegger disparages the common conception of violence as arbitrary
brutality.� �In this common usage violence is seen from the standpoint of a
realm which draws its standards from conventional compromise and mutual aid,
and which disparages all violence as a disturbance of the peace.�<a

referring to a standpoint of sight, Heidegger seems to critique the public
desire for peace as a weak visual perspective.� This viewpoint refuses to
engage in heroic conflict, indolently clinging to the complacent security of
the status quo.�� In contrast, Heidegger asserts that man is the deinon, �the
powerful in the sense of one who uses power, who not only disposes of power,
but is violent insofar as the use of power is the basic trait not only of his
action but also of his Dasein.�<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span

For Heidegger, violence does not merely characterize occasional acts of man�s
Dasein, but rather the entire dynamic of his ontological, temporal being.��
Dasein, as the There of Being, not only exposes itself to the overpowering
power of physis, it struggles against Being, exercising its power against this
overpowering force.� Heidegger continues, �Being itself hurls man into this
breaking away, which drives him beyond himself to venture forth toward Being,
to accomplish Being, to stabilize it in a work, and so hold open the essent as
a whole.� Therefore, the violent one knows no kindness and conciliation; he can
not be mollified by success or prestige.�<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"

According to this statement, Being destines man as a supreme, uncompromising
violence which neither complacent prosperity nor public accolades can
restrain.� Being overpowers man�s Dasein, shattering his stability in its
temporal flow.� This convulsive dynamic opens man up to Being, forcing him into
his conflict with Being.� Man struggles with essents by building poetically, bringing
things into the proper limits and forms which define their Being.� Heidegger
describes this shaping of Being as a struggle against elemental forces such as
the �overpowering sea� and �the indestructible power of the earth.�<a

Dasein asserts itself through its domination of the living creatures which draw
their life force from these elements.� It establishes the limits of these
creatures by subjecting them to the constraints which it imposes upon them.�
Through violent assertion, man disturbs the tranquil growth of the earth,
breaking up the ground through his agriculture, subjugating animals by tearing
them up from their natural environments, �shutting them up in his pens and
enclosures, and forcing them under his yokes.�<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"

<p  > Man
exercises his power against Being through the powers which Being ordains for
him.� Unlike the essents of the earth and sea, man does not capture and
subjugate these existential capacities.� Rather, Being imposes these creative
powers upon man, subjecting him to its dominion.� �The violence of poetic
speech, of thinking projection, of building configuration, of the action that
creates states is not a function of the faculties that man has, but a taming
and ordering of powers by virtue of which the essent opens up as such when man
moves into it.�<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span

In this statement, Heidegger raises the political activity of establishing a
new, revolutionary regime to the same ontological status as the most
fundamental existentials of Dasein�s Being.� He explains how these existentials
relate man to Being.� �It is this breaking out and breaking up, capturing and
subjugating that opens up the essent <i>as</i> sea, <i>as </i>earth, <i>as</i>
animal� It happens only insofar as the powers of language, of understanding,
and of building are themselves mastered in violence.�<a href="#_ftn24"

Man discloses essents through the way he violently dominates them.� However, in
order to open up these essents in their Being, he must first open himself up to
the powers of Being; he must transform himself into the opening for Being.� Man
does not achieves his mastery by lording over the powers of Being, but rather
by taming them, opening himself up to Being so that he can employ the powers of
Being to promote his own violence.� Dasein�s struggle against Being bring his
existential capacities to their full unconcealment.� Similarly, this battle
does not reduce Being�s power, but rather manifests it in its proper light by
gathering it together into its definitive limit and form.� By contending with
Being, man accepts his destined role as the governor of Being, administering
its overpowering power.</p>


<p  > Heidegger�s
uses language and knowledge as the two primary exemplars to illustrate how
these existential capacities both overpower man and give him power.� He
explains that language is not a system invented by man, but rather something
which �reigns within him as the power which he, as the essent he himself is,
must take upon himself.�<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span

Being�s overpowering power dominates man by articulating the power of language
in man, through man, and as man.� Being asserts its power through man�s
creative usage of language.� �Use of power in language in understanding, and
building helps to create (i.e.. always, to bring forth) the violent act of
laying out paths into the environing power of the essent.�<a href="#_ftn26"

using the power which Being has ordained for him, man determines the limits and
forms of essents.� As in <u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger seems to describe
language as having a visual rather than communicative function.<a href="#_ftn27"

After quoting Parmenides, one of the Greeks who inaugurated the great beginning
of philosophy, he explains, �What is said here from within the heart of Being
consists of <i>semata</i>, not signs of Being, not predicates, but indications
which in looking-toward Being from within Being indicate Being.� For in thus
looking towards-Being, we must, in an active sense, look away from all
coming-into-Being and passing-away, etc.; in the act of seeing we must hold
them away, expel them.�<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[28]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger�s analysis of Parmenides� language attempts to overturn the
representational conception of language.� Such theories perpetuate an
essentialist metaphysics by separating words from content and subjects from
predicates.� In response, Heidegger contends that language neither symbolizes
the presence of Being nor represents the qualities of the subject Being.�
Language articulates itself through a Dasein situated in Being, directing it
towards Being, and opening it up to Being.� By emphasizing the dynamic of
looking towards and looking away, Heidegger seems to echo <u>Being and Time</u>�s
argument that language determines a specific visual orientation for Being and
Dasein.� Similarly, Heidegger asserts, �In a certain broad sense the Greeks
looked upon language from a visual point of view, that is, starting from the
written language� It is in writing that the spoken language comes to stand.�
Language is, i.e. it stands in the written image of the word. ... But through
the flow of speech, language seeps away into the impermanent.�� In this
statement, Heidegger illuminates the temporal aspect of speech.� He seems to
emphasize the visual dimension of language because it preserves Being in its
proper forms and limits.� Heidegger continues, �But the Greeks also knew of the
phonetic character of language, the phone (<span >fone</span>).
... The crucial view of language remains the grammatical view.�<a href="#_ftn29"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[29]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
In this statement, Heidegger privileges the visual aspect of language over the
acoustic, over the sound-medium through which speakers communicate with one
another.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

</p>


<p  > Although
language orients Dasein towards Being, Heidegger warns that public
communication can lead it away from Being.� He states, �Where language speaks
as violent gathering, as a curbing of the overpowering, and as a safeguarding,
then and then alone will there necessarily be a breaking of bonds and loss. �Consequently,
language, speech, is at the same time idle talk.�<a href="#_ftn31"

Heidegger warns that Dasein�s usage of language necessarily leads to disaster.�
However, for Heidegger, the term �disaster� does not connote something bad.�
The �disaster� of Being and Dasein�s �safeguarding� can manifest Being in
either unconcealment or concealment.� Dasein gathers Being together in its
proper form and limits by breaking away from conventional understanding,
thereby preserving it from misinterpretation. However, this preservation can
transform into a desire for security which disastrously loses Dasein in the
complacent interpretations of the public realm.� Therefore, Heidegger warns
that the language which gathers Being together into its limit does so as the
public language of das Man, �a concealment rather than disclosure of Being,
dispersion, disorder, and mischief rather than a gathering into structure and
order.�<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[32]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger�s statement that language leads to �dispersion� seems to correlate
the public dissemination of words with Being�s deterioration and with Dasein�s
distraction from Being.� He seems to suggest that establishing structure and
order might remedy this ontological situation.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger
argues that most people consider the term �Being� as an empty word rather than
as something which brings Being to presence because public culture has
thoroughly corrupted all language.� He asserts,� �that the language in general
is worn out and used up � an indispensable but masterless means of
communication that may be used as one pleases, as indifferent as a means of
public transport, as a street car which everyone uses.�� Everyone speaks and
writes away in the language, without hindrance and above all <i>without danger</i>.�<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[33]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger argues that democratic culture has perverted language by making it
easily accessible to everyone.� He seems to suggest that this complacency can
be overcome if the public reinstitutes the virtue of mastery, supporting
masterful leaders who will take heroic risks in order to illuminate Being through
language.� Similarly, Heidegger explains, �Mere hearing scatters and diffuses
itself in what is commonly believed and said, in hearsay, in <i>doxa</i>,
appearance.� ...� We can truly hear only if we are followers.� ...� The man who
is no follower is removed and excluded from the <i>logos</i> from the start,
regardless of whether he has heard with his ears or not yet heard.�<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[34]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Not only does idle talk arise from man�s misuse of language, the public�s
chatter scatters because man does not respond to language appropriately.� Just
as Heidegger recommends the virtue of mastery, he seems to assert that, rather
than being an undifferentiated member of a democratic society of equals, man
must distinguish himself as an authentic follower.� </p>


<p  > As
with language, knowledge relates man�s power to the overpowering Being.� For
Heidegger, knowledge does not connote a simple mastery which enables man to
calculate and dominate the entities around him.� Rather, as the understanding
of apprehension, knowing requires that man open himself up to the mastery of
Being. Heidegger explains that Being posits Dasein as the site in which it
discloses itself.� �Being dominates, but because and insofar as it dominates
and appears, appearing and <i>with</i> it apprehension must <i>also</i> occur.
... The particularity of Being-human will grow from the particularity of its
belonging to Being as dominant appearing.� And since apprehension � accepting
apprehension of what shows itself � belongs to such appearing, it may be
presumed that this is precisely what determines the essence of Being-human�<a
href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[35]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger describes man�s existence as a function of the self-assertive
development of Being.� In its process of self-manifestation, Being [Sein]
requires the There [Da] of Dasein as the space in which to manifest itself.�
Heidegger therefore explains Dasein�s responsive apprehension to Being as
something which is determined by and as the dominion of Being itself.� Being
establishes its There by subjecting Dasein to its becoming, positing Dasein as
the breach for its temporal explosion, uprooting Dasein from its security and
shattering its complacency.� However, Heidegger does not consider Dasein�s
response to the incursion of Being to be a pure passivity.� �To apprehend in
this twofold sense means to let something come to one, not merely accepting,
however, but taking a receptive attitude toward that which shows itself.� When
troops prepare to receive the enemy, it is in the hope of stopping him at the
very least, of bringing him to stand.� This receptive bringing-to-stand is meant
by noiein [<span >noiein</span>.]�<a href="#_ftn36"

><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[36]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� As
before, Heidegger describes his ontological reflections using military
metaphors, raising combat to a spiritual level.� Dasein does not allow
overpowering Being to massacre it, but rather prepares for it in a strategic
defense formation.� Apprehension thereby transforms the subjection imposed by
Being into a power, allowing Dasein to take over its thrownness in its
self-projection.� Just as Being struggles against Dasein as the overpowering
dike, knowledge develops as the power of man�s techne �the basic trait of
deinon, the violent; for violence is the use of power against the
overpowering.�<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[37]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Heidegger perpetuates the militaristic intonations of his language by
correlating knowledge with strength.� He states �What has the higher rank is
the stronger.� Therefore, Being, the logos as gathering and harmony, is not
easily accessible and not accessible to all in the same form. ... The true is
not for every man, but only for the strong.�<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[38]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
As before, Heidegger inscribes an aristocratic notion of rank into the
ontological structure of Being.� In an extreme display of anti-democratic
sentiment, Heidegger argues that knowledge can not be equally accessed by
everyone.� He insists that the masses are like dogs and donkeys, feeding off easy
solutions, incapable of genuine understanding.� Understanding only manifests
itself to the strong man, the creative man who oversteps the constraints of
everyday tranquillity, of a complacent peace, and dares to engage in combat.� </p>


<p  > Man
achieves the limit of his full openness to Being when his apprehension
manifests itself as a questioning attitude.� Heidegger describes this attitude
as the �will to know.� He who wills, he who puts his whole existence into a
will, is resolved ... To know is accordingly, the ability to stand in the
manifestness of the essent, to endure it.�<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[39]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Heidegger drafts the language of <u>Being and Time</u> into
a voluntarist ethos.� Following Nietzsche, he understands knowledge as a <i>will</i>
to truth rather than as a disinterested search for facts.� For Heidegger, the
most authentic knowledge arises when Dasein understands knowing as
self-assertion.� This self assertion enables Dasein to stand heroically against
the assault of the overpowering.� Because Being occurs as a temporal process,
each moment both creates and shatters the forms and limits of Being.� Dasein�s
Being constantly shatters against the possibility of death.� Being�s dynamic
unfolds as a constant revolution, disrupting every point of stability as soon
as it is founded.� Therefore, questioning Dasein authentically confronts the
assault of Being once it braves the possibility of nonbeing.� Heidegger states,
�This essent, through questioning, is held out into the possibility of
nonbeing.� Thereby the why takes on a very different power of penetration.�<a
href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[40]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Similarly, he states, �To press inquiry into Being explicitly to the limits of
nothingness, to draw nothingness into the question of Being �� this is the
first and only fruitful step toward a true transcending of nihilism�<a
href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[41]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Dasein�s heroic confrontation with nothingness brings itself to authenticity
and Being to unconcealment.� In contrast, the fearful public sphere conceals
Being and disperses Dasein by refusing to contend with these negations.�
Nihilism occurs when this public focuses on the essent at the expense of Being,
attempting to ignore the shadow of nothingness which underlies each temporal
appearance.� </p>


<p  > The
proper apprehension of Being requires that Dasein struggle to disclose the
proper visual appearance of Being.� Heidegger locates the historical origin of
this struggle in Greek thought and art.� �[The Greeks] were perpetually
compelled to wrest Being from appearance and preserve it against appearance ...
The great age of Greece was a single creative self-assertion amid the confused,
intricate struggle between the powers of Being and appearance.�<a href="#_ftn42"
name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[42]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger explains that those who inaugurated <i>the</i> great beginning of
philosophy, the Greeks, strove for the appropriate visual disclosure of Being.�
Before the advent of Plato, Greek thinkers did not denigrate manifestation as a
�mere appearance� of transcendental principles.� Instead, they attended to the
essential ambiguity of appearance, to the manner in which it both discloses and
conceals Being.� Being occurs as a process of self-blossoming manifestation in
the momentary appearances which limit it and shape it.� By disclosing itself in
this manner, this process of appearing risks being mistaken for a set of
permanent substances which underlie these appearances.�� The Greeks responded
to this ontological situation by disclosing the Being which concealed itself as
appearances and by protecting Being against this concealment.� Heidegger
describes this Greek effort as a power, as the creative self-assertion which
imposes limits and establishes forms.� He continues, �Logos here stands in
closest connection with krinein [<span >krinein</span>,]
to separate in the sense of de-cide, in collecting toward the collectedness of
Being.� Selection is the foundation and proof of the pursuit of Being and the
battle against appearance, to set a measure that will determine rank.�<a
href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[43]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
this statement Heidegger correlates the artistic production of works with a
determination of the military virtue of rank.� He continues, �To be a man means
to take gathering upon oneself, to undertake a gathering apprehension of the
Being of the essent, the sapient incorporation of appearing in the work, and so
to administer unconcealment, to preserve it against cloaking and concealment.� <a
href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[44]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Dasein gathers Being together into its proper limits by resolutely choosing a
possibility which will manifest the greatness of Dasein and Being.�� Creative
Dasein authentically apprehends Being by administering its appearance, as if by
divine decree.� </p>


<p  > Dasein
seizes upon this creative mode of apprehension by refusing the complacent,
public mode of disclosure.� Explaining that authentic Dasein must decide for
Being, against nothingness, and must struggle with appearance, Heidegger
argues, �But such essential decision must use violence if it is to preserve
against the continuous pressure of involvement in the everyday and
commonplace.� The violence of this decisive departure along the path to the
Being of the essent wrests man out of his home in what happens to be nearest
and most familiar to him.�<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[45]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Heidegger seems to equate the everyday world of the public
with nonbeing, or at least with the concealment of Being in its appearance.�
During the process of its appearing, Being discloses aspects which can
potentially be viewed by anyone.� Public interpretations conceal Being by
fixing these momentary aspects as the very essence of Being.� Dasein must
overcome these public distortions by wrenching himself out of this public
complacency, daring to posit Being anew as a creative work.� Not only does this
heroic venture disclose Being in its unconcealment, it manifests Dasein in its
authenticity.� �It is logos as ingathering, as man�s collecting himself toward
fitness that first brings Being-human into its essence, so thrusting it into
homelessness, insofar as the home is dominated by the appearance of the
ordinary, customary, and commonplace.�<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"

</p>

<p  >�</p>

<p  > Heidegger
argues that man falls away from Being and from his own Dasein when he tires of
this struggle and seeks complacent security.� He describes this refusal of
conflict as man�s most drastic and most violent negation of Being.� �Time and
time again the violent ones must shrink back in fear from this use of force and
yet they are unable to forego it.� Amid this reluctant will to mastery, the
suspicion is bound to flare up at times that perhaps the overpowering will be
most securely and completely dominated if the concealment of Being � the
emerging power, whose essence is logos, the collectedness of the conflicting �
is simply preserved, if in a certain sense every possibility of appearing, of
manifestation, is denied.�<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[47]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
According to this analysis, Dasein�s struggle against the overpowering is
threatened by the possibility that Dasein, exhausted by the fight, might give
up the battle.� Dasein might shrink back in fear, being unable to stand in the
light of Being, unable to withstand the dread it feels confronting the terror
of Being�s negativity.� This shrinking back exists as a potential within all of
Dasein�s self-assertions.� Dasein violently gathers together Being by
poetically breaking away from its familiar surroundings and creating a new,
revolutionary order in the world.� Dasein�s creation of a certain stability
opens up the possibility that it might settle down in that order rather than
maintaining a perpetual struggle to overcome the situation which it has created
for itself.� Instead of maintaining the tension, the potency, and the dread of
his existential situation, man might retreat into cowardly complacency.��
Through this refusal of struggle, man does not renounce violence, but rather
commits the most terrible violence against Being and against himself.� By
avoiding struggle, Dasein shuts itself off from the unconcealment of Being,
refusing to open itself up as the site for Being�s disclosure.� Dasein thereby
prevents itself from asserting its creative power, its possibilities, in the
world, affirming itself as the negation of Dasein, not-Dasein.� Just as
Nietzsche argued that man vivisected its own animal instincts when it was
�finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace,�<a href="#_ftn48"

impotent retreat from the struggle with Being correlates with a perversion of
his understanding.� Heidegger explains, �Man�s Dasein changes accordingly.� The
slow end of this history, the slow end in which we have long been standing, is
the domination of thinking as <i>ratio</i> (in the sense of understanding as
well as reasoning) over the <i>Being</i> of the essent.�<a href="#_ftn50"

position:relative;top:0pt'>[50]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
When man denies himself the strength to take the great risk of battling with
Being itself, his thinking asserts its dominion over the Being of essents.� In
effect, he transforms from a hero into a petty tyrant, into a demagogue,
lording his rule over a multiplicity which he can easily conquer.� Man does so
by reinterpreting spirit as intelligence.� He thereby asserts his intelligence
through the cleverness<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[51]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�of
scientific calculation, organizing essents into determinable categories.�
Heidegger argues that this interpretation transforms spirit into a manipulable
tool, causes knowledge to be classified into compartmentalized sciences, and
ultimately converts spirit into a cultural ornament.� Once the spiritual
activity of understanding one�s existence becomes so degraded, people adopt the
attitude that �it suffices to know the essent and to secure our mastery over
it.�<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[52]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger�s repeated condemnations of security seem to be directed against
modern philosophy, especially against Cartesian epistemology.� In his <u>Meditations
on First Philosophy</u>, Descartes quests for a secure foundation for certain
knowledge.� Contemplating the insecurity of the sensory knowledge of external
appearances, Descartes posits a certain foundation within and as his own
subjectivity.� The modern knower thereby achieves his mastery over the world by
converting Being into a set of objects.� He perceives essents as actual things
rather than as dynamic possibilities which Dasein and Being continuously change
in their struggle.� Rather than affirming his nature as the open site for this
conflict, the Cartesian subject ignores the temporal process of Being,
stabilizing things as quiddities, as abstract and eternal essences.�� </p>


<p  > According
to Heidegger, this perversion of understanding began with Plato who, unable to
maintain the greatness of the Greek beginning, posited Being as idea (<span
>idea</span>.)� Plato�s philosophy begins a period of
decline when the space for Being�s unconcealment � presumably Dasein as the
site of disclosure � collapses.� For the Greeks, the term idea referred to the
aspect which Being�s appearing discloses to man�s vision.� By interpreting
Being as idea, Dasein separates itself from Being by interpreting itself as an
observer of Being rather than a participant in the struggle with Being.� �Where
the struggle ceases, the essent does not vanish, but the world turns away.� The
essent is no longer asserted (i.e. preserved as such.)� ... The original
emergence and standing of energies, the phainesthai [<span style='font-family:
Symbol'>fainesqai</span>,] or appearance in the great sense of a
world-epiphany, becomes a visibility of things that are already made and can be
pointed out.� The eye, the vision, which originally projected the project into
potency, becomes a mere looking at or looking over or gaping at.� Vision has
degenerated into mere optics.�<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[53]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Explicitly associating <u>Being and Time</u>�s references to projection with
his language of power, Heidegger explains that an authentic manifestation of
Being requires Dasein�s constant engagement in its struggle with Being.� When
man stops asserting himself, he perverts his vision and Being�s unconcealment.�
Dasein�s visual disengagement from the world, his objectification of it, indicates
his fundamental impotence.� Man�s impotence asserts itself as a power through
the paralysis of the power of Being.�� �Appearing in the first and authentic
sense as bringing-itself-to-stand in togetherness involves space, which it
first conquers.�<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[54]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Being
manifests itself in appearing by dynamically exerting its dominion, by creating
a space for itself, by creating itself as space.� Whereas appearance emerges as
the temporal process of Being�s appearing, man looks at frozen, momentary
appearances as if they subsisted permanently by themselves.� Heidegger argues
that man refers appearances back to his own visual perspective rather than
Being once he traps himself in the complacency of familiar, public existence.�
Heidegger contends, �Appearing in the second sense emerges from an already
finished space ... Now vision becomes decisive, instead of the thing itself.�<a
href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[55]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
positing space as something substantive and permanent, man denies the rule of
Being, grasping essents as objects within his personal sphere.� </p>


<p  > <u>Introduction
to Metaphysics</u> orients Heidegger�s philosophical reflections on this
decline of spiritual power and truth towards a political refashioning of the
public sphere.� Heidegger argues that the metaphysical corruption inaugurated
by Platonic philosophy has consummated itself in the thought and life of modern
Western culture.� Heidegger warns his German students and readers that �We are
caught in a pincers.� Situated in the center, our nation incurs the severest
pressure.�� It is the nation with the most neighbors and hence the most
endangered.� With this, it is the most metaphysical of nations.�� In this
statement, Heidegger applies his insights into the nature of Being and Dasein
to the political situation of Germany.� Just as Dasein opened itself up as the
space for Being�s disclosure, Germany, in the center of Europe, exposes itself
as the site for the metaphysical struggle over the historical destiny of
Being.� This metaphor of pincers seems to allude to his description of the
de-cision of Dasein.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[56]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The disastrous decline of spirit forces Germany to choose whether it will let
these nihilistic pincers crush it into submission or whether it will confront
these negations, fight for the unconcealment of Being, and affirm the
authenticity of itself.� Heidegger insists that the German nation will either
submit to the �darkening of the world,�<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[57]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�the
disempowerment of the spirit, or will begin a new beginning �more radically,
with all the strangeness, darkness, insecurity that attend a true beginning.�<a
href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[58]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger explains that America and Russia exert the pressure which presents Germany
with the possibility of submission or triumph.� �In America and Russia [the
deterioration of spirit into intelligence] grew into a boundless etcetera of
indifference and always-the-sameness � so much so that the quantity took on a
quality of its own.� Since then the domination in those countries of a cross
section of the indifferent mass has become something more than a dreary
accident.� It has become an active onslaught that destroys all rank and every
world-creating impulse of the spirit, and calls it a lie.� This is the
onslaught of what we call the demonic (in the sense of destructive evil.)�<a
href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[59]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
this statement, Heidegger encourages an already militaristic Germany to
confront this spiritual threat by literally demonizing its opponents.� Echoing
Nietzsche�s critique of the mob-instinct which animates democracy and
communism, Heidegger applies his critique of das Man to Germany�s military
enemies, America and Russia.� Heidegger takes the global dominance of these
countries as a sign that mass culture and the analytical sciences which it
perpetuates threatens to eradicate the genuine spiritual culture and
philosophical reflection of Germany.� He inscribes this cultural transformation
in a tragic plot.� This massification of man will destroy genuine greatness,
genuine expressions of creative power, preventing Dasein from daring to do
anything exceptional, wrenching it back down to the realm of the commonplace,
the familiar.� </p>


<p  > Heidegger�s
perception of this spiritual decline causes him to commit himself to the
politics of National Socialism.� In saying this however, one must understand
what the political signifies for Heidegger.� Heidegger claimed that he had only
committed himself to a �private National Socialism� which did not necessarily
correlate with the one which actually unfolded itself in German history.�
However, this statement does not imply that Heidegger�s commitments lay at an
individual level rather than a socio-political one.� Many commentators have
wondered how the author of the individualistic philosophy of <u>Being and Time</u>
could have committed himself to the demagoguery of Nazism.� For example, Jurgen
Habermas� reflects upon his reaction to Heidegger�s political commitment,
saying �Heidegger had treated the whole framework of <u>Being and Time</u>
without any obvious change up to 1933.� Then he suddenly gave it a collectivist
turn:� Dasein was no longer this poor Kierkegaardian-Sartrean individual
hanging in the air, in <i>Sorge</i> [Care.]� But now Dasein was the Dasein of
the people, of the <i>Volk</i>.�<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[60]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Even though much of Heidegger�s <u>Being and Time</u> evokes an individualist
reading, Heidegger never <i>identifies</i> Dasein as an individual human being,
but rather as the historical location where Being discloses itself.� In his
speeches of 1930s, Heidegger posits Germany as the corporate Dasein which has
opened itself up most profoundly to the unconcealment of Being.�� Urging the
German populace to support Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State by
voting to withdraw Germany from the League of Nations, Heidegger proclaims,
�[The F�hrer] is giving the people the possibility of making, directly, the
highest free decision of all:� whether the entire people wants its own Dasein
or whether it does <i>not </i>want it.�<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[61]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Similarly, in <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>, Heidegger demonstrates his
hopes for its fascist government by figuring the public arena of the polis as
the site of historical struggle.� He states� �Polis [<span style='font-family:
Symbol'>poliV</span>] means the place, the there, wherein and as which
historical Dasein is.� The polis is the historical place, the there <i>in </i>which,<i>
out of </i>which, and<i> for </i>which history happens ... [This place] is
political, i.e. at the site of history, provided there be (for example) poets <i>alone</i>,
but then really poets, priests <i>alone</i>, but then really priests, rulers <i>alone</i>,
but then really rulers.�<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[62]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Heidegger elevates the political arena to an ontological
level, defining it as the place, the There, where the spiritual-ontological destiny
of Being itself is decided historically.� By taking this decision upon
themselves, the three political leaders, the poet, priest, and ruler,
heroically establish an authentic public space for Being�s unconcealment.�
Heidegger continues, �<i>Be</i>, but this means as violent men to use power, to
become preeminent.�<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[63]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
By putting the word �Be� in italics, this statement ontologically supports the
political model of an authoritarian F�hrer who rules through violence, forging
the fate of the German nation.�� </p>


<p  > In
committing himself to this notion of a national Dasein ruled by an
authoritarian F�hrer, Heidegger maintains his critique of the unthinking mass
sensibility of das Man, the consciousness which dominates bureaucratic
countries such as America and Russia, which manifests itself as positivism and
communism, and which threatens to conquer the globe.� By pledging himself to a
�private National Socialism,� Heidegger seems to indicate his disdain for the
demagogic aspects of Nazism, the ways in which it pandered to the shallow
desires and aspirations of the German public.� Rather than attempting to
satisfy the demands of the masses, Germany�s authentic political leaders must
tear themselves away from the security of their customary lives.� �Pre-eminent
in the historical place, they become at the same time <i>apolis</i> [<span
>apoliV</span>,] without city and place, lonely,
strange, and alien, without issue amid the essent as a whole, and at the same
time without statute and limit, without structure and order, because they
themselves <i>as</i> creators must first create all this.�<a href="#_ftn64"
name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[64]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
According to Heidegger�s ontological analysis, the authentic, fascist ruler
needs neither law nor public consensus to establish his tyrannical rule.� As an
original creator, he takes upon himself the responsibility and the risk of
establishing a new, revolutionary regime.</p>


<p  > Just
as Heidegger advocates for an authoritarian ruler, a F�hrer, the German title
of the <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u>, <i>Einf�hrung in die Metaphysik</i>,
implies that he himself will assume the parallel role of the priest who leads
[f�hrung] the German people into (ein) their metaphysical destiny.<a
href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[65]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� He
argues that the German nation as a whole must, through struggle, rise to lead Europe
out of its decline.� By taking a creative view of its tradition, Germany must
unleash the spiritual power of its repeatable historical possibilities.��
Heidegger explains, �Spirit is the mobilization of the powers of the essent as
such and as a whole.� It is indispensable if the peril of world darkening is to
be forestalled and if our nation in the center of the Western world is to take
on its historical mission.�<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[66]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger undoubtedly uses the term �mobilization� as a deliberate allusion to
Ernst J�nger�s essay Total Mobilization, a text which heavily influenced his thinking
during the 1930s.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[67]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Like Heidegger, J�nger warns that mass movements of both the left and the right
are putting the German �dream of freedom� under a �pincers� iron grasp.�<a
href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[68]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� To
remedy this, J�nger recommends that Germany should mobilize all of its
resources towards war so that it can effect the �mobilization of the German,�
so that each German man can encounter himself as a stronger force, so that he
can realize himself in the midst of the battlefield.<a href="#_ftn69"

<p  > Although
Heidegger consciously evokes the martial spirit of Nietzsche and J�nger, he
tries to distinguish his ontological thinking from the theories of Nazi
propagandists.� Supporting the fascist campaign against intellectualism, he
warns that, by simply opposing it, Nazi ideologues might reproduce a similarly
lifeless body of thought.�� He states, �They may not be intellectualists but
they come from the same source.�� This spiritual conservatism, stemming partly
from natural inertia and partly from conscious effort, has become the feeding
ground of political reaction.�� The misinterpretation of thought and the abuse
to which it leads can be overcome only by an authentic thinking that goes back
to the roots � and <i>by nothing else</i>.�� Heidegger seems to direct this
critique of quasi-intellectualism against philosophers of race such as Alfred
Rosenberg.<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[70]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
�The spirit falsified into intelligence falls to the level of a tool in the
service of others� ... whether it is applied to the organization and regulation
of a nation�s vital resources and race � in any case the spirit as intelligence
becomes the impotent superstructure of something else.� <a href="#_ftn71"

><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[71]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Heidegger contends that, like American positivism and Russian Marxism, Nazi
racism disempowers spirit by misinterpreting it as a technological implement.�
He states at the end of his lecture, �The works that are being peddled about
nowadays as the philosophy of National Socialism have nothing whatever to do
with the inner truth and greatness of this movement (namely the encounter
between global technology and modern man) � have all been written by men
fishing in the troubled waters of �values� and �totalities.��<a href="#_ftn72"

This conclusion of <u>Introduction to Metaphysics</u> seems to reflect
Heidegger�s personal conclusion that only a philosophy as radical and
revolutionary as his own could satisfy the spiritual needs of a movement as
radical and revolutionary as Nazism.� </p>

>�It would be interesting to apply Hegel�s analysis of
how absolute freedom transforms into absolute terror to Heidegger�s description
of Being and Dasein as the deinon.� According to Hegel, Absolute Terror occurs
after the spirit has been objectified into Utility and before it has been
transformed into morality.� Perhaps one could apply this Hegelian juxtaposition
to situate Heidegger between utilitarian science and Levinas� ethics.�
Furthermore, one could parallel this discussion with a comparison of how the
Reign of Terror and Nazism consummate the epoch of reason and of modernity. [<u>The
Phenomenology of Mind</u>, p. 599 -610]</span></p>

>However, Heidegger states, �for to be a man is to
speak.� man says yes and no only because in his profound essence he is a
speaker, <i>the </i>speaker.� That is his distinction and at the same time his
burden .... Even if we had a thousand eyes and a thousand ears, if our essence
did not include the power of language, all essents would be closed to us, the
essent that we ourselves are no less than the essent that we are not.� (p. 82)�
Although this statement sounds like it depreciates vision in comparison to
speaking, I would argue that Heidegger intends to point towards the
relationship which obtains between language and vision.� Comparing language to
ears makes sense because ears respond to linguistic input, but how does
language relate to the eyes?� Heidegger states, �True hearing has nothing to do
with ear and mouth, but means:� to follow the <i>logos </i>and what it is,
namely the collectedness of the collectedness of the essent itself.� (p. 129)
Here, Heidegger seems to emphasize that hearing� does not orient a subject who
hears to a heard object through the medium of a sensory organ, but rather is a
process where Dasein opens to Being, letting it work through him.� Perhaps
Heidegger�s depreciation of the thousand eyes intends to condemn the same
sensory model of experience.� Perhaps Heidegger is trying to assert that,
whereas we assume our own viewpoint, Being works through us in speech. </span></p>

>� With Hitler as the ruler, Heidegger as the priest,
the poet would, of course, have to be H�lderlin.� Throughout his career, but
especially during the war, Heidegger used H�lderlin�s poetry and thought to
meditate on the destiny of the German nation.� He wrote the essay �Wie wenn am
Feiertage...� as a preface to the volume of H�lderlin�s poetry which many
German soldiers read in the trenches.� For a recent discussion of the political
implications of Heidegger�s readings of H�lderlin and Trakl, see Veronique
Foti�s�� <u>Heidegger and the Poets:� Poesis, Sophia, Techne</u>. [Princeton,
New Jersey:� Humanities Press International, 1992.]� It would be interesting to
read Plato�s condemnation of poetry against Heidegger�s usage of it.� In <u>The
Republic</u>, Socrates gives two reasons for excluding poets from the
Republic.� In Book 8, he explains, �And therefore, I said, the tragic poets
being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we
do not receive them into our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.�
In Book 10, Socrates argues that poetry is merely a mimetic representation of
objects which themselves represent the ideas.� He states that poets distance
men from the truth so much that they cause men to have an uneven temperament
rather than to maintain a rational equanimity and to focus on pleasure and pain
rather than on justice.� What is the relationship between these two separate
reasons?� Is Heidegger�s condemnation of mimetic representation correlated with
his commitment to Nazism?� How are these two factors connected to Heidegger�s
reappraisal of affectivity?� One would start asking these questions through a
close reading of Heidegger�s 1936-37 lecture course, <u>Nietzsche:� The Will to
Power as Art</u>, in which he critiques <u>The Republic</u>�s analysis of
mimesis for its separation of the sensuous and supersensuous.� This course also
emphasizes the importance of the will to power expressed in affective states
like <i>Rausch</i> [�rapture.�] One should also look at <i>Platons Lehre von
der Wahrheit</i>.</span></p>

Early Works</span></b></a></p>



<p  ><a name=Reflections><b><span
>A. &quot;Reflections on the
Philosophy of Hitlerism&quot; (1934)</span></b></a></p>



<p  > To understand fully
Levinas� metaphorical usage of power and light, one must trace the development
of these motifs throughout his work.� As John Llywelyn has aptly noted, Levinas�
ideas develop genealogically.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
His texts reappropriate and reconfigure ideas introduced in previous essays,
condensing sustained analyses into succinct formulae and magnifying details
into central components of his intellectual framework.� It is therefore useful
to walk through his corpus to trace the development of certain key elements
which can be overlooked in the conceptual architecture of later writings.� In
one of his very first essays, &quot;Reflections on the Philosophy of
Hitlerism,&quot; Levinas generates certain themes which he readopts in later
works.� Written in 1934 shortly after Hitler came to power, this essay seems
especially important for understanding the urgency of a thinker whose biography
&quot;is dominated by the presentiment and the memory of the Nazi horror.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><i><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
color:blue'>[2]</span></b></span></span></i></span></a>� </p>


<p  > Although one must
consider how the ghosts of World War II haunt his work, raising the specter of
Nazism and of Nazi violence in a discussion of Heidegger and Levinas requires
some preliminary remarks.� After enduring so many works which have desired only
to &quot;prove&quot; that Heidegger was a Nazi or which have simply attacked
him <i>ad hominem</i> for being a Nazi, one must resist the temptation of
opposing Heidegger-the-German-fascist against
Levinas-the-French-Jew-who-survived-the-Holocaust.� The polemical force of each
characterization overwhelms the corpus of each writer�s life and thought, telling
us too much and too little about both.� Worse still, both labels pretend to
understand what constitutes the essence of &quot;the Holocaust&quot; and of
&quot;Nazism.&quot;� In his philosophical works, Levinas rarely refers
explicitly to the events of 1933-1945 and avoids naming it as
&quot;Auschwitz&quot; or &quot;the Holocaust.&quot;<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a><sup>�
</sup>For him, attaching a name to this horror would reduce the incomparability
of human suffering to a quiddity, a describable thing, casting the agony that
was expressed in a Saying into something which can be easily stated in a Said.�
Similarly, simply calling Heidegger &quot;a Nazi&quot; or affecting an
understanding of the essence of &quot;Nazism&quot; would be presuming that
Nazism was merely a historical phenomenon with a specific set of spatial and
temporal co-ordinates.� By positing a locus for &quot;Nazism,&quot; such
descriptions attempt to make it someone else�s problem, a German problem,
ignoring what is most disturbing about it: certain forces which animate modern
culture and subjectivity already contain Nazism as a possibility. </p>


<a name="Reflections"><p  > &quot;Reflections on
the Philosophy of Hitlerism&quot; [RPH] warns that fascism does not merely
represent an aberration, but rather indicates a certain primordial violence
within the soul of modern man<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span ><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span >[4]</span></span></span></span></a>
and the modern state.� He states, &quot;Hitlerism is more than a contagion or a
madness; it is an awakening of elementary feelings. ... These elementary
feelings harbor a philosophy.� They express a soul�s principal attitude towards
the whole of reality and its own destiny. ... It questions the very principles
of a civilization.&quot;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[5]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas explains that, as a possibility of modern culture, National Socialism
attempts to destroy liberal society by embracing elementary powers that belie
its superficiality.� Therefore, fascists urge men to obey the primordial call
of their heritage in order to become authentic.� </p>


<p  > Levinas asserts that
the legacy of the past affects man as a &quot;feeling of natural
powerlessness.&quot;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[6]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This description seems to echo Heidegger's analyses of thrownness (<i>Geworfenheit)</i>
and historicity as ways that one is submissive to the temporality of the
past.&nbsp; When swept up by the flow of history, man experiences his
initiatives as being the mere continuations of previous events.� Because they
experience the course of time as being inevitable and inescapable, individuals
feel shackled to its laws, incapable of creating their own unique destinies.�
According to Levinas, the chains of heritage imprison the human soul in a
situation forever beyond the reach of its power, determining its unchosen
responsibilities, and propelling it towards an unchosen fate.��� </p>


<p  > By using terms such as
&quot;enchainment&quot; to describe the &quot;weight&quot; of past, Levinas
deliberately correlates historicality with materiality.� In a classically
metaphysical manner, he confronts this physical problem with a set of spiritual
solutions. Judaism reconciles itself with the past through a paradoxical state
of passivity, remorse.� &quot;Remorse - the painful expression of a radical
powerlessness to redeem the irreparable - heralds the repentance that generates
the pardon that redeems.&quot;<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[7]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Rather than wrestling against the chain of past events, the Jew liberates the
past by confessing to his human weakness, his susceptibility to pain.<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
this analysis, Levinas subverts the fascist adoration of power by describing
remorse as a radical powerlessness.� For Levinas, Judaism constitutes a
religion that already questions the virile self-assertion of subjectivity; that
already acknowledges its dependence on an outside source of forgiveness.�� This
state of passivity gives the Jew the paradoxical and holy freedom to bear the
weight of the past humbly and to acquire redemption through this very humility </p>


<p  > Levinas traces a genealogical
development of spiritual releases from historical incumbency that descend from
Jewish remorse.� Rather than explaining Christianity as the Hegelian synthesis
of the two cultures, Levinas deliberately affiliates the Christian worldview
with the Jewish and distinguishes it from the Greek.� &quot;The burning feeling
of natural powerlessness that man experiences in the face of time is what
creates the whole tragedy of the Greek <i>Moira</i>, the whole acuteness of the
idea of sin and the whole greatness of Christianity�s rebellion.� In contrast
to the Atrides, who struggle in the grip of a strange and brutal past that
afflicts them like a curse, Christianity puts forth a mystical drama.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Rather than humbling himself to his powerlessness as a Jew would, the Greek
tragic hero grapples against his fate, deriving power from the forces which
would render him powerless.�� This reference to Greek tragedy seems to allude
to the German appropriation of tragic motifs, including Heidegger's description
of <i>Dasein </i>authentically accepting its fate.� Levinas' reference to the
hero's &quot;struggle&quot; may also refer obliquely to Hitler�s manifesto <i>Mein
Kampf</i> as well as Heidegger's analysis of conflict<span style='font-family:
Symbol'> (polemoV) </span>�in Heraclitus.</p>


<p  > Levinas� reason for
drawing this distinction between Christian and German-Greek cultures seems to
be largely rhetorical.� Written for the liberal Catholic journal <i>Esprit</i>,
&quot;Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism&quot; explains that, despite
Pope Pius XII's concordat with the Hitler, Nazism still threatens Christian
culture.� By going back to the &quot;source, to intuition, to the original
decision that makes them possible&quot;<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
line-height:150%;position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>,
Levinas hopes to elucidate the logical contradiction between Christian
universalism and racist particularism.� Locating a source in remorseful Jewish
rather than tragic Greek culture will alert European, Christian countries to
the danger posed by Hitler�s regime.� </p>


<p  > Levinas explains how
Christianity develops the Judaic notion of a spiritual escape from the burden
of temporality.� According to Levinas, the Christian model of salvation enables
each Christian to choose his own destiny.� Despite the inevitable legacy of the
past, the Christian retains the supernatural possibility to extricate himself
from the contract<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[11]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�that
he has made with fate.� This freedom allows him both to overcome the finality
of the past and to recover his independence from the choices he has made.�
Notably, Levinas describes this Christian capacity for salvation as a power, in
contrast to the Judaic experience of powerless remorse. &quot;Throughout the
vicissitudes of the world�s real history, the power of renewal gives the soul a
noumenal nature that is protected from the attacks launched by a world in which
concrete man is placed.� This is only apparently a paradox.� The soul�s
detachment is not an abstract state; it is the concrete and positive power to
become detached and abstract.&quot;<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[12]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>����
In contrast to Heidegger's ideal of authentic engagement, Christianity
highlights man�s concrete power to detach himself from his concrete commitments
and to evade the imperatives of the concrete world.<a href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
>[13]</span></span></span></span></a></p>


<p  > Levinas argues that
this Christian model of individual spiritual freedom establishes a
universalist, catholic idea that all men, independent of their individual
differences, are fundamentally equal.� Modern philosophical and political
thinkers transform this Judeo-Christian<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
line-height:150%;position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[14]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�model
of freedom into the Enlightenment notion of autonomy.� By finding freedom and
sovereignty in the light of reason, liberals assert that man has an ultimate
power over the contingencies of the material world.<sup> </sup>�&quot;[Liberal
thought] creates a gulf between man and the world.� It makes it impossible to
apply the categories of the physical world to the spirituality of reason, and
so locates the ultimate foundation of the spirit outside the brutal world and
the implacable history of concrete existence.� ... The light of reason was
enough to chase away the shadows of irrationality.&quot;<a href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[15]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Against
Nietzsche and Heidegger, Levinas praises the breach that liberal thought
creates between reason and concrete existence.� Reinvoking Descartes' metaphors
of vision, Levinas explains that light establishes a medium through which the
spiritual individual can separate himself from the material realm.� The
concrete forces of destiny do not compel humanity's obedience.� Instead, reason
enables man freely to choose possibilities in the world while still remaining
detached from it.</p>


<p  > As stated above,
Levinas correlates the inevitable chains of the past with the materiality of
human existence.� For him, the body is composed of elemental forces that form
the foundation of human existence.� Even while acknowledging the primordial
essence of these material powers, European thought has always opposed the idea
that individuals are determined entirely by their physical natures.� Western
philosophy has acknowledged the feeling of identity between the self and the
body. However, it has always seen this relationship as a form of bondage which
must be overcome in order to achieve spiritual freedom.� </p>


<p  > Levinas explains that
certain physical states make one identify oneself with one�s body.� He
explains, &quot;Can we not say that analysis reveals in pain the spirit�s
opposition to this pain, a rebellion or refusal to remain within it and
consequently an attempt to go beyond it?� But is it not the case that this
attempt is characterized from the very beginning as desperate?� Does not the
rebelling spirit remain ineluctably locked within pain?� And is it not this
despair that constitutes the very foundation of pain.&quot;<a href="#_ftn16"
name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This description of the paradoxical, desperate feeling of pain echoes Levinas�
discussion of Jewish remorse as &quot;the <i>painful</i> expression of a
radical powerlessness to redeem the irreparable.&quot;<a href="#_ftn17"
name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Like remorse, pain reveals a unique position of opposition in which the spirit
confronts something over which it maintains no power.� However, this opposition
neither overcomes the suffering of materiality nor transforms materiality into
a power.� As with remorse, this absolute vulnerability constitutes the
foundation and pathos of pain.</p>


<p  > Levinas argues that, in
contrast to Western thought, Nazi ideology develops a conception of humanity
which celebrates the elementary bodily forces.� &quot;The mysterious urgings of
the blood, the appeals of heredity and the past for which the body serves as an
enigmatic vehicle, lose the character of being problems that are subject to a
solution put forward by a sovereign Self.� ... Man�s essence no longer lies in
freedom, but in a kind of bondage. ... It means becoming aware of the
ineluctable original chain that is unique to our bodies and above all accepting
this chaining.&quot;<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[18]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In denying any radical distinction between matter and spirit, German thought
defines the essence of soul as its material imprisonment.� Rather than trying
to rid themselves from the bondage which the body imposes upon the spirit, men
must authenticate themselves by acknowledging and accepting these fetters.�
According to Levinas, this adoration of material enchainment gives rise to the
racist particularism of Nazism.</p>


<p  > According to Levinas, a
new type of truth arises from the Germanic spiritualization of the body and
embodiment of the spirit.� Western thought's mind-body distinction had
effectively separated the self from the truth.� Because they always asserted
that the soul retains the power to detach itself from whatever commitments it
makes, enlightenment thinkers proclaimed that men are free to choose or to
doubt ideas.� No inevitable link connects the self and its ideas, so truth
became characterized by universality.� An idea can be detached from the person
who first proposed it and can be accepted by any other individual.� This
creates a universal community of equals who can all become masters of a true
idea.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span ><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span >[19]</span></span></span></span></a>�
However, the breach between selfhood and ideas opens up this definition of
truth to insecurity.� As Descartes recognized, the ambiguous possibility of
skepticism shadows every effort of knowing.� </p>


<p  > Against the possible
insincerity of Western truth, Germanic philosophy defines truth as
authenticity.� The German ideal locates authenticity within the powers which
constitute the human body.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
> <a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino'>[20]</span></span></a></span></span>� Unable and
unwilling to break free from these chains, the spirit identifies its truth as
this bondage.� Levinas explains, &quot;Chained to his body, man sees himself
refusing the power to escape from himself. Truth is no longer for him the
contemplation of a foreign spectacle; instead it consists in a drama in which
man is himself the actor.� It is under the weight of his whole existence, which
includes facts on which there is no going back, that man will say his yes or
his no.&quot;<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[21]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The Germanic -- fascist, Nietzschean, and Heideggerian -- notion of truth
refuses the theoretical tradition of Western thought that posits light as a
medium of separation.� Viewing such distancing as evasion, this ideal of
authenticity embraces self-assertive engagement.</p>


<p  > Fascist thinking
replaces universality with expansion as the necessary condition for truth.�
Whereas Western thought emphasizes man�s spiritual power as his capacity to
accept universal, third person truths, the German emphasis on material power
insists that one must violently seize the authentic truths which belong to
oneself.� Although Levinas does not specifically mention it, Heidegger's
definition truth as <i>Dasein</i>'s disclosure of itself rather than as
publicly verifiable statements also seems to accord with this self-assertive
epistemological model.� Force, because it is located within the body of the one
who has force, does not separate from the one who exerts it nor can it be
appropriated by those who are subjected to it.� Instead of creating a community
of equal masters, this force of truth, this truth-as-force, establishes a
unified world of forceful masters and subjugated slaves.� Just one year into
Hitler's reign, Levinas warns, &quot;Nietzsche�s will to power, which modern
Germany is rediscovering� and glorifying, is not only a new ideal; it is an
ideal that simultaneously brings with it its own form of universalization:� war

<p  > The violence which
Levinas warned against in his 1934 essay culminated in the horrors of the World
War II.� Among other atrocities, his father, his mother, his two brothers, and
many of his friends were slaughtered in concentration camps.<a href="#_ftn23"

>� </span>Whatever personal impact this
may have had, it seems to have caused Levinas to make an even more radical and
explicit philosophical break with Heidegger�s thinking.� In his first major
post-war publication, <i>Existence and Existents</i>, he states &quot;If at the
beginning our reflections are in large measure inspired by the philosophy of
Martin Heidegger, where we find the concept of ontology and of the relationship
which man sustains with Being, they are also governed by the profound need to
leave the climate of that philosophy, and by the conviction that we cannot
leave it for a philosophy that would be pre-Heideggerian.&quot;<a href="#_ftn24"

Whereas &quot;Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism&quot; indicates
criticisms of Heidegger within his general attack on German thought, Levinas�
post-war work argues against Heidegger through deliberate, directed attacks
against and subversions of key concepts and metaphors in his thinking.� For all
of its innovations, however, Levinas' post-war writing also regenerates ideas
mentioned in his previous essays. </p>


<p  ><i>Time and the
Other</i> [T&amp;O] updates the critique Levinas made in RPH against the
fascist ideology that locates a human essence in elementary material powers.�
In T&amp;O, he subverts Heidegger's model of authentic self-assertion by
freeing the subject from its entrenchment in Being and by severing its
ineluctable connection with death.��� Levinas criticizes Heidegger for figuring
the individual person as the &quot;There&quot; [<i>Da</i>] for the occurrence
of Being [<i>Sein</i>].� Levinas uses the term &quot;transitivity&quot; to
describe the relationship between Being and <i>Dasein</i>.� Being is not an
eternal, unmoving, self-subsistent substance, but rather something that is
produced by relationships articulated through its There.<a href="#_ftn25"
name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[25]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� <i>Dasein</i>
is also transitive in the way it exists through its possibilities: moving
beyond the actual facts into which it has been thrown, <i>Dasein</i>
dynamically projects its present situation into the beyond of its future
possibilities.� <i>Dasein</i> exists as the transiting of Being, a voyage that
ends with its death.� An authentic confrontation with this finitude not only
exposes <i>Dasein</i> to the limits of its being, it also discloses its very
power to project possibilities.� Only through acknowledging its possible
termination can <i>Dasein</i> transit towards the terminus of its possible
future.� </p>


<p  > Against Heidegger,
Levinas asserts that solitary existence is not transitive.� He contends,
&quot;Through sight, touch, sympathy, and cooperative work, we are with
others.� All these relationships are transitive.� I touch the other, I see the
other.� But I am not the other.� I am all alone.� It is thus the being in me,
the fact that I exist, my existing, that constitutes the absolutely
intransitive element, something without intentionality or relations.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[26]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>���
Levinas explains that the existence of an existent belongs only to itself: this
intransitive fact of existing does not relate to any ultimate horizon of
Being.� </p>


<p  >Levinas
demonstrates a complete separation between existence and the existent through
his descriptions of <i>il y a</i> and hypostasis.�� He explains, &quot;Let us
imagine all things, beings and persons, returning to nothingness.� What remains
after this imaginary destruction of everything is not something, but the fact
that there is [<i>il y a</i>.]&quot;<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[27]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
</p>

<p  >In contrast to Heidegger's
description of Being as a generous field of possibilities, Levinas speaks of
the <i>il y a</i> state as something which imposes itself and which, through
its negation of all particularity, possesses<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
line-height:150%;position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[28]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�everything
within it.� An individual existent does not own existence as its ownmost
potentiality-for-Being, but rather, this anonymous flux of existence persists
by itself.�� </p>


<p  >Echoing RPH's
analysis of the individual's submission to the incumbent past, Levinas
describes the <i>il y a</i> as a state of powerlessness.� In the <i>il y a</i>,
one is compelled to participate anonymously within the flux of Being, denied of
any freedom to start out on one�s own accord.� Levinas compares this to the
state of insomnia.� Trapped in wakefulness, one can not retreat to one�s own
mental space of peaceful isolation.� Similar to the RPH description of
heritage, insomnia denies one the freedom to start out from one�s own present
moment.� Instead, one feels that one merely perpetuates the numbness of an
eternal and vacant past.� </p>


<p  > In RPH, Levinas
described how Christian and Western thought allow individuals the power to
detach themselves from the material world and from the past.� In T&amp;O, he
similarly explains that, through the moment of hypostasis,<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[29]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�the
existent breaks itself free from this anonymous existence, positing itself as
an independent, individuated entity.� By exiting this state of complete
powerlessness and subjection, the ego produces itself as something which has
power.� Levinas explains that the ego has power because it has the capacity to
exist as an individuated identity: &quot;Existing is [the existent�s] own, and
it is precisely through this mastery (whose limits we shall soon see), through
this jealous and unshared mastery over existing, that this existent is alone.�
More exactly, the appearance of an existent is the very constitution of a
mastery, of a freedom in an existing that by itself would remain fundamentally
anonymous.&quot;<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[30]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
</p>


<p  >Like Heidegger,
Levinas locates freedom and mastery in one's ownership of one's own solitary
existence. However, he does not consider this to be a dynamic process.� For
Heidegger, authentic self-mastery attunes <i>Dasein</i> to mobilizing projects
and transiting into the future.� For Levinas, self-mastery enables the ego to
escape the flow of existence by founding a position of stillness.� Rather than
opening up the field of future possibility, hypostasis imbues the ego with the
temporal power of suspending the past and starting out for itself in a present
moment.�� Similarly, consciousness emerges once the self develops its power to
withdraw into its own mental space from the eternal vigilance of impersonal
insomnia. </p>


<p  > Levinas explains that
this solitary self-mastery also produces the enchainment of materiality.<a
href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[31]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� By
producing itself as an entity, the ego (<i>moi</i>) has effectively doubled
itself with a self (<i>soi</i>) to which it is identical.� Levinas explains
that &quot;the relationship with itself is ... the relationship with a double
chained to the ego, a viscous, heavy, stupid, double, but one the ego is with
precisely because it is me.� This <i>with</i> is manifest in the fact that it
is necessary to be occupied with oneself.&quot;<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[32]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
For Levinas, solitary consciousness does not exist as a transcendental
subjectivity that hovers over objects.� Rather, it is produced as an event
through which the ego must relate to itself as a material thing.� In order to
establish an identity within a realm of anonymity, this identity had to start
out from itself and to return to itself.� Through hypostasis, the ego has
broken free from the <i>il y a </i>and escaped its entrapment in an impersonal
state of being.� However, it discovers that, within the sovereignty of its
reflexive solitude, it can not detach itself from itself.� It has become the
captive of its own identity.�� Although the ego has established an independent
space, it has no where to go but itself.� It has established a present moment
for itself, but it has no way to progress into the future. </p>


<p  > As in RPH, Levinas
analyzes physical existence as a burden the self must overcome. He explains
that &quot;everyday life is a preoccupation with salvation&quot;<a
href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[33]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�from
this materiality.� Similarly, Levinas echoes the previous essay's analysis of
light as the medium that liberal, enlightenment thought used to detach itself
from the concrete world.� According to T&amp;O, the ego finds some salvation
from its material enchainment through the exteriority produced by light.� Light
establishes a distance between the self and sensory phenomena.� By allowing the
ego to enjoy the sensational qualities of external objects, this light provides
a detour between the ego�s departure from itself and its inevitable return to
itself.� Because this interval is finite, however, the ego can never fully
escape the concrete position that it had established for itself.� </p>


<p  >The illuminated
world constitutes a region of exteriority through which the ego can diverge
from itself.� However, the ego�s departures are limited by objects which,
because they are ultimately absorbed back into the self, can not take the ego
beyond itself.� Levinas explains that the light that distinguishes phenomena
make them appear as if they were already present within the ego�s
consciousness.� That is, illumination converts worldly entities into objects
that refer back to the self.� Because this light can potentially be extended to
all phenomena, it enables this consciousness to acquire universal knowledge
regarding the world.� By establishing the subject as the center of this
universe, however, this light consummates its solitude.� Levinas explains,
&quot;The intentionality of consciousness allows one to distinguish the ego from
things, but it does not make solipsism disappear:� its element - light -
renders us master of the exterior world but is incapable of finding a peer for
us there.&quot;<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[34]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Therefore, light provides the ego with the ultimate power of solipsism.�
Through hypostasis, the ego had achieved mastery over the random flux of
existence by achieving a mastery over itself.� By internalizing all phenomena
within the light of its own consciousness, the ego extends this lonely dominion
over the entire world.</p>


<p  > Whereas Levinas concludes
that the attempt to find <i>salvation</i> through the illuminated world buries
the ego deeper within its material isolation, he states, &quot;Life could only
become the path of <i>redemption</i> if, in its struggle with matter, it
encounters an event that stops its everyday transcendence from falling back
upon a point that is always the same.&quot;<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
line-height:150%;position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[35]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Here, Levinas seems to be employing the same distinction between salvation and
redemption he introduced in RPH.� In that essay, he described the Christian
concept of salvation as the power of renewal which allows the soul to detach
itself from historical incumbency, enabling it to choose its commitments
freely.� In contrast, Judaism taught that, by admitting to one�s own radical
powerlessness, one could be redeemed from the weight of the past.� Levinas had
further correlated this Jewish expression of powerlessness with the subject�s
experience of pain.� These same motifs reverberate within T&amp;O.� </p>


<p  >Just as the ego�s
virile hypostasis reverted back into the incumbency of materiality, its mastery
over the illuminated world reverts back into a state of powerlessness.� Light
discloses a world which, because it seems to have come from the subject, it can
therefore dominate.� However, the ego still has to exert effort to grasp these
phenomena which present themselves at a distance from its immobile position.�
In order to conquer the external world, the ego must therefore subject itself
to the pain necessary for work.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[36]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
As in RPH, Levinas emphasizes that this pain is physical and that it is founded
upon the self�s incapacity to escape it. He states, &quot;Physical suffering in
all its degrees entails the impossibility of detaching oneself from the instant
of existence ... In suffering there is an absence of all refuge.� It is the
fact of being directly exposed to being.� It is made up of the impossibility of
fleeing or retreating.� The whole acuity of suffering lies in this
impossibility of retreat.&quot;<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[37]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Levinas describes this pain to which the solitary subject is reduced as a state
of complete subjection to the present moment.� Like insomnia, suffering is a
relentless, inexorable condition.� However, insomnia occurred within the
depersonalization of the <i>il y a</i>.� In contrast, the suffering ego has
already individuated itself from this anonymous existence, but the safe refuge
it has created has turned into a prison, chaining it even more tightly to this
inescapable existence.</p>


<p  > The pathos of suffering
evokes the proximity of death.� According to Heidegger, the confrontation with
death fills <i>Dasein</i> with anxiety towards its future, giving it the power
to authentically project its possibilities.� Conversely, for Levinas, one�s
unhappiness about one's everyday suffering and one's preoccupation with
salvation are more salient than the anxiety one feels towards one's ultimate
ending.� The concrete realities of physical pain take priority over this
ontological agony.� Subverting Heidegger�s analysis of Being-towards-Death,
Levinas insists that &quot;the man condemned to die straightens out his uniform
before his last walk, accepts a final cigarette, and finds an eloquent word
before the salvo.&quot;<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[38]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Even in the face of the very real possibility of factical death, individuals
are still primarily concerned about their material dignity rather than about
authenticity.� </p>

<p  ><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  > In opposition to
Heidegger�s description of an assertive confrontation with death, Levinas
contends that death imposes itself upon a passive ego.� Levinas denies
Heidegger�s heroic image of death by refusing to equate it with nothingness.�
&quot;Nothingness is impossible.� It is nothingness that would have left
humankind the possibility of assuming death and snatching a supreme mastery
from out of the servitude of existence.&quot;<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
line-height:150%;position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[39]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
As in RPH, Levinas refutes the attempt to locate a power in a condition of
bondage. He does not define death as a nothingness, but rather seems to equate
it with dissolution back into the anonymity of the <i>il y a</i>.� Death does
not allow one to seize the Being which is one's ownmost; instead, one is seized
by an existence which belongs to no one.� Levinas explains, &quot;Death in
Heidegger is an event of freedom, whereas for me the subject seems to reach the
limit of the possible in suffering.� It finds itself enchained, overwhelmed,
and in some way passive.&quot;<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[40]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>���
Death absolutely terminates the ego's quest to project its possibilities,
neutralizing the mastery achieved through hypostasis and vision.</p>


<p  >Along with
overturning Heidegger's association of death with power, he also subverts its
link to vision. He explains, &quot;Being towards death, in Heidegger�s
authentic existence, is a supreme lucidity and hence a supreme virility.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[41]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� By
looking deeply into the nothingness of death, <i>Dasein</i> illuminates its
need to master its ownership of Being.� When <i>Dasein</i> elucidates the fact
that this nothingness represents the uttermost possibility of its
impossibility, it achieves the possibility of seizing authentic possibilities.�
In contrast, Levinas insists upon the absolute obscurity of mortality. Because
it would eradicate the subject who relates to the world through light, death is
manifested as completely unknowable, a mystery that inspires terror in the
suffering ego.</p>


<p  >Unable to master
death through the medium of light, the ego comes to recognize its ultimate
passivity.� &quot;Death does not announce a reality against which nothing can
be done, against which our power is insufficient -- realities exceeding our
strength already arise in the world of light.� What is important about the
approach of death is that at a certain moment we are no longer able to be
able.&quot;<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[42]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In this statement, Levinas refutes the idea of mastering death as a category
error:� death is not merely an obstacle in the ego�s attempt to dominate the
world, but rather the event which denies the ego the opportunity of even making
an initial effort.� Instead, death absolutely overwhelms the ego.� It imposes
itself as something which did not originate within the ego and which can not be
absorbed back into the self.� </p>


<p  > Unlike the anxiety
which is one�s ownmost, the ego�s suffering indicates that it does not exist by
itself. Suffering exposes the solitary existent to the Other of death, a state
over which the ego has no power and which can not occur in the present moment
secured by hypostasis.��� Even though this event surpasses its consciousness,
however, the ego can still maintain a relationship with death.� That is, the
ego is not totally absorbed into death as it was in the <i>il y a</i>, but can
still relate to it as an individuated identity.��� This capacity to relate to
the termination of one�s present is granted by the ego�s relationship with the
human, futural Other.� </p>


<p  >Levinas describes
the ego�s capacity to relate to this termination of itself through futurity as
a &quot;vanquishing of death.&quot; For him, this does not constitute another
power.� He explains, &quot;Is there another mastery in the human other than the
virility of grasping the possible, the <i>power to be able</i>?� If we find it,
it is in ... the relationship with the Other.&quot;<a href="#_ftn43"
name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[43]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>���
Like the Jew who finds redemption by admitting to his powerlessness, the ego's
capacity to persist does not emanate from its own sovereignty, but from the
interval granted to it by the Other. Through this relationship with the Other,
the ego can welcome an event that lies outside of its power to grasp or view.</p>


<p  > The relationship with
the Other depends on a paradoxical type of visual interaction.� This encounter
displays something that lies before the ego�s eyes yet whose alterity evades
its horizons.� Levinas explains that one does not usually recognize the alterity
of the Other because &quot;one has encountered the Other already veiled by
decency.&quot;<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[44]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
One generally views the Other as merely a semblance.� Reducing the Other to
something that sight can appropriate, an appearance hides the true visual
manifestation of the Other.� However, a closer look at the Other�s face (<i>visage</i>)
reveals someone who exists beyond the sensible, illuminated world given to the
subject.� </p>


<p  >The visual
interaction with the Other disrupts the self's mastery more profoundly than the
confrontation with death.�� Levinas observes that &quot;one is unable in [the
Other�s] regard.&quot;<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[45]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Being subjected to the Other's viewpoint arrests the ego�s solitary effort to
dominate the world.� The very presence of the Other indicates an absence which
the ego can never appropriate as its own.� However the Other�s alterity does
not consist of a power which is qualitatively greater than the ego�s
domination.� Levinas explains, &quot;The Other is, for example, weak, poor,
�the widow and the orphan�, whereas I am the rich or the powerful.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[46]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The Other does not struggle with the ego as another virile individual, but
rather the Other�s weakness disrupts the ego�s impulse towards mastery. </p>


<p  > Rather than attempting
to conquer the Other, the ego relates to the Other erotically in a manner that
respects its vulnerability.� This relationship renders the self susceptible to
the Other's touch, invading and wounding the ego, disrupting its sovereignty.�
The intercourse between the self and the Other gives birth to a child posited
in a new spatial location and a new temporal moment.�� Through the futurity
produced by this fecundity, the relationship with the Other grants the ego
powers and visual capabilities which it did not possess in the present.� </p>


<p  >The ego�s
relationship with the Other opens it up to death and rebirth. The self
renounces the powers of its present incarnation so that it can be reproduced as
an Other in the future.� Levinas explains that the erotic relationship
&quot;opens up new perspectives on the ungraspable&quot; and that the Other
constitutes an &quot;absence in a horizon of the future, an absence that is
time.� This is the horizon where a personal life can be constituted in the
heart of a transcendental event, what I called before �the victory over
death�.&quot;<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[47]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
The ego exists beyond death because, through the relationship with the Other,
it is reborn into a new moment and a new light beyond its present
circumstances.� Instead of mastering its future through authentic
self-projection, the ego relates to this future rebirth as a father does to a
son, recreated in a new person who is both the other and the same as itself.� </p>

>C.� &quot;Is Ontology
Fundamental?&quot; (1951)</span></b></a></p>

<a name="Ontology">
<p  > Levinas� post-war
critique of Heidegger culminates in his sharpest and most direct attack,
&quot;Is Ontology Fundamental?&quot; [IOF]� Through a deepening of his analysis
of light, Levinas determines a new path for uprooting the primacy of ontology
and for transcending &quot;the climate of Heideggerian philosophy.&quot;�
T&amp;O described an impersonal existence, the <i>il y a,</i> as a foil against
the intimacy which Heidegger establishes between Being and <i>Dasein</i>.� In
IOF, Levinas explains that Heidegger articulates this primordial connection as
the lighting of Being�s unconcealment through <i>Dasein</i>.� By questioning
the primacy of vision and light and by showing how these relationships exclude
the Other, Levinas demonstrates why dialogically relating to the Other is
better than ontology.� </p>


<p  > Elaborating his
previous remarks on transitivity, Levinas explains that, for Heidegger,
&quot;the transitive character of the verb �to know� is attached to the verb
�to exist.�&quot;<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[48]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Despite all of his innovations, Heidegger still retains the traditional view
that all relations in Being can be described in terms of the light of knowledge
and the gnosis of vision.� Levinas commends fundamental ontology for uprooting
the detached viewpoint of classical theoretical philosophy.� &quot;This
possibility of conceiving contingency and facticity, not as facts open to
intellection, but as the act of intellection, this possibility of making
visible in the brutality of given contents and facts the transitiveness of
comprehending and a 'signifying intention' ... constitutes the great novelty of
contemporary ontology.&quot;<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span

Heidegger challenges both the Platonic model of a soul that co-exists with
eternal ideas and the Cartesian notion of a mental substance detached from
empirical facts. For him, each individual exists as a <i>Dasein</i> which is
always and already involved in a temporal world.� Therefore, <i>Dasein</i> does
not merely sit back as a spectator who observes objects.� Instead, <i>Dasein</i>'s
visual modalities commit it<i> </i>towards its world, defining its affectivity
and its involvement.� </p>

<p  > </p>

<p  >By questioning the
classical visual paradigm, fundamental ontology limits the power of
spectatorship.� &quot;To relate oneself to a being inasmuch as it is a being,
means for Heidegger to let the being be, to comprehend it as independent of the
perception which discovers and grasps it.&quot;� Not only does Heidegger�s
analysis of engaged existence demonstrates the limits of theoretical mastery
over the world, it also shows that <i>Dasein</i> does not even exert complete
control over its own being.� &quot;Our consciousness, and therefore our mastery
of reality, does not exhaust our relation with reality, in which we are always
present with the full gravity of our being.� Or again, consciousness of reality
does not coincide with our habitation in the world.&quot;<a href="#_ftn50"
name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[50]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� <i>Dasein</i>
does not inhabit a detached position hovering over phenomena.� Therefore, it
can never manipulate existence enough to guarantee its absolute mastery. At
best, <i>Dasein</i>, as a Being-in-the-World, must authentically accept that
temporality, as the forces of heritage and fate, render it unable either to
be-a-basis of itself or to control the consequences of the possibilities it
projects.</p>


<p  > Although Heidegger's
analysis effectively demonstrates the limits of human vision and mastery, his
fundamental ontology still remains a philosophy of lucidity. Heidegger defines <i>Dasein</i>�s
existence as a &quot;there&quot;, a location within a horizon of Being and a
site for Being�s unconcealment.� Not only does the lighting of anonymous Being
determine human existence, Heidegger describes <i>Dasein</i>�s particular
relationships with the world in terms of sight.� That is, all of <i>Dasein</i>'s
temporal engagements are determined by the way it visually comprehends the
world through the light of Being. Circumspection (<i>umsicht), </i>for example,
discovers ready-to-hand things that already refer to how <i>Dasein</i> can use
them.� Levinas asserts, &quot;It is thus that Heidegger describes in their most
formal structure, the articulations of vision where the relation of the subject
with the object is subordinated to the relation of the object with the light,
which is not an object.� The understanding of a being will thus consist in
going beyond the being, into the <i>openness</i>, and in perceiving it with<i>in
the horizon of� being.</i>&quot;<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[51]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Despite all of his philosophical innovations, Heidegger follows a traditional
optical model that subordinates the particular to the universal. Even though <i>Dasein</i>
does not internalize an object within its consciousness as a classical subject
would, it still views beings by going beyond their specificity in order to
envision them in the luminous horizon of Being.� </p>


<p  >The ontological
model goes beyond the individual being to the Being of the being.� Because
Being exists through <i>Dasein, Dasein </i>finds all of its potentialities
within this light. However, Levinas asserts that this viewpoint ignores the
exceptional position of the Other.� The general horizon of Being only
illuminates certain ways of knowing the Other. The Other�s alterity, his
existence as a separate being, remains entirely refractory to vision and
possession.� I<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span ><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span >[52]</span></span></span></span></a>
can not acquire a total comprehension of the Other because, in the face to face
encounter with the Other, the visual relationship becomes doubled up with and
ultimately conditioned by a prior linguistic relationship.</p>


<p  > Levinas opposes the
philosophical motif of visuality and the correlated notion of comprehensive
reason by asserting that language -- an irreducible &quot;judicious
language&quot;<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[53]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�--
conditions the possibility of sight.� As in<i> </i>T&amp;O, Levinas explains
that vision finds its limit during the encounter with the visage of the Other.�
I can not appropriate or exercise power over the Other as if he were either an
object internalized by a subject or a revelation of Being.� &quot;Here
perception is not projected towards a horizon, which as the field of my
liberty, power, and property presents itself as the familiar basis upon which
to grasp the individual.� It refers to the pure individual.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[54]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas explains that I can not grasp the particular Other against a background
of universality because of the manner in which the Other manifests himself:� I
view the Other in his &quot;depth&quot;<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
line-height:150%;position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[55]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�as
an independent being who can see me looking at him. &quot;My comprehension of
this being as such is already the expression I offer him of this very
comprehension. &quot;<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[56]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The vision of the Other coincides with an invocation of the Other; I can not
know him without already acknowledging him.� In this face-to-face
confrontation, my visual orientation towards the Other doubles as a linguistic
relationship between us.� Because I must speak to the individual Other whom I
encounter, I can not detach him from his particularity by locating him in a
universal horizon. Therefore, the interlocutory Other always remains outside of
my comprehension and beyond my power.</p>


<p  > Levinas explains why it
is inappropriate, if not impossible, to try to relate to the Other through the
mediation of the light.� By viewing the Other in the context of Being rather
than directly confronting his visage, I violate his alterity.� I do not
encounter an individual human Other, but rather a being that offers itself for
my possession. However, this attempt to dominate the Other through vision
ultimately fails.� Although one can acquire categorical knowledge pertaining to
the Other through sight and consciousness, the Other�s living presence remains
refractory to this power.� Whereas T&amp;O<i> </i>described the termination of
the solitary existent�s power as death, IOF contends that the possession of the
Other is only possible as complete negation, as murder.� However, even murder
can not provide me with an absolute power over the Other.� Although a man does
possess the actual power to kill another man, this does not make the other man
his possession.� I can only grasp the Other in the horizon of Being as a set of
dead qualities, but can never appropriate his living being.� Because even this
ultimate attempt of negation never exercises any complete domination over the
Other, Levinas states that the Other presents himself as an infinite resistance
to my power and my murderous will.</p>


<p  > After interrogating the
primacy of vision and power in classical ontological thought, Levinas proposes
that reason should be secondary to language in philosophical discourse.� He
questions whether previous notions of rationality have lent themselves to justifying
domination and violence; he wonders whether these characterizations have done
it justice. <a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[57]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a></p>

<p  style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Is the rational reducible to power over
an object?� Is reason domination where the resistance of a being as such is
surmounted, not in an appeal to this very resistance, but as a ruse of the
hunter who ensnares all that a being contains of strength and irreducibility on
the basis of its weaknesses, its place in the horizon of the universal?� Does
understanding as ruse, understanding belonging to struggle and violence over
things, extend to the constitution of the human order?� </p>


<p  >This statement seem to comprise
Levinas' doubts towards ontological, both classical and Heideggerian, models of
comprehension.� Ontological thought has understood understanding through
metaphors of vision.� By doing so, philosophers have described thinking as the
power which enables an autonomous subject or an authentic <i>Dasein</i> to
reduce the multiplicity of exteriority into universal categories, subsuming the
totality into a consciousness.� By exercising its domination over worldly
contingencies, the subject or <i>Dasein</i> has thereby acquired its freedom.� </p>


<p  >As in his 1934
essay &quot;Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism&quot;, Levinas fears the
implications of equating the quest for truth with force and dramatic struggle.�
According to Levinas, both the classical and Heidegger's models of thought as
domination and possession have ultimately led to an ontological elevation of
war, struggle, and violence.� Levinas continues his interrogations, wondering
&quot;Are we not accustomed, albeit paradoxically, to seeking in struggle the
very manifestation of spirit and its reality?&quot; <a href="#_ftn58"
name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[58]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Refuting
these conceptions of reasons, Levinas answers his rhetorical questions,
&quot;Is not the order of reason constituted rather in a situation where 'one
chats,' where the resistance of a being as a being is not broken, but
pacified&quot;<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:150%;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[59]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
Levinas responds to the violence of ontology, to philosophy as violence, by
founding reason on the social relation of speech. According to him, peace can
only develop from a conversation with an Other human being who can express his
individual voice.<br clear=all >

> The usage of genders and
pronouns changes significantly at key moments in this thesis.� Because modern
philosophy has typically constructed the subject as a masculine, I will use
masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to it.� That is, I will not attempt to
masquerade this inherent sexism by alternating gendered pronouns.� In contrast,
Dasein for Heidegger does not signify a sexed human being, but rather the
historical space for Being�s unconcealment.� Therefore, I will use the pronoun
�it� to refer to this phenomenon.� In his earliest works, Levinas seems to echo
Heidegger�s ontological tone, so I will also use the pronoun �it� to refer to
the ego.� In later works, however, he insists that the relationship with the
Other starts with me.� To indicate this shift, I will begin writing in the
first-person-singular.� Levinas� usage of gender is quite complicated.� &nbsp;
Levinas founds his opposition to totalizing philosophy upon the bedrock of
gendered distinctions.&nbsp; He states, �The difference between the sexes is a
formal structure, but one that carves up reality in another sense and
conditions the very possibility of reality as multiple, against the unity of
being proclaimed by Parmenides.�<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a

>The
notion of a contract also recurs in Levinas� later works.� In addition to
notion of a legal contract as the instantiation of a bond, Levinas might also
be suggesting another meaning of this word.� �Contract� means to become
smaller, to fold up within oneself.� In </span><i><span style='color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline'>Existence and Existents</span></i><span
>, for
example, Levinas analyzes the moment of hypostasis as the contraction of
existence and the production of an individuated existent.� This signification
of �contract� as shrinking also resonates with the notions of excendence /
transcendence and the description of the Other as the Most High.� Levinas might
also be referring to Isaac Luria�s theology of a God who contracts within
himself in order to make space for the world.� See Gershom Scholem, </span><i><span

>In the haunting preface to
Existence and Existents, Levinas apologizes, saying �These studies begun before
the war were continued and written for the most part in captivity.� The stalag
is evoked here not as a guarantee of profundity, nor as a claim to indulgence,
but as an explanation for the absence of any consideration of those philosophical
works published, with so much impact, between 1940 and 1945.�� [Emmanuel
Levinas, Existence and Existents<i> </i>(trans. Alphonso Lingis. The
Hague:&nbsp; Martinus Nijhoff, 1978), 15.] In the same spirit, these facts are
cited not to give Levinas� voice the authority of a martyr, but rather to
locate historically the urgent tone of Levinas� post-war writings.� </span></a></span></p>

<p  > Levinas�
analysis of light and his opposition to Heidegger can be understood through a
comparison of the Jewish and the Christian accounts of creation.� Following
Nietzsche, Heidegger explicitly critiques Christianity as a popularization of
the Platonic reduction of the logos (<span >logoV</span>.)
Heidegger contends that the logos originally referred to Dasein as the
gathering-place for the strife (<span >polemoV</span>)
of Being.� Christianity obscures this notion of logos-as-gathering by
interpreting Christ as the logos.� Following the Alexandrian-Jewish<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�philosopher
Philo, the Gospel of John describes Jesus as the phenomenon which mediates
man�s relationship with the divine.� Furthermore, John 1:9 explains Christ as
the source of divine light as it is revealed to men, �That was the true Light,
which lights every man that comes into the world.�� Therefore, this book
collapses the concept of the logos as light with the notion of a publicly
accessible Word which subsists outside of man�s existence.� Against this,
Heidegger forwards an almost Gnostic idea<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[2]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�that
each Dasein, as an individual, can potentially exist as its own true light,
lighting itself as it comes into the world.� In contrast to both John�s and
Heidegger�s accounts of revelation, the Book of Genesis introduces God�s first
act of creation in the following manner: �And God said, �Let there be light�
and there was light.�� Contrary to the implicit claims of both John and Philo,
this verse does not merely imply that revelation occurs through a substantive
word, through the nominal.� Rather, it describes the light of phenomena as
preceded by and issuing forth from God�s exercise of speech.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� </p>


<p  > Levinas
describes the light of truth and of representation as something which becomes
manifested between speaking interlocutors.� In his book <u>Totality and
Infinity</u>, he carefully describes the phenomenological transformations of
this discussion.� Levinas describes me as I posit myself in a �Now,� in a
present moment in which I speak to the Other, am heard by her, and receive a
reply from him.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[4]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
As with Heidegger, Levinas employs the resources of Husserl�s phenomenology to
follow the course of this discussion.� Although Levinas, like Heidegger,
opposes Husserl�s model of intentionality for implicitly positing a
spectatorial subject which merely looks at an object, he finds metaphysical
notions within Husserl which subvert the apparent ontological interpretations.�
He claims that Husserl�s major insight was that �notions under the direct gaze
of thought that defines them are nevertheless, unbeknown to this naive thought
revealed to be implanted in horizons unsuspected by this thought ... The
break-up of the formal structure of thought (the noema of a noesis) into events
which this structure dissimulates, but which sustain it and restore its
concrete significance, constitutes a <i>deduction</i> � necessary and yet
non-analytical.�<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[5]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas demonstrates that the intentional relationship which separates
consciousness from its objects is not foundational, but rather is itself
produced through certain genealogical developments of the relationship between
the Other and me.� </p>


<p  > Levinas
claims, �The difference between the Other and me do not depend upon different
properties. ... They are due to the I-Other conjunction, to the inevitable <i>orientation</i>
of being �starting from oneself� towards �the Other.�� The priority of this
orientation over the terms that are placed in it (and which can not arise
without this orientation) summarizes the theses of the present work.�<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[6]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas description of Being is as radically perspectival as Nietzsche�s.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[7]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
However, whereas Nietzsche describes the experiences of a subject whose being
and whose perspectives are determined by its will to power, Levinas describes
my experiences in having my being and my perspectives be determined by my
ethical position as the interlocutor of the Other.� Derrida�s analysis of the
structure of Levinas� writing illuminates his intricate perspectivism.� �In <u>Totality
and Infinity</u> the thematic development is neither purely descriptive nor
purely deductive.� It proceeds with the infinite insistence of waves on a
beach:� return and repetition, always, of the same wave against the same shore,
in which however, as each return recapitulates itself, it also infinitely
renews and enriches itself.�<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[8]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
As Heidegger might say, Levinas� writing repeatedly presents the same �factical
situation,� yet, each time, it thematizes this situation from a new
perspective.� By varying perspectives, Levinas does not merely give the reader
a �better view� of the same event.� Rather, these different perspectives constitute
each situation as a new and different ontological, phenomenological, and
metaphysical event.� These perspectives are produced as and through my
intercourse with the Other.� The evolution and transformation of our discussion
produces intentional relationships which connect us and which orient me
metaphysically.� I speak to the Other who responds to me.� As will be shown in
this paper, each event within this complex intercourse reveals its own
intentional horizons.� </p>


<p  > To
fully understand Levinas� conception of vision and power, one must trace how
these capacities evolve and transform throughout each stage of my ethical
development.� Against Heidegger�s description of Dasein as a dynamic
temporalization, Levinas analyzes the time of discourse as a series of
discrete, separated moments in which I am born, die and am reborn.� In <u>Time
and the Other</u>, he describes the birth of an individuated ego as his power
to posit his identity, thereby escaping from the <i>there is</i>, an impersonal
and eternal realm of undifferentiated existence.� <u>Totality and Infinity</u>
no longer refers to this event of separation as a power, but rather as the
capacity to resist totalization.� Levinas states, �The separation of the Same
is produced in the form of an inner life, as psychism ... It is already <i>a
way of being</i>, resistance to this totality. ... The dimension of the
psychism opens under the force of the resistance a being opposes to its
totalization.�<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[9]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In direct opposition to Heidegger�s assertion that Dasein�s power develops from
its futural appropriation of its heritage, Levinas explains that my capacity to
resist the weight of the past in a present moment constitutes my force of
resistance.� Previous to this moment of separation, this separation in and as a
moment, I had effectively perished when my works and my statements were
alienated from myself by the impersonal institutions and public interpretations
which subsumed them.� I break with the domination of the totality by shedding
my former manifestation and founding myself in a new moment in which I have an
opportunity to make a new statement.� Not only does this psychism separate me
temporally, it also separates me ontologically.� Against Heidegger who sees
Dasein�s Being as always embedded within the impersonal dominance of Being, Levinas
reappropriates the Cartesian distinction between an internal mental sphere and
an external reality.� According to Levinas, I resist being absorbed by the
tyranny of Being by establishing the limit of my identity and creating an
interior psychical realm which can not be violated by any external force or
person.</p>


<p  > My
birth in the instant initiates the life cycle of the moment.� Therefore, my
separated existence begins in the infantile state of enjoyment.� I steep myself
in the elemental qualities of the world, experiencing my sensations as the
contents of my existence.� Levinas explains that this state arises prior to my
development of a vision or a consciousness which would posit the world as a set
of individuated objects. He states, �...The sensible life is lived as
enjoyment.� This mode of life is not to be interpreted in function of
objectification ... Sensation recovers a �reality� when we see in it not the
subjective counterpart of objective qualities, but an enjoyment anterior to the
crystallization of consciousness, I and non-I, subject and object�<a

><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[10]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Because
I bathe in the elemental medium I enjoy, I can not assume any external point of
view regarding it.� For example, I do not experience the analytic qualities of
the painting I view, but rather I live from my immersion in these colors.� In
order for me to view this painting as an object, I must have already submerged
myself in the painting�s affective qualities.� Not only does enjoyment precede
my capacity to view objects, it also occurs before I have the capacity to
represent my own existence to myself.� Because I absorb myself in an elemental
medium, I can not achieve a distance from myself from which I can observe
myself.� Through this analysis of enjoyment, Levinas describes a relationship
with the world which arises prior to my understanding of the world as a set of
usable tools.� For Heidegger, circumspection requires Dasein to view both the
beings in the world and its own potentiality-for-Being.� Because enjoyment
precedes the objectification of vision, it also prevents me from manipulating
the world as a set of objects.� Levinas explains that, �Tools themselves, which
are in-view-of-...become objects of enjoyment.�<a href="#_ftn11"

Against Heidegger, Levinas would claim that before I turn a handle to go through
a door, I enjoy the sensation of cold brass pressing against my palm.� </p>


<p  > Although
this state of enjoyment precedes my development of vision, Levinas does not
conclude that I am sightless, but rather that this state can not be
circumscribed within this dialectic.� Levinas only employs the language of
blindness to describe entities which lose their identity when they are forced
to participate in the totality of the <i>there is</i>.� He states,
�To-be-in-the-element does indeed disengage a being from blind and deaf
participation in a whole, but differs from a thought making its way outward.�<a

Because the <i>there is</i>� forces everything to go along with the current of
anonymous existence, it subsists prior to the self-identification of an I who
can feel its existence and its pleasures as its own.� Through my sensibility, I
overcome my depersonalization, separating myself from the <i>there is.</i>�
However, this absorption in the elemental does not allow me the imperialistic
freedom which I weld through representational vision.� Whereas vision requires
a distance from which to view objects, the elemental I merges with the
element.� �I am content ... with this horizon in which I live, turn to me; I do
not ground them in a more vast system.� It is they that ground me.� I welcome
them without thinking them.�<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span

Levinas� reference to <i>horizons</i>&nbsp;and his statement that �liberation <i>flashes</i>
in the <i>light</i> of happiness, in separation�<a href="#_ftn14"

that the state of enjoyment is determined by a certain intentional
relationship.� However, rather than establishing my own horizons through a
noetic intention, the enjoying I finds itself already implanted within certain
horizons.� As will be explained below, these horizons of separation ultimately
emerge from the light emanated by my mother and father, the Other. </p>


<p  > Through
this description of life as enjoyment, Levinas allies himself with a Reichean
strategy of opposing the affirmation of pleasure to totalitarian control.� He
states �Here lies the permanent truth of hedonist moralities:� to not seek,
behind the satisfaction of need, an order relative to which alone satisfaction
would acquire a value; to take satisfaction, which is the very meaning of
pleasure, as a term.�<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[15]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Levinas
makes this radical embrace of sensuous pleasure central to the relationship
between the Other and me.� Both the Other and I exist as our love of our lives.
This enables each of us to exist as separated entities who resist being reduced
to abstract categories.� By affirming the importance of enjoyment, Levinas answers
Nietzsche�s claim that morality is grounded in a life-negating, ascetic <i>ressentiment.</i>�
Sounding very much like the Nietzschean philosopher Georges Bataille, he
states, �To enjoy without utility, in pure loss, gratuitously, without
referring to anything else, in pure expenditure � this is the human.�<a
href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[16]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Furthermore, Levinas explains that, throughout the ethical relationship with
the Other, I always maintain my separation through my sensibility.� �Whatever
be the transfigurations this egoism will receive from speech, it is for the
happiness constitutive of this very egoism that the I who speaks pleads.�<a
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[17]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Through this concept of enjoyment, Levinas adopts Nietzsche�s idea that
philosophy should affirm life while rejecting his assertion that this affirmation
must be an expression of a will-to-power.� He thereby avoids the nihilism of
traditional morality, yet does not describe life as a virile existence based
either on heroic self-projection like Heidegger or on brutal excess like
Bataille.� </p>


<p  > By
making enjoyment the initial mode of relating to the world of things, Levinas
subverts the notion of virility implicit in Heidegger�s description of
concern.� As described in <u>Being and Time</u>, Dasein�s relationship with the
world as equipment posits Dasein as the master over the world of objects,
manipulating them to suit its own ends, to project its own possibilities.<a
href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[18]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
contrast, the enjoying I relates to the element through a paradoxical
combination of sovereignty and submission.� Immersed in the elemental medium, I
possess the qualities it offers to the extent that I let myself be possessed by
it.� Levinas contends, �The paradox of �living from something� ... is precisely
a complacency with regard to what life depends on � not a mastery on one hand
and a dependence on the other, but a mastery in this dependence.� Living
from... is the dependency that turns into sovereignty, into happiness �
essentially egoist.�<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[19]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Absorbed in pure sensual qualities such as the warm radiance of the sun, I
depend upon the alterity of what it is not myself as the contents of my
existence.� At the same time, I integrate these sensations into my interiority,
thereby establishing my own independence.� In contrast to Heidegger who
analyzes of thrownness as the submission of Dasein, Levinas� discussion of
sensibility outlines a more symbiotic relationship.</p>


<p  > Levinas
explores the paradoxical coincidence of the enjoying I�s submission and mastery
through his descriptions of suffering and need.� For the newly-birthed I,
suffering functions as the relative negation of enjoyment.� He states, �The
happiness of enjoyment flourishes on the �pain� of need and thus depends on an
�other��<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[20]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Similarly,
he states, �Far from putting the sensible life into question, pain takes place
within its horizons and refers to the joy of living.�<a href="#_ftn21"
name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[21]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas explains that my satisfaction with the fulfillment of my needs
determines my life of happiness.� This satisfaction develops from the suffering
I feel from being dependent upon the relative alterity of the element.� This
suffering therefore does not contradict my enjoyment, but rather acts as a foil
which I oppose in the name of more enjoyment.� Levinas explains that my
dependence upon the elemental medium threatens me with the insecurity of the
future.� Because these momentary sensations are immediate and evanescent, the
unforeseeable future threatens to disintegrate them.� However, I can flee from
the deprivation of my needs in search of enjoyment.� The insecurity I feel
wrenches me out of the present, opening me up to a duration during which I can
forestall this disappearance.� Whereas my dependence upon my milieu causes me
to suffer, my needs determine my sovereignty.� �The alterity of the other the
world is is surmounted by need, which enjoyment remembers and is kindled by;
need is the primary movement of the same.� To be sure, need is also a
dependence with regard to the other, but it is a dependence across time ...
Needs are in my power.� They constitute me as the same and not as dependent on
the other.�<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[22]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
By founding an interval of duration between myself and the immediacy of the
element, I establish a distance through which I can subordinate the relative
alterity of the milieu in the satisfaction of my needs.� </p>


<p  > I
articulate an interval which separates me from the element through the founding
of a corporeal domicile.� I establish this home through my intimate
relationship with the gentle visage of the feminine Other.<a href="#_ftn23"
name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[23]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The home enables me to mature from my infancy into my manhood.� Through it, I
can transform the antecedent, conditioning influences of the element into
things which seem to be posterior to and conditioned by my consciousness.�
Levinas states, �Consciousness of a world is already consciousness <i>through </i>that
world.� Something of that world seen is an organ or an essential means of
vision ... Hence the subject contemplating a world presupposes the event of
dwelling, the withdrawal from the elements ... recollection in the intimacy of
the home.�<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[24]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas� usage the term �recollection� to refer to this withdrawal from and
appropriation of the elements seems to be directed at the Socratic theory of
knowledge.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[25]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>���
Socrates argues that all knowledge is derived from the self�s remembrance of
the knowledge which he had obtained during his past lives.� In <u>Totality and
Infinity</u>, Levinas demonstrates that my gnosis and my relationship with my
past can only be mediated through the Other.� Through the feminine Other who
gives me birth and who listens to my speech, I establish a home which acts as a
precondition for my initiatives of power and my capacity for sight.� Through my
labor, I master the threatening insecurity of the chaotic element by seizing
it.� Levinas states, �Labor in its possessive grasp suspends the independence
of the element:� its being. ...� Possession masters, suspends, postpones the
unforeseeable future of the element � its independence, its being.�<a
href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[26]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� By
distancing myself from my immersion in the milieu, I grasp the element as if it
were matter which offered resistance to my hand.� I exert my power over the
element by positing it as a set of permanent, possessable things which can be
deposited in the dwelling.� The home establishes my psychism by delimiting a
separated position for me.� Labor continues this separation by absenting my
interiority from the works I have objectified so that I can pursue an existence
independent of them.</p>


<p  > The
dwelling and the labor which take place in it enable me to acquire the capacity
for representational vision.� Levinas explains, �The dwelling remains in its
own way open upon the element from which it separates.� The ambiguity of
distance, both removal and connection, is lifted by the window that makes
possible a look that dominates, a look of him who escapes looks, the look that
contemplates.�<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[27]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The home capacitates vision by separating me from the element, giving me a
distance from which to direct a spectatorial gaze at the world.� The home
transforms the sensible enjoyment which conditions me into a spectacle which I
can represent as something conditioned.� �In clarity an object which is first
exterior <i>is given</i>, that is, is delivered over to him who encounters it
as though it had been entirely determined by him.�<a href="#_ftn28"
name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[28]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�Representational
vision therefore functions as perhaps the primary way in which the embodied I
forestalls the insecurity threatened by the unforeseeable future. Levinas
states, �Vision is a forgetting of the <i>there is</i> because of the essential
satisfaction, the agreeableness of sensibility, enjoyment, contentment, with
the finite without concern for the infinite.� In fleeing itself in vision,
consciousness returns to itself.�<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[29]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Whereas the enjoyment of visual sensations separates me from the domination of
the <i>there is</i>, the visual sense as it is articulated in the body enables
me to absorb all phenomena within my own consciousness.� Furthermore, the
temporal interval which is produced as this dwelling suspends my immediate
reactions to the element so that I can observe myself.� Against Heidegger,
Levinas asserts that only an embodied and domiciled I who regards both itself
and objects can relate to the world <i>in view of</i> a greater attention to
its own possibilities.</p>


<p  > Whereas
Heidegger tends to collapse the vision and the grasp, Levinas explains that I
require the labor of the hand before I can develop sight.� The hand establishes
my first mastery over the ominous element.� By assuming the element as a
permanent possession, I stave off the insecurity I feel in the face of the
unforeseeable future, the horror I feel in the face of the <i>there is</i>.� He
states, �Labor, the hold on matter, is not a vision or thought in which matter
already determined would be defined by relation to infinity;� within the grasp
matter precisely remains fundamentally indefinite. ... But it renounces its
anonymity, since the primordial hold of labor introduces it into a world of the
identifiable, masters it.�<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[30]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The hand which labors seizes the element before I have fully articulated the
subject-object distinction which vision capacitates.� Therefore, the hand does
not function with the intentionality of a sense organ, but rather as a blind
grasping which masters the element by relating it to me.� By doing so, the hand
suspends the obscurity of matter, making it identifiable.� Out of the chaotic
and unforeseeable element, labor posits discernible things which I can
represent to myself.� This domination therefore illuminates a world which I can
apprehend in my consciousness.� Levinas explains, �The �representation� of the
end and the movement of the hand that plunges towards it thorough an unexplored
distance, preceded by no searchlight, constitute one and the same event.�<a
href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[31]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The blind groping of the hand therefore determines the world which I can
contemplate as a visual spectator. </p>


<p  > The
development of the visual faculty consummates the foundation of my sovereign
interiority.� Representational vision views the world through the safe distance
which the dwelling effects between the ominous element and me.� The light which
possession sheds upon the world neutralizes the relative alterity of the unforeseeable
element.� After the chaotic element has been stabilized, the securely domiciled
I can comprehend this elemental exteriority within its interior world.� �Vision
is essentially an adequation of exteriority with interiority: in it exteriority
is reabsorbed in the contemplative soul and, as an <i>adequate idea</i>,
revealed to be a priori.�<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[32]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
For Levinas, vision function as the ability to absorb alterity, the ultimate
power of the Same.� In addition to accommodating my power of sight, the house
allows me to maintain the invisibility of my interiority.� The house not only
provides a window through which I can look, it also provides a space in which I
can conceal myself from the outside world, from the element, from the totality,
and even from the gaze of the Other.� Like Gyges, the I who maintains the power
of vision can see everything while evading sight. </p>


<p  > Whereas
the enjoying I constitutes the element only insofar as it is constituted by it,
the seeing I determines alterity without being determined by it.� The visual
sense therefore establishes a distinct type of relationship with the world.�
When I separate myself from the <i>there is</i>, I maintain the rest of the
world in this impersonal totality.� Levinas explains, �Thus appears the
structures of vision, where the relation of the subject with the object is
subordinated to the relation of the object with the void of openness, which is
not an object. ... To comprehend the particular being is to apprehend it out of
an illuminated sight it does not fill.�<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[33]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Sight relates to the world through the void, perceiving it as if it issued from
nothingness.� Whereas labor masters the element by stabilizing it, vision
dominates the objects which it comprehends.� Through this horizon of
generality, thematization surprises and captures existents within my world so
that they surrender themselves over to my consciousness.� The sovereign I
apprehends the word through its own points of view, ascribing significance to
objects according to the relations which it establishes between them.� Vision
perceives objects as phenomena, as mute entities which have no capacity to
respond to the imperialism of the Same.� The independence and resistance of the
world disappear within the consciousness which subsumes it.� Levinas explains
how sight suppresses and possesses the element by suspending its alterity, �The
most ponderous reality envisaged as an object of a thought is engendered in the
gratuitous spontaneity of a thought that thinks it. ... To represent is not to
reduce a past fact to an actual image but to reduce to the instantaneousness of
thought everything that seems independent of it.�<a href="#_ftn34"
name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[34]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� By
suspending the threat of futurity, I reduce the world to the stasis of an
instant in which I maintain the unique power to constitute reality.� Furthermore,
the positing of an interior moment of the present separates me from the past.�
Just as Heidegger calls the stabilization of Being in a factical Situation an
existentially positive �capacity for delusion,� Levinas calls this achievement
of a pure present a �power for illusion.�<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[35]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
�At the very moment of representation the I is not marked by the past but <i>utilizes
</i>it as a represented and objective element.<i>� </i>Illusion?� Ignorance of
its own involvements?� Representation is the force of such an illusion and of
such forgettings.� Representation is the pure present.�<a href="#_ftn36"

For Heidegger, Dasein�s delusory absorption in its facticity distracts it from
the power it attains by accepting its heritage and projecting towards a
future.� Conversely, Levinas asserts that this illusory present establishes the
only true power that I maintain over my world, and that my connection with the
future and the past divest me of my virility.</p>


<p  > Integrating
all alterity into an identity and turning the world into the contents of a consciousness,
sight acts as the most important power which a free and sovereign interiority
can exercise over its world.� The development of vision therefore functions as
the consummation of my autonomy in the world.� By putting boundaries around
myself and stabilizing the <i>there is</i>, I make my interiority invisible to
the world while gazing out at it and referring it back to my own perceptual
horizons.� Like me, the Other maintains a visage through which he can see and
can hide her own alterity.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[37]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The visage of the Other manifests this invisibility.� �Inasmuch as the access
to beings concerns vision, it dominates those beings, exercises a power over
them ... The visage is present in its refusal to be contained ... It is neither
seen nor touched � for in visual or tactile sensation the identity of the I
envelops the alterity of the object, which becomes precisely an object.�<a
href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

The Other�s visage appears in my domicile as a body which, like other material
things, can be subsumed within my consciousness.� However, the visage�s
character as a sensible phenomenon doubles with a transcendent alterity which
always lies outside of the my horizons.� Beyond the Other�s appearance in my
present moment, the Other maintains the capacity to reappear in the
unforeseeable future.� Furthermore, the Other�s alterity can be understood as
the perspectival transformation of Levinas� analysis of my interiority.�
Levinas� statement that �the visage is present in its refusal to be contained�
echoes his notion that my psychism �opens under a force of resistance [it]
opposes to its totalization.�� My interiority enables me to separate myself
from impersonal <i>there is</i>� which would absorb and neutralize me.� Through
my separation, I convert the <i>there is </i>into a light through which I can
absorb exteriority.� The Other�s alterity arises as his resistance to the
totalization which my gaze attempts to impose upon him.<a href="#_ftn39"

<p  > Like
Nietzsche, Levinas employs perspectivism to overcome the synoptic relations
described by idealistic philosophy.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span

He insists, �In the absolute, the subject and the object would still be parts
of the same system, would be enacted and revealed panoramically.� ...
Exteriority is true not in a lateral view apperceiving it in opposition to
interiority;� it is true in a face to face that is no longer entirely vision,
but goes farther than vision.� The face to face is established starting with a
point separated from exteriority so radically that it maintains itself of
itself, is me.�<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span

The face to face relation can only be understood from the perspective of an I
who looks at an Other who gazes back.� Like Heidegger, Levinas asserts that
this gnosis can not be understood existentially from the detached perspective
of a neutral third party who looks at it theoretically.� This panoramic viewpoint
would swallow up the Other and me into an impersonal totality, suppressing the
multiplicity of existents, eradicating the freedom of separated interiority,
and violating the transcendence of alterity.� This impersonal gaze asserts
itself by imposing a universal time upon the Other and me.� It freezes our
images in the historical moment of our deaths during which we can no longer
speak for ourselves.� However, because the conversation between the Other and
me propels us through spirals of death and rebirth, we maintain our capacity to
reply to this totalitarian violence.� By signifying himself through his speech,
the visage of the Other indicates that he can answer for the images which he
presents.� Levinas explains, �Speech is always a taking up again of what was a
simple sign cast forth by it, an ever renewed promise to clarify what was
obscure in the utterance.�<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span

The transcendence of the Other derives from his connection to an unforeseeable
future which can not be envisaged in a moment of vision. �This futurity allows
the Other the infinite capacity to revise the images which he presents in a
present instant.� Because the Other, as an interlocutor, directs and attends to
his appearance, he overflows the representation which I contain within my own consciousness.</p>


<p  > Although
I can not view the Other as an object for my consumption, I do not become blind
during this encounter.� According to Levinas, I can only be considered to be
blind when I am utterly trapped in the undifferentiated realm of the <i>there
is</i>, having no power to assert my own sovereign selfhood.� Conversely, the
face-to-face relationship with the Other requires an I who possesses the full
powers of its selfhood.� Most importantly, this relationship requires an I who
maintains its power of sight.� Because the Other can not be fully absorbed
within the horizons of my consciousness, I perceive that the Other transcends
them.� Therefore, I must look upwards to see him.� That is, the relationship
with the Other requires a certain type of visual intentionality.� Levinas
explains, �The eye can conceive of it only by virtue of position which, as an
above-below disposition, constitutes the elementary fact of morality.�<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[43]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� As
discussed above, the Other�s alterity is quite similar to my interiority.� However,
alterity can not be considered to be the mere correlate of interiority because
the Other can not be considered to be a mere �alter ego� of me.� Interiority
defines the life of a separated I with respect to impersonal totalities.�
Viewed from my perspective, the �interiority� of an Other appears to me as
alterity.� The production of alterity depends upon the visual perspective of an
I which sees something which vanishes from sight.</p>


<p  > Levinas
explains that the intentionality of the face to face does not project from my
understanding, but rather emanates from the Other.� Just as my interiority
enables me to maintain a power of sight, the alterity of the Other enables him
to stare back at me with his own vision.� I do not encounters the Other as a
mere thing, but as a <i>visage</i>, as a being which can see.� Levinas
explains, �Things manifest themselves as answering to a question relative to
which they have a meaning � the question <i>quid</i>? .. The question <i>who? </i>envisages
a visage ... To aim at a visage is to put the question <i>who?</i> to the very
visage that is the answer to this question:� the answerer and the answered
coincide.� The visage, preeminently expression, formulates the first word:� the
signifier arising at the thrust of his sign, as eyes that look at you.�<a
href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[44]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
the relationship with the Other, sight coincides with speech:� the visual
perception of the Other transforms into a discursive relationship with him.� I
can not absorb the Other into my interior world as I do mute objects because
the Other can reply to my gaze with his own.� Levinas implicitly critiques
Heidegger�s emphasis upon the act of questioning for reducing all entities to
the neutral substratum of Being.� Against Heidegger, he asserts that whenever I
ask any question about entities, I must direct this question to my
interlocutor, the Other.� More significantly, the question asked <i>about</i>
the Other can not be answered by Being, but only by the Other.� Before I can <i>grasp</i>
the Other as a sensible content of my consciousness, the Other has already signified
himself as the one who can <i>donate</i> a<i> </i>response to his own
epiphany.� Before I can question the Other, the Other�s alterity has already
thrown my sovereign interiority into question.� </p>


<p  > Just
as the Other transcends my vision, he also lies beyond my possession.� Levinas
explains, �The expression the visage introduces into the world does not defy
the feebleness of my powers, but my power for power [mon pouvoir de pouvoir.]�<a
href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[45]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The Other does not transcend me because he exists as an immense and immobile object,
but rather because I can not even begin to relate to him through a horizon of
power.� Levinas states that the face-to-face eliminates my �pouvoir de
pouvoir.�� He seems to use this phrase to critique Heidegger�s analysis of
Dasein as the projection of possibilities.� This French word �pouvoir� connotes
both �power� and �ability.�� Therefore, the deterioration of my power for power
also destroys my ability to be able, my capacity to seize possibilities.<a

Levinas explains that I can exert power only over objects which I grasp in the
sensible world.� Although the visage of the Other does manifest itself as a
sensible phenomenon, his transcendent exteriority to my world and present
moment render him intangible.� Therefore, I can not convert the Other into a
possession; I can only attempt to murder him.� Levinas explains, �To kill is
not to dominate but to annihilate;� it is to renounce comprehension
absolutely.� Murder exercises a power over what escapes power.� It is still a
power, for the visage expresses itself in the sensible, but already impotency,
because the visage rends the sensible.�<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"

I can destroy only the sensible aspect of the Other, his body, but I can not
touch the alterity of his visage.�� Unlike the grasp, homicide does not convert
the Other into something which can be possessed.� The murderer is left with
only a mute corpse.� Levinas discussion of murder does not refer to only the
concrete, physical act of homicide.� Levinas definition of murder<a

to be related to the Jewish conception of gossip as <i>loshon ha-ra</i>�
[literally, �the evil language.�]� Traditionally, Judaism has condemned loshon
ha-ra because, in it, one speaks ill of another human being without giving this
person the opportunity to speak up for himself.� Levinas finds the Greek
correlate to this Jewish prohibition in the Platonic condemnation of rhetoric.�
He states, �Rhetoric, absent from no discourse, and which philosophical
discourse seeks to overcome, resists discourse.� ... It approaches the Other
not to face him, but obliquely � not, to be sure, as a thing, since rhetoric
remains conversation, and across all its artifices goes unto the Other,
solicits his yes ... It is for this that it is preeminently violence, that is,
injustice.�<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span

I, through the rhetoric of my speech, impose my will upon the Other who has
silenced herself in order to listen to me.� For Levinas, �murder� seems to
refer to the attempt to understand someone as if he were dead, in the third
person, to reduce this person to the conception one has of him without allowing
him to defend himself.� Murder forces the transcendent freedom of the Other
into a mute compliance.� Levinas states that this exceptional possibility of
murder is also the �most banal incident of human history.�<a href="#_ftn50"
name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

our discussion, I understand the Other according to the image he presents and
the word he donates.� By doing so, I murder the Other <i>at every present
moment</i> of our conversation.� This murder reduces the life of a human being
to a mere �historical event.�� However, the Other can overcome this violence of
its death through his rebirth in a future moment in which he can defend
himself.� </p>


<p  > The
recurrent act of murder demonstrates the limit of my power to possess
exteriority.� The ethical impossibility of grasping the Other�s alterity and
reducing it to interiority paralyzes my power, putting my mastery over reality
into question.� Instead, the Other, as destitute, exercises her mastery over
me.� Levinas explains, �The nakedness of the visage is destituteness.� To
recognize the Other is to recognize a hunger.� To recognize the Other is to
give,� But it is to give to the master, to the lord, to him who approaches as
�You� [�Vous�] in a dimension of height.�<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[51]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
I perceive the Other as destitute from the perspective of my sovereign
interiority.� Because I have established a domicile which securely houses my
possessions and my consciousness, I view the Other as a completely dispossessed
stranger with respect to this home.� The Other�s presence reveals itself as an
absence within the world I have created for myself.� Levinas describes this
estrangement as a nudity.� Because the Other reveals himself as exterior to my
consciousness, she enters into my realm without any concept protecting or
covering her.� The utterly straightforward relationship directly exposes the
Other to my hospitality and my violence.� Paradoxically, this very destitution
establishes the Other�s mastery over me.� Viewing the Other shows me a being
whose existence lies beyond the horizons of my own sovereign interiority, something
which can not be encompassed within or thematized by my consciousness.� </p>


<p  > The
Other masters me by staring at me and calling my sovereign interiority into
question.� Levinas explains that the visage of the Other views my world from an
external perspective, making me feel ashamed of my quest to dominate the world
as my property.� He states, �The Other measures me with a gaze incomparable to
the gaze by which I discover him ... The relationship with the Other does not
move (as does cognition) into enjoyment and possession, into freedom; the Other
imposes himself as an exigency that dominates this freedom, and hence as more
primordial than everything that takes place in me.�<a href="#_ftn52"

The shame which the Other provokes in me requires me to reflect upon my own
possessiveness, enabling me to achieve self-consciousness.� In this description
of the Other�s mastery over me and of the development of self-consciousness,
Levinas seems to adapt Hegel�s analysis of the interaction between the slave
and bondsman.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[53]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Like Hegel, Levinas asserts that, in order to see oneself, one must look at
someone else who is regarding oneself.� However, Levinas departs from Hegel by
explaining the mastery of the Other as a teaching rather than a domination.�
Whereas I maintain my own self-subsistence by containing the world through my
grasp and my representational vision, the Other teaches me by showing me
something I could never deduce from or absorb within myself.� By exposing his
own exteriority, the Other teaches me that a world exists beyond the narrow
confines of my insular interiority.� The Other teaches me the idea of infinity
by inserting within my consciousness something which I could never contain by
my own power.� Finally, the gaze of the Other�s visage masters and teaches me
by obliging me to respond to him.� </p>


<p  > In
order to understand fully the Other�s mastery over me, it is necessary to
explore what exactly constitutes her destitute absence from my world.� I
perceive the Other as an absence because I have excluded the Other from the
home I have created for my autochthonous existence.� I had established this
interiority by extracting myself as an individual from impersonal totalizing
structures.� By building the barriers of my domicile, I do not merely lock out
the Other; I slam the door on the rest of humanity.� The interiority of my
inner realm refuses the public sphere<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[54]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�by
separating myself from the impersonal, general realm of the third party.�
Therefore, the destitution of the Other refers to the presence of humanity, of
all of the Others, in the visage of the singular Other.� Levinas asserts, �The
third party looks at me in the eyes of the Other � language is justice.� It is
not that there first would be the visage, and then the being it manifests or
expresses would concern himself with justice;� the epiphany of the visage qua
visage opens humanity.�<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[55]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Not only does the Other call me into question, the Other makes me responsible
to everyone.</p>


<p  > The
presence of the third party in the visage of the Other instills a level of
equality within the face-to-face relationship.� Levinas states that �[The
Other�s] equality within this essential poverty consists in referring to the <i>third
party</i>, thus present at the encounter, whom in the midst of his destitution
of the Other already serves.� Because the visage of the Other refers to the
generality of humanity, its mastery also refers to me as an equal.�<a
href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[56]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The emergence of equality from the relationship with the transcendent Other can
be interpreted in several overlapping ways.� First of all, the third party
seems to appear as the sensible aspect of the Other.� Levinas explains that, in
the discursive exchange between the Other and me, �the visage that looks at it
places itself in the full light of the public order.�<a href="#_ftn57"
name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[57]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
our conversation, I present an image and donate a word to the Other.� I do not
sacrifice my interiority, but rather give the Other a general thing which can
be accessed by anyone.� By questioning my right to possess the world in my
private interiority, the Other refers me to the public world of properties.<a
href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[58]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Not only does the Other accuse me as a property owner, the Other manifests
himself in a public light as one constituted by representable properties, as
one who is equal to me in his rights to own public property.� My perception of
myself as an equal also seems to be the effect of a play of perspectives.�
Levinas asserts that I see the masterful Other already serving.� Most
obviously, the Other�s servitude arises from her subjection to the public world
of property.� The Other seems to see me as an Other and therefore also sees
Others in my visage which command him to do justice to everyone.� Furthermore,
it would seem that the Other serves because the Other perceives me as his Other
and therefore views me as his master.� Because I already approach the Other as
a master, I perceive the Other�s servitude as referring back to the generality
of humanity.� </p>


<p  > The
perception of the Other�s transcendent servitude invests me with my sovereign
freedom.� The Other�s destitution masters me by teaching me her poverty and
exteriority.� However, the Other does not master me in order to make me
servile, but rather to make me into a master.� The gaze of the Other invests me
as a unique individual who has the power to administer to the needs of the Other
and the full responsibility to promote social justice.� Levinas explains that
�[The Other] joins me to himself for service.� He commands me as a master.�
This command can concern me only inasmuch as I am master myself;� consequently
this command commands me to command.�<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[59]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The notion that the command of the Other orders me to master myself seems to be
directed against the Kantian model of autonomy as a self-given law.� More
importantly, this statement seems to be directed against Heidegger�s
Nietzschean tendencies.� In <u>Being and Time</u>, Heidegger, following
Nietzsche who himself follows the Stoics, embraces the model of Dasein as one
who resolutely masters its subjection to its heritage through an authentic
projection of its potentiality-for-Being.�� In his 1936 lecture course on <u>Nietzsche:�
The Will to Power as Art</u>, Heidegger projects his concept of resoluteness
onto Nietzsche, stating, �[Willing] is the submission of ourselves to our own
command, and the resoluteness of such self-command.�<a href="#_ftn60"
name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[60]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas� assertion that the Other founds my self-mastery continues a critique
against Heidegger and Nietzsche which Levinas began in his 1934 essay
�Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism.�� In this essay, Levinas
distinguishes between two notions of mastery.� He explains that European
thought defines truth through the notion of universality.� Because an idea can
be detached from the person who proposes it and can be accepted by anyone, a
universal community of equals can all become masters of a true idea.� Even as early
as 1934, Levinas had already begun to explain mastery as an intellectual
mastery, as a teaching of public truths which founds a general community of
masters.� Conversely, Levinas explains that the German ideal, shared by
Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the Nazis, analyzes sovereignty and truth in terms of
a will to power.� They view mastery as a force located within the body of the
one who has force.� In this model, power does not separate from the one who
exerts it nor can it be appropriated by those who are subjected to it.<a
href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[61]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Instead of creating a community of equals, force establishes a world of
forceful masters and subjugated slaves.� This notion of truth as will to power
does not spread through dialogue, but rather universalizes itself through war
and conquest.</p>


<p  > As
mentioned above, Levinas adapts Hegel�s notion that the self requires the gaze
of an Other to achieve self-consciousness.� Levinas states that the face to
face, �this moral experience, so commonplace, indicates a metaphysical
asymmetry:� <i>the radical impossibility of seeing oneself from the outside</i>
and of speaking of the same sense of oneself and of the others, and
consequently the impossibility of totalization.�<a href="#_ftn62"
name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[62]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Because I can never leap outside of myself to observe myself, I require the
perspective of the Other.� Levinas adapts the Cartesian model of the subject�s
relationship with God because, in this confrontation �the Cartesian subject is
given a point of view exterior to itself from which it can apprehend itself.�<a
href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[63]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>��
The visage of the Other forces me to reflect upon myself and to pay attention
to my manifestation.� The epiphany of the Other presents me with a being
outside of the parameters of my own interior existence, a being with his own
independent consciousness.� The Other therefore requires me to establish a
distance between myself and my elemental existence.� By looking at me, the
Other breaks me out of my solipsistic, infantile enjoyment, enabling me to
establish my own powers of possession and vision.� Not only does the face to face
produce my relationship with the world of objects, it also produces my
relationship with myself.� Because the Other questions my sovereign possession
of my interiority, he both authorizes and challenges it.� To invest me with a
responsible freedom, the Other commands me to open up a critical eye to myself,
enabling me to attend to my existence <i>in</i> <i>view of</i> my
possibilities.</p>


<p  > In
this analysis of my self-mastery, Levinas seems to be thematizing the
production of the interior home from an external perspective.� In the pure
state of enjoyment, my existence does not differentiate itself from the
pulsation of the elemental milieu.� Therefore, the impersonal <i>there is</i>
always threatens to swallow up this enjoying I and negate its individuality.�
In order to separate myself from this insular state and from the threat of the
future, I found a home in which I can assert my sovereignty through possession
and representation.� The foundation of the domicile therefore seems to be
equivalent to the self-mastery which the I achieves through its relationship
with the Other�s visage.� Furthermore, Levinas explains that the intimacy with
the feminine Other is the precondition for the home.� He further asserts that
the Other�s manifestation of herself as an absence constitutes her femininity.�
Because Levinas also describes the Other�s masterful destitution as her absence
from my world, one can assume that the welcome of the feminine Other is
equivalent to the command of the destitute Other.� In both cases, the Other is
absenced, is silenced, so that I can posit itself in a masterful moment of
speech.� As will be shown below, Levinas describes the foundation of selfhood
from yet another perspective in his description of the erotic relationship
between the Other and me.</p>


<p  > Levinas
also repeats the analysis of my foundation of my power of visual representation
from an exterior perspective.� Against the Kantian notion of representation,
Levinas explains that visual thematization comes from the intentionality of the
Other rather than my own solipsism.� He states, �Things acquire a rational
signification, and not only one of simple usage, because an other is associated
with my relations with them.� In designating a thing I designate it to the
Other.� The act of designating modifies my relation of enjoyment and possession
with things, places the things in the perspective of the Other.�<a
href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[64]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Because the gaze of the Other puts my enjoyment of the element into question, I
can separate myself from this infantile state.� I can detach myself from the relative
exteriority in order to grasp it as matter.� By questioning my possession of
the world, the visage of the Other detaches me from this matter so that I can
posit it as a set of objects.� The external viewpoint of the Other separates
this matter from my interiority, referring it to a public economy, referring it
to the Other as a donation.� Therefore, Levinas contends that I understand the
world through the mediation of the face-to-face encounter with the Other.�
Whereas Heidegger asserts that Dasein relates to phenomena through its own
comportment, its own hold on Being, Levinas maintains that I establish this
relationship through a vis-a-vis relationship with the visage.� Representation
does not derive from the thematizing work of an isolated ego, but already
depends upon the Other.� The critical light which the autosignifying visage
sheds determines an orientation and a signification for all phenomena.� Through
our rapport, the Other and I reveal a public world of property.� When I speak a
word or present an image, I do so for my interlocutor, the Other.� I enact my
power to represent as welcoming of the Other into my domicile and as donating
my gifts of communication to the Other.� Against Heidegger�s assertion that an
impersonal Being gives [<i>es gibt</i>] a world to Dasein, Levinas contends
that the world is established through the my giving [<i>donner</i>] and the
Other�s pardon [<i>pardonner</i>.]</p>


<p  > Levinas�
analysis of the will demonstrates how even my existence as a for-myself depends
upon the Other.� His analysis of the will enables him to make his most radical
critique of the phenomenological, both Husserlian and Heideggerian, model of
intentionality,� I assert my sovereignty in the public, sensible world through
the exertion of my will.� I evade the threat of the unforeseeable future by
establishing my power in the world.� I create a domicile from which I can
stabilize the world as permanent possessions, to thematize it as objects, and
to communicate messages.� Through its labor, the will produces visible works from
which it absents its interiority.� This production exposes the will�s
sovereignty to outside influences.� For example, the bodily home which
preserves a private space for my interiority also posits me as a public,
visible object.� By willfully asserting myself in the sensible world, I open
myself up to the exploitation of the Other.� Levinas explains, �Every will
separates itself from its work. ... The other can dispossess me of my work,
take it or buy it, and thus direct my behavior;� I am exposed to instigation.�
The work is destined to this alien <i>Sinngebung</i> from the moment of its
origin in me.� It is to be emphasized that this destination of the work to a
history I cannot foresee � for I cannot see it � is inscribed in the very
essence of my power, and does not result from the contingent presence of other
persons alongside of me.�<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[65]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Because I absent myself from the works I create, Others can appropriate these
works and turn them against my original intention.� Although I may initially
project my will, the results of my deeds will be determined by an Other because
they will occur in a future which I can not foresee.� Against Heidegger,
Levinas insists that, due to the very nature of the will, an Other always leaps
in for me.� My existence is never adequate to my intentions because my
intentions are always taken over by an Other.� Every possibility which I
project escapes my own power.� When I donate all of my works to the Other, they
acquire their signification from the Other who receives them.� Because the will
posits its productions in a public, sensible realm, they expose the will to the
Other�s vision.� Although my interiority remains invisible, my labor
externalizes me as a collection of visible products, including my very body.�
In establishing my own sovereign self-consciousness, the will exposes me to the
thematization and objectification of a hostile Other.� </p>


<p  > Levinas
describes this alienation of my will by the Other as war and violence.� Rather
than positing the will as a heroic, self-asserting will-to power, he describes
it as something whose very constitution allows tyrannical violence to force it
into submission.� Through violence, the Other can subjugate the will by
appropriating its products.� Levinas explains, �The part of eternal truth that materialism
involves lies in the fact that the human will can be laid hold of in its works.
... The for itself of the will, unshakable in its happiness is exposed to
violence. ... The will essentially violable harbors treason in its own
essence.� It is not only offendable in its dignity ... but is susceptible of
being coerced and enslaved as a will, becoming a servile soul.�<a href="#_ftn66"

Because the Other can seize the will through its works, he can force it to play
a part in a historical fate which it hasn�t willed.� The existence of the body
articulates the sovereignty and the weakness of the human will.� The body
grounds me as a home from which I can assert power, but it also subjects me to
the subtle coercion and brutal torture of a murderous Other.�� When the will
posits itself as its corporeality, it opens itself up to all of the possible
violence which can be done to a body, to the seduction of gold and to the
brutality of a gas chamber.� Relating to the Other through the public world of
impersonal works and general facts opens up the possibility of war.�� Levinas�
description of violence and war must be read on several different levels.�
First of all, his account of the susceptibility of the will explains how and
why a human being can be degraded through brutality.�� Levinas� account of
persecution denies the reader the opportunity to romanticize the horror of
human suffering.� One could not achieve a similar understanding of the harsh,
material reality of oppression it one utilized a Heideggerian model of a will
which heroically asserts itself against its anxiety.<a href="#_ftn67"

Secondly, Levinas� analysis of violence seems to describe an event in the
conversation between the Other and me.� He describes the Other as a <i>murderous</i>
Other who brings death upon me.� This would seem to suggest that Levinas is
here repeating his analysis of murder from the perspective of one who suffers
from it rather than of one who commits it.� Violence, war, and murder occur to
me at the end of my moment in time.� When I manifest myself in the instant in
my domicile, I externalize a sensible, concrete part of myself.� Just as I can
murder the sensible aspect of the Other, my body becomes general property which
the Other can seize.�� By manifesting myself, I allow the Other to reduce me to
the mere image which I display or the mere word I give.� Because each statement
reduces the humanity of both the Other and me to an impersonal, public thing,
war arises from discourse.� Levinas states, �This discourse is therefore not
the unfolding of a prefabricated internal logic, but the constitution of truth
between thinkers, with all the risks of freedom.�<a href="#_ftn68"
name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[68]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>���
Like Heidegger, Levinas makes struggle into an important phenomenological
category.� However, Heidegger describes struggle as the work of impersonal Being
which draws Daseins together for a common project or as a primordial conflict
between an impersonal Being and its There.� Conversely, for Levinas, struggle
produces this impersonal realm, the violent reductionism of the truth.� War
does not bring people together, but rather occurs between interlocutors who
always maintain their separate freedom from each other, from impersonal forces,
and from the struggle itself.� </p>


<p  > I
suffer when the will of the Other forces me into a state of utter submission.�
Against Heidegger�s analysis of Dasein�s heroically resolute and anxious
Being-towards-Death, Levinas explains suffering as a fear and a fleeing away
from death.� Death is not a state which is my ownmost, but rather a murder
which the Other inflicts upon me.� Levinas explains, �The unforeseeable of
death is due to the fact that it does not lie within any horizon.�� It is not
open to grasp.� It takes me without leaving me the chance I have in a
struggle.� In death I am exposed to absolute violence, to murder in the night.�<a
href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[69]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>���
The language of this statement clearly directs itself against Heidegger�s claim
that authentic Dasein must seize and visually understand death as an authentic
possibility.� In <u>Time and the Other</u>, Levinas explains that death
represents not the possibility of the self�s impossibility, but rather the
impossibility of the self�s possibilities..� Death never lies within my
horizons because, when it arrives, I have already perished.� Instead, the
unforeseeable Other threatens me with something completely beyond my power.� In
suffering, that which completely escapes my power and vision, death, imposes
itself upon me.� This description of suffering again demonstrates the
perspectival character of Levinas� argument.� As was discussed earlier, Levinas
describes suffering as a state which I already overcame and encompassed within
the enjoyment of my needs.� Whereas that account relates my retrospective
perspective at the (re)birth of my instant, Levinas here describes the my
perspective when I look forward to the imminent death of my instant.� Death
occurs when I, having been totally alienated from itself, become swallowed up
by the impersonal totality, the <i>there is</i>, which has been created in the
instant. </p>


<p  > Levinas
explains that the impersonal events of history function as the graveyard for
these slaughtered wills.� He states, �Historiography recounts the way the
survivors appropriate the works of dead wills to themselves;� it rests on the
usurpation carried out by the conquerors, that is, by the survivors; it
recounts enslavement, forgetting the life that struggles against slavery.�<a
href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[70]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Through the impersonal truth of historical knowledge, survivors, people who
live over [<i>sur + vivre</i>] others, appropriate the works of the dead by
thematizing them.� History obscures my invisible interiority by transforming my
existence into something which can be viewed publicly.� It erases my
interiority as someone who acts within history because it does not allow me to
speak up for myself.� History recounts the objective details of my life in a
third-person narrative, forgetting that a human being, an I, actually existed
as these now-impersonal facts.� It describes how, during my death, my will was
manipulated by others while ignoring how, during my recurrent rebirths, I
struggled to reappropriate my sovereignty over my fate.� Although suffering
threatens me with my extermination, it does not totally eradicate my freedom.�
Levinas explains that, in order to make an individual suffer, one must degrade
him as an object while still allowing him just enough freedom to see this
subjugation.� The tiny margin of interior sovereignty which separates me from
my works makes me aware of my suffering and gives me a prevision of the
imminence of my death.� Cognizant of this inevitable violence, consciousness
avoids it.� Levinas explains,� �Things have a dominion over man, but to be a
man is to know that this is so and to desire the postponement of this inhuman
subjection.�<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[71]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
I ultimately escape being reduced to historical data through my vision of the
unforeseeable future which lies beyond the visible present.� The will maintains
its autonomy by detaching itself from the works, words, and images which it
manifests in the instant.� By doing so, I do not remain committed to the
destiny which I project, but rather maintain the capacity to efface the
historical facts of my present moment and to renounce such commitments in a
future moment.</p>


<p  > I
resist the totality of history by reconstituting the invisibility of my
interiority.� Levinas defines invisibility as the offense which totalizing
systems inflict upon individuals by eradicating their particularity. Therefore,
my invisibility can not be <i>represented</i> as a visible event within
history, but rather can only be <i>expressed </i>as my personal communication
to the Other.� I escape death by presenting myself to the Other�s judgment, by
speaking up to the Other in order to request his pardon.�� Levinas explains
this as a fundamentally ambiguous event, �The will, whose spontaneity and
mastery are belied by death, are stifled in a historical context, that is, in
the works that remain of them, of itself seeks to place itself under a
judgment, and to receive the truth from it upon its own witness.� ...� What is
this existence the will enters into, placing itself under a judgment that
dominates the apology, but does not reduce it to silence? ... The will seeks
judgment in order to be confirmed against death, whereas death taken as the
judgment of history kills the will qua will.�<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[72]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
This account of judgment demonstrates how truth becomes constituted by
struggle.� In order to defend itself from being reduced to a historical datum,
the will speaks to the Other, justifying itself as an individual which can
speak for itself.� However, by presenting itself to the Other as its
justification, the will allows the Other to reduce it to the words which it
speaks.� Yet I escapes this reduction by maintaining a conversation with the
Other.� I apologize<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[73]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�to
the Other, speak to his transcendence, and the Other grants me a pardon,
listening to me and allowing me to defend myself by becoming reborn in a new
moment of speech.� I retain the invisibility of my own individuality through my
intercourse with the Other.� Because I can not gaze at my own particularity
from the outside, I must look at the Other who gazes back at me to reconstitute
my own interiority.� </p>


<p  > I
can not distinguish myself from a totality without viewing the gaze of the
Other which maintains a conversation with me and which allows me to speak.� The
destitution of the Other expresses to me the offense which impersonal, visible
history inflicts upon the invisibility of particularity.� Levinas states, �The
invisible offense that results from the judgment of history, a judgment of the
visible, will attest subjectivity to be prior to judgment or to be a refusal of
judgment;� if it is only produced as cry and protestation, if it is felt within
me.� But it is produced as judgment itself when it looks at me and accuses me
in the visage of the Other ... The will is under the judgment of God when its
fear of death is inverted into fear of committing murder.�<a href="#_ftn74"
name="_ftnref74" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[74]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� My
interiority is preserved by the accusation and the pardon of the Other.� By
accusing me of murder, the visage of the Other questions my imperialistic
possessiveness, wrenching me free of the world of impersonal properties and
enabling me to transcend the objectification of history.� Levinas states that
the Other who judges me does so as God who �does not silence by its majesty the
voice and the revolt of the apology.� God sees the invisible and sees without
being seen.�<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[75]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas description of God as the one who �sees without being seen� clearly
refers back to his discussions of Gyges.� The transcendent Other which judges
does so as a sovereign exteriority who always remains free from totalizing
history.� Although the Other�s gaze does murder my sensible aspect by reducing
me to my visible works, it does not turn me into a possession, into an object.�
The Other�s visage recognizes me as an interlocutor, pardoning me as a
sovereign, invisible interiority which always maintains the right to answer and
apologize for itself, and which, through a rebirth, can overcome its visible
historical manifestation.</p>


<p  > I
overcome the death which the Other thrusts upon me by paradoxically willing the
death of my own present moment.� I expose myself to the murderous Other�s
alienation of my will and my works.� I let the Other freeze and objectify my
instantaneous image so that I can escape into an unforeseeable future.� I cease
to resist the Other�s violent appropriation, letting the very center of my
existence be wrenched out of myself.� By accepting this passively and by
maintaining my distance from this violence, I transform my suffering into a
patient awaiting<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;

font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[76]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�of
the future.� Levinas explains, �The situation where the consciousness deprived
of all freedom of movement maintains a minimal distance from the present,� this
ultimate passivity which nonetheless turns into action and into hope, is <i>patience</i>
� the passivity of undergoing, and yet mastery itself.���� I potlatch myself
patiently, refusing not only my attachment to the property I possesses, but
even to the very body which I inhabit.� I will the abdication of my own will,
allowing myself to become radically vulnerable and submissive.� This death
allows me to become reborn as a new mastery, a mastery which will remember this
suffering in the rapture of its enjoyment.</p>


<p  > I
effect my relationship with the unforeseeable future through my erotic
relationship with the Other.� In the erotic relationship, the Other and I
ignore the public sphere in order to enter an intimate relationship with each
other.� For Levinas, eros seems to signify the event in which I absent myself
from historical works to encounter the feminine Other in her absence.� Levinas�
descriptions seem to imply that I encounter the erotic Other at the point of
both of our deaths.� At this point, the Other�s will has been totally converted
into sensible matter.� Unlike the Other in its aspect as an interlocutor, the
Other which has succumbed to this state of ultramateriality does not speak to
me.� However, this husk of the Other does not merely appear a mute object;� her
overwhelming corpse testifies to an alterity which has totally absented itself
from her manifestation.� In this epiphany, I confront the unforeseeable future
as well as death.� This clandestine relationship of our absent interiorities
drastically alters the nature of our specular face-to-face.� As discussed
before, I illuminate a world for myself through the labor which stabilizes the
element as matter.� However, Levinas explains that the Beloved lies beyond my
power:� she can not be grasped, only caressed.� �The caress consists in seizing
upon nothing, in soliciting what ceaselessly escapes its form toward a future
never future enough, in soliciting what slips away as though it <i>were not yet</i>...�
It <i>searches</i>, it forages.� It is not an intentionality of disclosure but
of search:� a movement unto the invisible.�<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[77]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
In the caress, I attempt to touch the Other in her absence, searching after the
invisible privacy of her alterity.� Throughout our conversation, the Other
remains transcendent because, during every moment that he expresses itself, she
refuses to completely reveal herself, thus retaining the capacity to express
something completely new in the unforeseeable future. Unlike Dasein�s
anticipation which foresees and grasps possibilities, my caress has no horizon
within which I can take hold of the future inserted into the present, the <i>not
yet</i>.� Instead the Lover ceaseless gropes after its Beloved, searching for
something which, by definition, dissolves into nothing.� Levinas explains how
this search disrupts my power of vision.� �<i>The essentially hidden throws
itself toward the light, without becoming signification</i>..�<a href="#_ftn78"
name="_ftnref78" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[78]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� He
continues, �To discover here means to violate, rather than disclose a secret
... The shame of profanation lowers the eyes that should have scrutinized the
uncovered.� <i>An intentionality without vision</i>, discovery does not shed
light:� what it discovers does not present itself as <i>signification</i> and
illuminates no horizon.� The visage of the beloved ... expresses only the
refusal to express.� <a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[79]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Levinas states that the lover profanes her secrecy by expressing the fact that
she possesses a secret which she will not express.� This secret can not signify
anything for me because signification depends upon a present Other who can
speak for himself.� Like the Black Monolith in Stanley Kubrik�s <i>2,001</i>,
the epiphany of the lover exposes the existence of a mystery without giving
even a hint about its solution.� Her mortality indicates that <i>something</i>
lies beyond death, but I have no idea what this might be.� Eros reveals
violently by exposing me to the epiphany of the Other�s absence, tearing from
her the thing which she conceals entirely from the visible horizon, the privacy
of her alterity.� However, I do not relate this to a meaningful light.� The
Beloved�s exposure does not disclose her as a thematizable object, but rather
exhibits the very fact that her unforeseeable mystery, her presence as an
absent futurity in the present, can not be penetrated by sight.� Whereas
Heidegger�s Dasein bravely stares into nothingness, into its guilt of
not-being-the-basis-of-itself, Levinas� �I� lowers its eyes shamefully at its
lover�s profanation.� </p>

<p  > </p>

<p  > Levinas�
description of eros seems to indicate that my intercourse with the Other makes
copulation impossible.� Against all neo-Platonic or mystical descriptions of
love, he insists upon the impossibility of a union with the beloved.<a
href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[80]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>� In
the intimacy of love, as in the opposition of war, the Other maintains her
transcendent alterity, remaining outside of my horizons and preventing any
dialectical fusion.� The mystical notion of truth has heavily influenced
traditional Western models of truth and of Being.� Levinas� critique of
copulation also seems to demonstrate that the copula is impossible.<a
href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[81]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Always maintaining absolute separation, my relationship with the Other occurs
neither as a logical joining of subject and predicate nor as a gathering� of
Dasein and Being.� Whereas most traditional philosophy presents truth as
something clean and clear, Levinas references to �ultramateriality� and a
�sublime materiality� seem to imply that the taint of materiality always weighs
down its production.� Levinas seems to suggest that, although impersonal truths
are produced from the sensible, historical corpses of the Other and me, this
very materiality prevents them from being completely melded into a meaningful
truth.� Levinas refers to the Other as the signifier because he signifies his
own alterity in a sensible word that both expresses him and kills him.� The
signifier can not be reduced to a pure meaning because, having his own
irreducible materiality, his embodiment resists assimilation into a systematic
totality.� Similarly, the true sentence which I utter to speak up against
history in defense of my own interiority is produced as a death sentence, but
the stench of my corpse<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[82]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�prevents
an impersonal public truth from erasing me.� Furthermore, this corpse which
haunts truth is produced as an exquisite corpse:� the smell of death is
produced as the pungency of the beloved, the body which is excreted<a
href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Palatino;
position:relative;top:0pt'>[83]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�is
produced as the embodiment of a child.� </p>


<p  > The
materiality congealed in death becomes reborn as a new moment of sensuous
pleasure, a residue which prevents any fusion between the lover and the
Beloved.� Levinas� narrative of my suffering and death and his description of
the erotic relationship with the Other seem to flesh out his analysis of the
newly-born enjoying I from a new perspective.� Just as imminence of death
causes me to suffer, Levinas states that the enjoying I feels insecurity at the
<i>there is</i> which threatens to invade it from the unforeseeable future.� In
order to forestall this threat, I separate myself by putting up the barriers of
my home.� This separation from the element echoes my detachment from the world
of impersonal works.� Just as I submerge myself in the element, the effeminized
Lover loses herself in her compassionate rapport with her Beloved.� Levinas
explains that, like the enjoying I, the erotic I becomes both master and slave,
possessing the Other in so far as I am possessed by the Other.� Just as the
enjoying I derives happiness from my past suffering, the extreme passivity of
the erotic I transforms my suffering into passion of voluptuosity.� �Wholly
passion, it is compassion for the passivity, the suffering, the evanescence of
the tender.� It dies with this death and suffers with this suffering. Being
moved, suffering without suffering, it is consoled already, complacent in its
suffering.� Being moved is a pity that is complacent, a pleasure, a suffering
transformed into happiness� voluptuosity.�<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[84]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Lastly, the absence of the Other in my erotic intimacy seems to correlate with
the absent feminine intimacy which enables me to establish an interior
domicile.� Given the similarity of these descriptions, it seems that, for
Levinas, eros acts as the womb, �the tranquil eternity of its seminal or uterine
existence,�<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[85]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
for the birth of a new me.� </p>


<p  > I
ultimately escape death through my fecund reproduction of a new interiority.�
From the erotic relationship emerges a son who recommences my existence yet
exists apart from me.� My death in the moment transforms into a rebirth of an
Other who inhabits a new moment.� I relate to my futurity through a son who is
both different than and the same as me.<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
position:relative;top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span
>[86]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Unlike the Heideggerian future which Dasein seizes and sees, the birth of the
son lies beyond my vision and grasp.� I neither exert a power over nor project
the son because he leads an existence separate from mine.� Similarly, the son
emerges from a futural world that lies beyond my power of vision.� The
production of the son therefore marks the end of my character as a virile
subject of knowledge and power.� In addition to bringing out the feminine
aspect of the Other, the erotic encounter also effeminizes me.� The Lover does
not exert his selfhood through a masculine projection of its ownmost Being, but
rather she is moved by the pull of the future.� Rather than thrusting myself
towards the future, the erotic relationship initiates me into it.� Reproduction
therefore enables me to escape the closed circle of my own identity.�� Levinas
critiques Heidegger�s notion of destiny because it makes resolute Dasein both
the master and the slave of fate.� By rejuvenating myself as a son, I do not
have to remain committed to the intentions which I had willed and which had
been taken over by Others.� The son who is both the same and Other than me can
reappropriate that which its father had created, overcome the image which he
had manifested, and answer for the words which he had spoken.� Most
importantly, the reborn I possesses the power to renounce my past, to repent
for my deeds, and to apologize to the Other. </p>

existential problematics.� Indeed, there has been a great deal of intercourse
between existentialist thinkers and students of mysticism.� For example, Henri
Corbin, best known for his work on Sufism, was the first writer to translate
sections of <u>Being and Time</u> into French.� This connection between
modernism and mysticism also raises the question of whether any rapport exists
between Levinas and the kabbalist Isaac Luria.� What could the relationship be
between Levinas� idea of the infinite and the Lurianic notion of the emanation
of the Godhead?� Could Levinas� analysis of the absencing of the Other which
gives birth to a domiciled self be modeled on Luria�s doctrine that God absents
himself from the world to allow for man�s existence?� I would claim that Luria
acts as the foundational modern thinker for Judaism, determining Jewish
modernism in the same way that Luther determined Christian modernism.� If this
statement can be accepted, then is it possible that Levinas consciously
reappropriates the thought of this seminal modernist in the same way that he
reappropriates Descartes?</span></p>

>� Another important axis for this discussion lies in
Marcuse�s powerful condemnation of Heidegger, �You write that everything that I
say about the extermination of the Jews applies just as much to the Allies, if
instead of �Jews� one were to insert �East Germans�� With this sentence don�t
you stand outside of the dimension in which a conversation between men is even
possible � outside of Logos.� For only outside of the dimension of logic is it
possible to explain, to relativize, to �comprehend� a crime by saying that
others would have done the same thing.�� (<u>The Heidegger Controversy</u>, p.
164)� How does this remark refract upon Levinas� analysis that the face-to-face
conversation with the Other bears witness to the incomprehensible,
untotalizable suffering of the transcendental Other?� Does Heidegger remain
ignorant of this infinite dimension of suffering precisely because he can not
think properly of the logos as communication between Daseins, but only as the
gathering principle of Being?</span></p>

>�Because Levinas opposes the notion of a neutral
Being, he often discusses the Other as having a certain gender. Therefore, I
will utilize the term �it� only when an overview of the total existence of the
Other is presented.� In this case, I will use female pronouns to describe the
Other as the one who listens and male pronouns to describe the Other as the one
who speaks.� Levinas rarely speaks of the I in terms of its sex.� However, he
refers to me as being �engendered,� that is, being born as a son.� As will be
shown later in this paper, I become feminine in my intercourse with the Other.�

>� By making this statement, I would like to raise the
question of which philosopher can be regarded as the �true heir� of Nietzsche�s
legacy.� The notion of a true heir is, of course, problematic, especially for a
fecund thinker such as Nietzsche.� It has been said that every philosopher has
his or her own reading of Nietzsche.� Nevertheless, it seems fruitful to
compare Nietzsche�s influence on Heidegger and Levinas. Throughout his work, Heidegger
seems to suggest that he somehow carries the thought of Nietzsche to its
logical conclusion.� Indeed, it seems that Heidegger has been privileged as a
reader of Nietzsche:� throughout the 1980s, the composite phrase
�Nietzschean-Heideggerian� was widely used to describe, for example,
hermeneutics and deconstruction.� [In the 1990s, however, Derrida and his
readers have drawn attention to Levinas� influence on deconstruction.]� For me,
however, Heidegger�s texts has always seemed like readings of Nietzsche which
have deleted the joy, the pleasure, and the humor� of the Nietzschean text.�
This sentiment seems to be borne out by Heidegger�s erasure of the Dionysian
aspects of Nietzsche�s thought in his Nietzsche lectures.� Could a Jew succeed
where a Greek never could in reappropriating the reflections of Nietzsche?� By
embracing notions such as recurrence and enjoyment, could Levinas be answering
and continuing Nietzsche�s questions regarding morality?� It seems that the key
text for this comparison would be, as before, <u>Beyond Good and Evil</u>, p.
185.</span></p>

>� As will be discussion below, the femininity of the
Other refers to several features of the self�s relationship to the Other.�
Levinas describes femininity as the �withdrawal and absence� of the Other.�
This seems to refer to:� 1.� the Other as the mother of the newly birthed I;�
2.� the Other as the one who accommodates me, listens to me, and accepts my
gifts [my words];� 3.� the Other as the recipient of my erotic Desire; 4. the
Other as the one who hides herself in her interiority from manifesting itself
in the present; and� 5. The Other as the self�s wife.� This �marriage�
signifies that I have gone beyond my infantilism and have become a man.�
Although each aspect of the Other�s femininity can be viewed separately, all of
these coincide in the Other�s manifestation and harmonize with the male
attributes of the Other.� Finally, it should be noted that, at certain times in
our relationship and from certain perspectives, I take upon these feminine
traits in relation to the Other.</span></p>

thrown into a perplexity, became aware of his ignorance, and felt a desire to

>� Levinas connects the Other�s absence to both the
femininity of the Other and to the presence of the public realm in the Other.�
Therefore, it seems that Levinas transitively relates femininity with the
public world.� This correlation seems quite important for male modernists.
Whereas traditional societies tend to model the home as a feminine realm and
the realm of public exchange as masculine, Nietzsche continually warns of the
effemination caused by the mob mentality.�� Heidegger, in <u>Introduction to
Metaphysics</u> critiques Russia and America for bringing about the <i>Entmachtung
</i>�of the spirit.� Although this term might be translated more accurately as
�disempowerment� (Derrida translates it as �destitution,�) Manheim suggestively
translates it as �emasculation.�� Also, Heidegger�s reference to the �pincers�
of mass culture which trap Germany can also be taken as a metaphor of
castration.</span></p>

French term �propre� can be used against the German term �Eigen.�� �Property�

power;� 2.� �Property� connotes my sojourn in the home as economic as well as

<p  > In
this conclusion, I would like to take up Robert Gibbs� challenge to consider
possible relationships between Marx and Levinas though a rereading of this
thesis.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[1]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
The trajectory from Descartes to Levinas charts a profound transformation in
man�s consumer relationship to a developing commodity economy.� Descartes
writes at a period which marks the beginning not only of modern thought, but
also of bourgeois capitalism.� Descartes� description of himself figures him as
almost the paradigmatic bourgeois consumer.� Descartes sits down at his desk,
calm and clear-headed, relaxing in the complacency of his home, to write his <u>Meditations
on First Philosophy</u>.� From this space of comfort, Descartes looks out at a
threatening world filled with possible uncertainty and insecurity.� In
response, he attempts to preserve this security by domesticating exteriority.�
Descartes masters the external world by positing it as a set of objects which
offer themselves to him for his contemplation.� He does not figure his
consciousness as a <i>tabula rasa</i>, reacting to new, unexpected sense-data.�
Rather, Descartes sets a table for himself with morsels which offer themselves
for his consumption and domination. </p>


<p  > Nietzsche�s
and Heidegger�s works express their distrust and disdain of this consumerist
position.�� Both of them warn that Descartes� spectatorial paradigm constitutes
a cowardly retreat from life and its contingencies.�� Heidegger explains that
mass culture submerges and loses Dasein by transforming its authentic
possibilities into exchangeable and consumable commodities.� Nietzsche contends
that society effeminizes the individual, making him unable to assert his
sovereign will-to-power.� Both of them overcome their anxiety over modern
economic circumstances by developing an anxiety over an underlying abyss.� They
assert that, by confronting the limits of one�s own existence, one can find
one�s will to take risks, no matter what outcome fate may destine.� In response
to the flaccidity and passivity of modern selfhood, Nietzsche and Heidegger
affirm the importance of creative, heroic individuals, of tragic artists and
poetic builders.� By doing so, both of them try to oppose the dominant consumerist
subjectivity with a productive subjectivity.� Nietzsche�s argues that the self
should assert its will to power by producing new perspectives and creating new
poetic visions.� By developing a concept of possibility which can not be
reduced to actuality, Heidegger establishes a process of perpetual production
which can not be reduced simply to the commodities it produces.� Furthermore,
Heidegger�s Dasein confronts its world as entity which it can manipulate to
promote its own possibilities like the solitary capitalist entrepreneur who
exploits reality in the name of free enterprise.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

</p>


<p  > Before
discussing how Levinas� works relate to consumer capitalism, I would like to
meditate on what his work describes.� Although Levinas is an ethical thinker,
we must be precise about what this term means for him.� Levinas is not a
thinker of morals or virtues.�� He does not � at least, not explicitly �
prescribe any specific behaviors or attitudes.� Furthermore, he does not
furnish us with the equivalent of a Kantian imperatives; he does not give us
ground rules for moral laws.� Instead, I would argue that Levinas� project in <u>Totality
and Infinity</u> is quite similar to Heidegger�s project of constructing a
ontological phenomenology in <u>Being and Time</u>.� Although the terminology
often seems cryptic and the sentences often become dizzying, Levinas intends to
describe the exact structures of our everyday empirical existence.� </p>


<p  > Levinas�
philosophy attempts to radically reorient my conception of my life.� Rather
than letting me think of myself as an independent, autonomous entity, Levinas
wrenches the center of my life outside of myself.� Levinas teaches me just how
radically I, at every moment of my life, am radically exposed to the wills of
other people.� The Other always maintains the capacity to shock me in both
delightful and horrifying ways.� My openness to the Other explains why I can
not shut out another person�s suffering, even if I choose to ignore it.�
Conversely, this exposure also enables another person to invade my privacy in
order to harm me.� By orienting me towards ethics, Levinas does not necessarily
make me act �better� in the conventional sense.� Rather, he demonstrates how my
interactions with others � and even my relationship with myself as one who
transubstantiates into an Other over time � will always disrupt my
self-assertive will.�� The Other confronts me as a person whose actions I can�t
fully predict and whose statements I can�t completely control, yet whose
commitments and words directly affect me.� Furthermore, the Other seizes my
destiny away from myself because he always takes over my projects and my works
at the very moment that I project and produce them.�� Therefore, Levinas
demonstrates that, in this post modern age of The Rapture, control will always
slip out of our grasp and our will will always be violated by others.</p>


<p  > Like
Marx, Levinas� works meditate on the irreducible materiality of the human
condition and on the need for economic justice.� <u>Totality and Infinity</u>
always brings the reader back to a contemplation of the incarnate nature of
existence, showing how our transformations from one moment to another are
always resurrections of the <i>flesh</i>.�� Furthermore, this book always makes
me contemplate how my discourse, my <i>commerce,</i> with others always occurs
through the economic relationships I establish with them and with myself.� In
his discussions of enjoyment, Levinas consistently praises Marx for recognizing
the fundamental sincerity of man�s material desires.� Describing life as
alimentation, as eating, Levinas� analysis of enjoyment grounds my existence in
my consumerism.� Rather than viewing the world as possibilities I can seize, I
ground my existence on my sensual enjoyment of the objects I consume.� Levinas
cites Theophile Gautier�s assertion, �I am one of those people for whom the
external world exists.�<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[3]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
He does not figure my life as a heroic one, but rather describes me as more of
a dandy, as effeminate, indulging myself in the element.�� </p>


<p  > Levinas�
ideas can be applied to think through concrete phenomena which we encounter in
our contemporary consumerist economy.� For example, Levinas explains that the
Other retains his transcendence through his infinite capacity to clarify the
image he presents.� Although he may manifest a particular facade at one moment,
the Other can always present a completely different one in a new moment.� The
infinity of temporality allows the Other to create himself anew in a form which
I never could have anticipated.� This description, I would argue, can give us a
phenomenology of Madonna, the post-modern person <i>par excellance</i>.�
Doesn�t Madonna�s constitute her �identity� precisely on her infinite capacity
to recreate herself from one album to another, from the Boy Toy of <i>Borderline</i>,
to the seductress of <i>Like a Virgin</i>, to the sophisticated vamp of <i>Vogue</i>?�
Similarly, Levinas explains that one establishes oneself in the moment by
positing oneself as a concrete work.� By manifesting oneself in the public
world, one creates oneself as a consumable object.� Again, doesn�t Madonna�s
�power� derive precisely from her infinite ability to exploit herself, her
infinite capacity to control her own commodification? </p>


<p  > More
importantly, Levinas� analysis can also lend itself to a new critique of the
consumerist economy.� The anarchist Raoul Vaneigem, in his <u>Revolution of
Everyday Life</u> critiques consumerism in, as the title suggests, a
Heideggerian manner.� He argues that modern society forces us into a survival
mentality in which we merely consume goods rather exploring and exerting our
creative wills.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;position:relative;
top:0pt'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><sup><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
font-family:Palatino;position:relative;top:0pt'>[4]</span></sup></span></span></sup></span></a>�
Conversely, Levinas can help us to develop an an-archism of the other man.� For
Levinas, survival connotes a literal �living over,� an existence which lives
off of those who have been slaughtered by history.� Levinas explains that the
self�s enjoyment derives through its concretization and incorporation of the
elemental as objects for its bodily consumption.� Furthermore, Levinas explains
that this elemental enjoyment is produced from the materiality of the works it
has inherited from the past, from the human suffering and death which has
congealed itself in the production of a work.� Levinas updates Marx�s analysis
of capitalism as vampirism, Marx�s descriptions of the machinery of production
sucking the life out of the bodies it consumes in production.� He draws our
attention to the fact that, in an era where all dresses are made from the blood
of children and all overcoats are made from human hair, the everyday of
consumption implicates the consumer in profound violence.� </p>


<p  > Perhaps
we can use Levinas to develop a phenomenology of social protest.� The Other
presents me with a being who �burns without being consumed,� whose humanity can
not be fully absorbed by a consumer economy, yet whose epiphany also teaches me
the possibility of a holocaust.� Levinas figures me as someone who is
profoundly aware of human suffering, even if I choose to ignore this
degradation.� Furthermore, in his later works, he repeatedly explains that the
material needs of the Other are my own spiritual needs.� The Other calls me
away from my complacent comfort, demanding that I work to promote social and
economic justice.� Levinas describes ways in which I can confront systems of
oppression.� He explains that my freedom does not derive from my ability to
exert my will, but rather from an awareness that anonymous powers always
threaten to crush my freedom.� Although outside powers can indeed control me
and objectify me, I always maintain the infinite capacity to speak to the
Other.� Like Abraham who argues desperately against God�s destruction of Sodom
and Gomorra, I retain the infinite ability and duty to bear witness to the
suffering of myself and the Other and to speak out against the concrete facts
which oppress us.� </p>
