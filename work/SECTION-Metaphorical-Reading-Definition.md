* Why is a metaphorical reading interesting or important?
*         e)  “Metaphors We Live By”,  George Lakoff
*             i) Use “Metaphors we live by” to demonstrate the existential/phenomenological nature of metaphors
*             ii) Zed must know about an interesting philosophical commentary or I can just stick with the cogsci.  I know it from undergrad.
*             iii) Maybe I can try to say something about Austin and speech acts. “words do things”  I don’t know this stuff.  Ask Zed.
*         f) Derrida, John Llewelyn, Simon Critchley on Levinas and Metaphors
*             i)  Borges is correct: "Perhaps universal history is but the history of several metaphors." Light is only one example of these "several" fundamental "metaphors," but what an example! Who will ever dominate it, who will ever pronounce its meaning without first being pronounced by it? -- Jacques Derrida on Emmanuel Levinas
*             ii) See “Viewing Power”, https://www.waste.org/~roadrunner/writing/thesis.htm
*             iii) Llewelyn/Critchley:  trope of “drama” is actually also trope of familiarity – drama = Greek tragedy = re-ligare, yoked to each other
*         g) Find the quote by Levinas in the 40s about the preposition in Heidegger’s Being (being-with, Being-in, etc)
