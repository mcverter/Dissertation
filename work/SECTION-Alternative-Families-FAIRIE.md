            iii) Radical Faeries
*                 (1) I used to consider myself a queer at various times, 
*                     (a) and was welcomed by great folks like The Murrmonster, Nedula, Liz, Rhani and Danny and Morty into the queer family, and myself
*                     (b) Became a waitress with the 60s acid-head drag queens “The Cockettes”
*                     (c) I became a waitress with the Cockettes free meal, No Penny Opera
*                     (d) 
*                     (e) Weird how I am a dead ringer for my dead mother.  Kind of like Norman Bates but also kind of different.
* 
*                 (2) That said, I no longer call myself “queer” 
*                     (a) because I don’t understand the political commitments of claiming that label
*                     (b) for the sake of simplicity, an attempt to create an identity that covers over all the internal and external variance
*                     (c) I am a basically straight cishet white male
*                     (d) I am according to some standards an effeminate male, perhaps even a “male hysteric”.  At this point I am almost fifty so I no longer care about any criticism of my masculinity.  Like it or lump it
*                     (e) Besides this, “masculinity” is kind of a pain in the ass
*                         (i) Sure I have been called a “faggot” – even suffered a concussion after being smacked down the pavement for looking like one
*                         (ii) But every masculine-defined body has gone through this form of abuse as enforced masculinity
*                         (iii) How much is our culture inundated by various forms of male self-hatred.  
*                         (iv) Talk sympathetically about incels:  men who aren’t masculine enough
*                 (3) Radical Faerie Commune in Tennessee:
*                         (i) Fales Library at NYU
*                         (ii) “Go to Tennessee and find out for yourself”  --Tobaron Waxman
