In this presentation, I intend to follow through with a series of questions that I have been posing for quite a long time now: what can the social vision developed under the rubric of anarchist communism learn from the feminist critique of patrirchy and more generally of the political, specifically what are the resonances between the anarchist ideal of mutual aid and feminist analyses of care ethics and maternal practice.

We already find hints of the anarchist and feminist critique within the foundational texts of patriarchal political philosophy. Aristotle explains in his text of politics political relations are only one of the modalities of existing-in-common. Previous to his analysis of the political as the domain where male citiens emerge into the public sphere as negotiate for power and influence, Aristthe domain of the home as a sphere in which people are as a way in which persons are bound together to support and nurture each other. Alth
However, Aristotle supplements this patriarchal analysis of the household with a secondary definition. The household is not simply the locus of domination, but more fundamentally, it is the association where people come together to attend to their everyday needs and wants, the communal space where people become companions through the activity of eating together (Aristotle, 1996, 1252b12–20).

It is important to note that, even in one of the foundational texts of political philosophy, there are already clues that point towards other possibilities. In the first lines of his treatise on Politics, Aristotle declares that the polis (city-state) is only one among several kinds of human koinon (community), another of which is the oikos (home) (1996, 1251b1ff ). Unfortunately, however, the analysis he offers of the home is the prototypically patriarchal one, a definition that has been influential throughout Western history. Not only does Aristotle claim that the home is encompassed within the state, but he also intersects these two communal spheres in the figure of the patriarch, who establishes his dominion over the domestic sphere through a process of domination and domestication, and who establishes the science of oikonomos (economy) to order the household and to acquire property (1996, 1253b1ff). However, Aristotle supplements this patriarchal analysis of the household with a secondary definition. The household is not simply the locus of domination, but more fundamentally, it is the association where people come together to attend to their everyday needs and wants, the communal space where people become companions through the activity of eating together (Aristotle, 1996, 1252b12–20).

the social vision developed under the rubric of anarchist communism What certain threads of analysis that I some threads I have been following for quite a long time. This presentation is largely a follow up on work I have been doing for quite a long time on the mother as a figure in ethical relationships, and considering how to read variosu anarchist figures as mothering.

Let me first start off, however, by introducing my philosophical backgound, my stance and my stakes in this grond. So I don't entirely understand what it means to identify myself. Not that random flux but is a certain kind of responsibility In a sense, my identity is constituted as a type of response to whatever interpolations are in effect at any given moment. So now that I am standing here before you, I am presenting, within the present a moment, a gift of my presence. As what though. Yes, it all depends on your frame of reference and your vocabulary but in order to commmunicate with the widest community, to respond to their interrogations, I would idenityf myself most particularly as an anarchist, a feminist, an anarchafeminist, anarchocommunist, white, male, jewish, arguably cisgender and heterosexual but under certain circumstances queer. And philosophically most influenced by the 'pataphysical writings of ethical phenomenologist Emmanuel Levinas

The problematic that I have interrogated for many years is the problematic of the family in Levinas. Levinas uses metaphorics of the family to articulate how the Becoming of Being occurs through relatives and strangers. Phenomenological always engaged in a dialogue with science, with the philosophical tradition taken from Kant and Descartes and Newton and Hobbes. How does one thing flow into becoming -- how does one moment follow another? in what way can it be said that i am mitchell, especially because my responsibilities of being mitchell, the responses that make me into mitchell, are shifting according through time according to whatever history and circumstances.

A lot to be said about Levinas and the problems wih the problematics he proposes. Levinas ethical orientation towards the other. However in Levinas, this is articulated. Not a general otherness not the social or the socius as one big monstrous block, but as specific characters, taken from Hebrew bible and Greek bible and tragedy, Shakespeare, paternal family strucutre.

The becoming of Being isn't just a material flux. We get this trajectory in anarchism of the flux. Heraclitus, everything changes. Panta rhei, A mass assemblangoe of thigs driven by affects and so on. Well this is correct in some sense but there are other dynamics besides the mechanical flux of eleemnts, atoms coalescing into molar masses, atoms developing into chemicals and larger assemblages

By focusing on the modes in which we are related to each other, Levinas brings to light two important dynamics alongside the mechanical movement

1. Through metabolic transformations
   Beyond just the mechanical interactios, specifically that we are born of death, that each birth of a moment is already predicated on the death of soething else . mushroom grows from decay. every moment is already a meoment of brithing and dying and the new birth emerges from that decay
2. Through regeneration Regeneration
   A process of birthing. what is it that creates life anew, how does gestation and birth occur wahat sort of relatinship are necessary heare for each moment to follow another.  
   And this here is where we encounter of the mother

Let's talk first about metabolism. We are what we eat. The human body is constituted through what it consumes. But where does this consumption come from. Even if you haven;t read Marx, you shuld know that objects of consumption come from the labor of the laborer whose labor-power created it from raw material -- we will come to the question of material of raw material below. As a power it is a dynamic force, an activity, an expenditure of energy. As such, it takes the life force from the worker, converts it into capital, producing an object, something that be consumed as a use value for a consumer. So our eating is the transformation of the death of something.

Generation of generations. Levinas articulates this as the generation of gendered generations. I have a lot to say about the ambisexuality of gender in Levinas's work but for now let's just start why it is important to him: Levinas thinks through gender to oppose the Neutral character of human analysis -- Being, Society, Totaltiy, just some big Thing, some big bad Object. Generation. Produced by a process of birthing within a family, from characters he presents as "maternal" and "paternal".

Ther is a connection to other people tht isn't voluntary. I can't emphasize how this enough, that the bonds with other peole through family are not chosen and they involve us in all sorts of problematic and unpleasant intrigues that are beyond our choosing and desiring. that we find ourselves responsible to others.

THe paradigmatic example that Levinas uses to illustrate this is cain and abel in the bible. that the question whether the brothers are each other's keepers or not and the stories of greek tragedy are all about the nurturing quality of family.

what the idea of the family offers us is the model of koinon, a relationship that is prepolitical or nonpolitical, that operates through and alongside the familial but is not

The focus on labor is material generally. productive labor. biased in workerism with a patriarchal stance. teh male laborer goign off to work. we see this character in Levinas as the male worker. the married heterosexual male going off to work.

Glazebrook
When we turn to feminist considerations of the nature of birth, we can distinguish a process of temporal becoming that is distinct from an impersonal mechanism that produces life from the metabolic decay of death. Alongside the collision of anonymous
material forces that displace each other to establish their dominance, pregnancy demonstrates how two persons can share the same material substance. As Trish Glazebrook explains, pregnancy provides a biological counterexample to Aristotle’s physical observation that two bodies cannot occupy the same place at the same time. “Pregnancy is a rounding logic of self into other … the presence of one in the self. The
womb … is the first place with which the body finds itself co-structuring.”

Before the beginning of every moment of one’s life, the materiality of one’s body already

my own body.” 6

Kyle Taylor Lucas, an enrolled member of the Tulalip Tribes (USA) and the Nlaka’pamux First Nation (Canada), speaks eloquently on the importance of the Olympia Port Blockade. “This struggle is important because our planet is on fire. As an indigenous woman, I feel a duty to honor my elders and the legacy of my ancestors in caring for this mother earth – and, moreover; I feel a responsibility to my grandchildren and the next seven generations to stand up to the economic machinery propped up by the government, specifically the Port of Olympia, in perpetuating the warming of this planet and the poisoning of water, essential to life. We call ourselves Water Protectors and we were especially inspired by the courageous stand taken at Standing Rock during DAPL. We indigenous peoples came together with our allies here at Olympia Stand to resist the Port of Olympia’s forced complicity in propping up dirty hydraulic fracturing in North Dakota that these proppants support.”
