    I find Alaska especially inspiring
        0:06
    because you walk out in to the woods and
        0:09
    there's a holiness and there's a magic
        0:11
    to the forest that can't be found
        0:13
    anywhere around there's you become
        0:15
    immediately connected to the environment
        0:17
    around you and that is literally
        0:19
    inspiring and if you the word inspiring
        0:21
    means to breathe life into and so you
        0:24
    can walk out into the forest and you can
        0:26
    walk out into the into the glacier
        0:28
    fields and you can be renewed and
        0:30
    restored in spirit and you find a kind
        0:32
    of relation with the world that you
        0:34
    don't find elsewhere oftentimes you you
        0:37
    know the the city urban centers cut you
        0:40
    off your relations with with others and
        0:42
    with the world around you but here it's
        0:44
    it's immediately accessible I'm here
        0:48
    because I'm excited about the student
        0:51
    attitude the curiosity that the students
        0:53
    bring to the classroom because we live
        0:55
    in such a dynamic and beautiful place
        0:57
    it's a very small campus and everybody
        0:59
    gets to know each other and it creates
        1:02
    just a different kind of learning
        1:03
    dynamic it's it seems to be a very
        1:08
    diverse student body and that presents
        1:11
    its own pedagogical challenges but I
        1:13
    think the challenges are precise you
        1:15
    know open up opportunities and so you
        1:18
    learn to negotiate and to read and to
        1:21
    evaluate the different cultural
        1:23
    backgrounds and histories of the
        1:24
    students and its intimate but it's so
        1:27
    diverse and so robust and it really
        1:31
    presents them some wonderful
        1:32
    opportunities you just don't get
        1:33
    anywhere else
