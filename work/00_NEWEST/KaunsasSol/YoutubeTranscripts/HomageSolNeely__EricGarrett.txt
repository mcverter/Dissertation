    two weeks ago exactly we lost a friend a
        1:37
    father husband son teacher activist and
        1:42
    a great lebanoscience dollars Dr Sal
        1:44
    janeeli Saul was a force of nature he
        1:48
    was the epitome of action and kindness
        1:50
    itself
        1:51
    so quipped that when he passed he went
        1:54
    on his Tombstone to be that he was a
        1:56
    verb pure action and that he was
        1:59
    I want to thank the Hansel family and
        2:01
    Sorel for commemorating Sal with your
        2:04
    conference this weekend it is apropos of
        2:06
    the conference theme is the meaning of
        2:08
    the human because Sal was one of the
        2:10
    best humans I ever knew
        2:12
    and a person who always championed the
        2:14
    face of those who are often not seen
        2:17
    uh this reminds me of a Cherokee story
        2:19
    that Saul used to tell about the people
        2:22
    seeing in the earth and even though we
        2:24
    couldn't see their faces we had a
        2:26
    responsibility to care for them
        2:28
    and Saul was that type of caring person
        2:32
    Saul was the co-founder and the first
        2:34
    president of the North American Lebanon
        2:35
    Society
        2:37
    he found his interest in lebanos in
        2:39
    Anchorage Alaska where he earned a ba in
        2:43
    English and philosophy with Dan Klein
        2:44
    who's another lebanosian
        2:48
    um I had the honor to meet Sal in
        2:51
    graduate school at Purdue University
        2:52
    where we took classes together with our
        2:54
    teachers Sandra goodheart who's here in
        2:56
    Martin matustic
        2:58
    Sal wrote an amazing dissertation
        3:01
    revolutionizing Mia woodick's literary
        3:04
    philosophical and political pedagogies
        3:06
    in a time of disaster
        3:07
    and his interests were in pedagogy
        3:10
    literature advocacy and decolonizing in
        3:14
    indigenous studies
        3:16
    Saul is drawn to higher education
        3:18
    because he was just a great teacher who
        3:20
    was concerned with the human face of his
        3:22
    students
        3:23
    this love is one of the things I think
        3:26
    that of teaching is what Drew him to
        3:27
    Lebanon
        3:29
    uh part of Saul's myutex was dedicated
        3:32
    being uh an activist an advocate teacher
        3:37
    inspired you know by the experiences of
        3:39
    one of our teachers he created the
        3:42
    flying University which was a program
        3:44
    that was in The Lemon Creek Correctional
        3:47
    Center in Juneau Alaska where he
        3:49
    did an inside out bringing students into
        3:52
    the prison to educate the prisoners
        3:56
    um he volunteered his time here and
        3:59
    really touched people students said that
        4:01
    he really he literally saved their lives
        4:05
    so I wanted to do this work because he
        4:07
    saw the human and the prisoners when the
        4:09
    state and Society often failed to even
        4:10
    see them as human
        4:12
    Saul did this pedagogical work because
        4:14
    he wanted to reimagine the idea of
        4:17
    Justice into a format that was
        4:19
    restorative
        4:20
    he walked his talk by showing a way to
        4:22
    fundamentally reimagine what Justice
        4:24
    could be
        4:26
    I cannot do justice to the testimonials
        4:29
    that his students from that program and
        4:31
    from his university have offered upon
        4:33
    hearing of Saul's passing
        4:35
    he is no doubt he was an amazing uh
        4:38
    teacher and for the North American
        4:40
    Lebanon Society he always made sure that
        4:42
    pedagogy sessions were Center of all the
        4:45
    work that we did
        4:47
    Saul was also a proud proud member of
        4:50
    the Cherokee Nation
        4:52
    he and his daughter were studying their
        4:54
    language
        4:55
    and translation and indigeneity were
        4:58
    Central themes of his scholarship
        5:01
    in 2020 he moved to Heritage University
        5:04
    a private university on the Yakima
        5:06
    Indian reservation in Washington State
        5:09
    in 2019 he walked the Trail of Tears
        5:13
    from Georgia to Oklahoma with his father
        5:15
    and his daughter
        5:17
    and it was a real honor to have visited
        5:20
    the Cherokee Museum in North Carolina
        5:23
    um with Sal before you know before he
        5:25
    gave one of our Keynotes on at on
        5:28
    levinos displacement and repair
        5:31
    one of Saul's current projects that he
        5:33
    was doing a phenomenology of land
        5:35
    acknowledgment
        5:38
    finally saw was a great lebanosian
        5:41
    he was taught by you know one of our
        5:43
    favorite teachers Sandra goodheart who
        5:45
    he absolutely cherished
        5:47
    and Saul wrote on themes like levinos
        5:50
    and midrash and humor and in Sal was a
        5:54
    bit of a trickster himself
        5:56
    so he the humor was it was always
        5:59
    wonderful it was always something that
        6:00
    smiled that you see there you always
        6:02
    brought in everything he did
        6:04
    he wrote in lebanason language
        6:06
    translation hermeneutics film and
        6:08
    literature
        6:12
    phenomenology as being the linchpin to
        6:16
    his activism and pedagogy that was
        6:18
    because like Sal like Levin assault was
        6:21
    attuned to the face of the other
        6:23
    upon news of his passing a mutual friend
        6:26
    of ours said that Saul was the best of
        6:28
    us and he was right his loss is the
        6:31
    deepest of wounds
        6:34
    one of the last things that Saul wrote
        6:37
    um was the following he said quote
        6:39
    Emmanuel levinos's Association of
        6:41
    inspiration with the literalness of
        6:43
    respiration has been from the first
        6:46
    moment I read it a guiding way for me to
        6:48
    think about balance we breathe into
        6:51
    Vitality we breathe out into exhaustion
        6:53
    that's the honest Cadence of our lives
        6:56
    and to the extent that lebanos's
        6:57
    phenomenology was rooted in the oral
        7:00
    traditions of Judaism his Insight
        7:02
    resonates with indigenous
        7:04
    phenomenologies in Rich ways
        7:07
    our lives are seasonal and moments of
        7:09
    exhaustion open back into inspiration
        7:12
    and I sometimes think the shape of
        7:14
    gratitude is the shape of our lungs on
        7:16
    the inhale end quote
        7:21
    breathe out and inhale and just happy to
        7:26
    have shared the breath
        7:28
    with Saul
        7:29
    and
        7:31
    as George Hansel said that you know he
        7:34
    was the last ethical communist
        7:37
    and he was our friend
        7:40
    and he will be missed
