    saul i would like to start with you if i may uh for folks who haven't seen the documentary tell us about how this got
    How this got started
        2:14
    started okay well um i started teaching in prisons when i was
        2:21
    working on my phd at purdue university in indiana and i really enjoyed it i later on met
        2:27
    somebody from the university of oregon who was teaching courses in prisons it's
        2:32
    called the inside out prison exchange program and what was so unique about that program was that they bring
        2:38
    university students inside the prison for mutual and collaborative study i love that idea and so when i came when
        2:46
    i was hired at uas i began to inquire about how i could get into the prison and teach philosophy and
        2:52
    literature courses um somebody finally put me in touch with educator paul mccarthy in lemon creek
        2:58
    correctional center and he picked it up and ran with it and um in fall 2012 i
        3:06
    taught a special topics class on it was called fugitive thought philosophy and literature born of the
        3:11
    prism and i was able to bring i think about 16 students in that
        3:19
    semester we only had three weeks together as a combined class
        3:24
    of inside students and outside students but the following semester we
        3:29
    were able to pull off six weeks and then the following semester nine weeks and then finally we hit the ten weeks which
        3:36
    is the normal seminar length at this point so okay
        3:42
    nathan i know that you are one of the original members of the flying university uh marcus you are too uh
    First time you met Saul
        3:49
    nathan tell me about the first time you met saul the first time you came to this class
        3:55
    what emotions come to mind what was it like i had known saul prior um
        4:02
    through some friends of ours i met him once or twice i didn't really like the guy
        4:08
    i uh he was canoeing all by himself basically yelling like a pirate
        4:13
    it was a beautiful thing made me realize i needed to go to school but i was working for paul mccarthy in
        4:19
    the library and i heard him talking on the phone and mentioned uh saul's name and i was like
        4:25
    whoa what's going on here he kind of gave me a little gist saying that they were going to have a class a couple weeks later i got fired
        4:33
    i earned it i had gotten very depressed after i got sentenced and just kind of like quit everything but it was a good pickup and
        4:40
    then about three or four weeks after that saul came in for the class and it was just it's just awesome you know just
        4:45
    to see a big old smile on my face his face it's like it's like we were friends the whole time
        4:50
    even though i didn't like him at first marcus how about you
    First time you met Paul
        4:55
    i'm trying to remember i remember because i didn't really like pay attention like the first two weeks of
        5:02
    class i kind of just went um to get off work because i worked in the
        5:08
    kitchen i was like i don't work i'd rather you know i love being in the mods so um i'll go through the motions but paul
        5:16
    got me and um walking down the stairs one time and he because we always used to discuss
        5:21
    literature and paul was like um he's like hey man you're a bright dude and um
        5:27
    i want to do a class and i was like what'd i get
        5:33
    and you know we'd be asked for a little bit and i ended up taking about taking him up on
        5:39
    his offer to do the class um and uh saul walks in and i see this dude
        5:45
    with like this french beret and you know like i don't know what it's called you know i just seen him walk in
        5:50
    i was like who is this posh mother you know and he uh he had a long ponytail and i was
        5:58
    like all right let's see how this goes you know he's probably going to teach us to hug
        6:03
    trees and eat granola and um he uh was great man he blew my mind blew my
        6:10
    mind being able to he did not baby us he started throwing
        6:16
    stuff at us just right away like ethics and infinity and we were reading
        6:21
    nietzsche and we were reading kierkegaard we did a hobble we we did so much and i was like
        6:27
    what are we doing um that it made me like all right i was cocky i was arrogant i thought i
        6:34
    you know was very intelligent when i took his class i was humbled i was like whoa
        6:41
    all right we gotta start from the ground up here so i was hooked after that and um i kept asking them after class um hey you got a
        6:48
    good reading got any good reading and then we ended up clicking and he's like you got to read the sub go to marcos you
        6:53
    got to read this he was asking about more stuff about my culture about the hispanic culture and and especially that
        6:59
    in mexico and he was like you're named after him man you got to read this dude named sabco dante marcos from the
        7:04
    sappatista movements and i get it and i was hooked and i and i met and i learned what it meant to be that brother's keeper what
        7:10
    it truly meant and the rest is history man all that assault you know that's my dude solves my dude
        7:17
    also right when we uh heard about the class paul said that we had to fill out an essay chekhov's the bet
        7:24
    and right away i was like oh wow this guy's serious he really wants us to engage it academically and
        7:30
    that was something i wasn't ready for but once we engaged in the class i think we were all pretty well prepared after a couple weeks to actually start writing
        7:36
    oh yeah that's great just in case folks haven't seen the documentary we have a clip
    Inside the classroom
        7:43
    from inside the classroom with different scenes in the classroom to give our viewers a feeling of what it's like
        7:48
    inside come on in guys
        8:04
    mr alexander yeah good to see you elsie shake your hand again
        8:09
    how's it going
        8:25
    are being recorded and i mean it's not like it's something new we got cameras everywhere inside here
        8:32
    i guess we'll just go with the flow means it's unaccented accented in
        8:37
    pentameter you see five meters so there's five feet so you say the robbed
        8:44
    that smiles steals some things from the thief
        8:49
    right so you see i'm saying that's one line of poetry right see the robbed unaccented accent the rod that smiles
        8:57
    steals something from the thief the class is studying shakespeare's
        9:03
    othello among the day's activities is reading lost scenes or fictitious scenes that
        9:09
    the students have composed themselves man remind me it should never piss you off because you got some serious issues
        9:15
    for real but i like it because you're keeping it real too and just looking out for your set and your little homies we
        9:22
    gotta jet and see what's we gotta see what plays out with these two cats later
        9:27
    days hey you take me in feed me told me teach
        9:32
    me how to grow food and everything and then my grandson comes and kills off the other casio and
        9:39
    40 other of these guys come up and cassio's like what up and he comes in with 40 guys and they
        9:45
    saved the day and uh it's basically you know iago's like okay
        9:50
    so like what were you gonna say he's like oh tyler says nothing you know just that we waited
        9:56
    right i promise what promised chuck i've sent a bit cassio come speak with you
        10:02
    i have a salt and sorry rhythm a friend offends me
        10:09
    offends me lend me thy handkerchief
        10:15
    the cat's literally gonna go on so so i have a question for you is this
    Is this class indicative of your other classes
        10:22
    class indicative of your other classes that you've been teaching for three years
        10:27
    yeah i think so it's it's changed um and evolved i got a chance in
        10:33
    2013 to go to a rethinking prisons conference at vanderbilt and while i was there i got to go to
        10:39
    riverbend maximum security prison and see how they run their education program as well
        10:44
    and that's why that's where i saw i witnessed the uh inmates running the program you know moderating leading
        10:51
    the agenda and brilliant idea so that's what we do uh every week now
        10:58
    um but i think that is pretty indicative uh in this semester's seminar which just started uh last week
        11:05
    actually has 16 inside participants and 11 outside participants so it's a big
        11:10
    class right now so great brandon were you able to take classes on
    Were you able to take classes on the inside and outside
        11:16
    the inside as well as on the outside yeah yeah i took a couple um
        11:24
    i took advantage of a couple classes they had as far as like mental health like anger management and stuff like
        11:30
    that and then i was there for the first day of v for vendetta
        11:36
    and then i got released after that so i didn't get to continue any like the academic
        11:43
    classes okay and then i remember from the documentary you were friends with marcos
        11:49
    you guys started talking and you ended up starting to take classes at uas is that right yeah well actually um
        11:57
    marcos and i we went in on the same day so we yeah
        12:03
    same same you know and we were in ao for like a week it was my
        12:10
    first time first time getting in trouble you know it's just like you know what alex said
        12:15
    it just takes that one moment and it changes your life forever and that's what happened to me i
        12:21
    um you know i was uh i worked for hope community resources
        12:26
    you know and i'm sure many of you know what hope is here in town and then you know went downtown got
        12:33
    inebriated and got into a fight and woke up in a l and
        12:39
    a l uh admitting and observation yeah
        12:45
    and that's where i met marcos and then after that him and i started talking and and i'm
        12:52
    from the village you know 650 people where i'm from and he's from la so like i'm like
        12:59
    interested in you know like
        13:05
    actually i was a little scared it was my first time it was my you know it was my first time in jail and i'm
        13:11
    like i'm this big guy and i'm like you know all of a sudden you get into those bars
        13:18
    you hear those bark and things change and you know i was a little i was a little
        13:24
    afraid at first and then i talked to marcos and you know he just think kind of
        13:31
    got me out of being scared and then got sensed then i was depressed and then
        13:38
    you know it started started working out and then just like let's do this
        13:45
    yes we can and yes we can yeah we can um and then after that
        13:53
    after the class i got out and then i started working at a fast food place
        14:00
    here in town and then you know it just got i got old you i was
        14:07
    working my tail off 50 60 hours a week for for pennies
        14:12
    and then um then he got to the halfway house and
        14:18
    actually i think i went to go i got we got approved to hang out by our
        14:23
    probation officers and i went to the to the halfway house to go visit him and then um bought me a pair of shoes i bought
        14:30
    him a pair of shoes when he got out i was trying to make sure you know because when you when you get out to the halfway
        14:35
    house um like when i went in when i went to the halfway house they left i was
        14:41
    i had a pair of trunks and a a t-shirt because my clothes were evidence so they couldn't give me my clothes that
        14:48
    i went in with and so when he got out i bought him a pair of shoes and kind of make sure that everything was
        14:54
    you know chaos and what he needed and and then you know that's when we became friends that's when things got
        15:01
    you know closer turned into a brotherhood and then it kind of you know
        15:08
    it plat i plateaued out for a second and then my mom passed away and then i relapsed and i actually went
        15:15
    back and when i went back i seen him and i was like marcos you
        15:21
    know and then like he's like no no yeah and uh
        15:27
    after that you know it was because i love you bro yeah no it's tough love is the best love i think
        15:34
    and um when i got released you know after my mom passed away
        15:41
    you know i had the son he's he'll be two years in april and that motivated me
        15:47
    and so i got sober and you know end of the month it'll be two years
        15:52
    so like
        16:00
    and then then after that you know i went got hired back at subway
        16:05
    and then um as marcos start they started having these flying university events and he
        16:11
    started inviting me and started going uh there was one at noise pavilion that
        16:17
    we had you know a testimonies and then i was just a
        16:23
    spectator and then then
        16:28
    next thing you know he invites me over for dinner and i go over
        16:33
    for dinner and he busts out at his computer and he's like let's fill your fafsa and i'm like what are you talking about it was a trap
        16:39
    what's this fafsa yeah charge it to my fafsa
        16:48
    and so i filled out the fafsa that day that day um we enrolled in the social sciences
        16:54
    yeah we uh turned in my application to uas two
        16:59
    weeks later i got letter of acceptance and and you know that
        17:05
    it was man that changed my life you know i just broke down and kind of just like
        17:11
    it's kind of things you know when i was a kid like that's that was my dream is to go to college and
        17:17
    and uh you know i was 12 years since since i've been in
        17:22
    high school and uh you know 12 years later here i am
        17:28
    my third semester in i got a 3.0
    Where do you get out of prison
        17:36
    i have a question about the day you get out where does that begin
        17:42
    sean you want to answer this where do they where do they leave you do you have do you walk to the halfway house do you
        17:48
    get a ride somewhere well no
        17:53
    usually when they let you out and not release the halfway house they just kick you out the door
        17:59
    out into the parking lot it doesn't matter if it's summer winter nothing yeah it'll just kick you out
        18:06
    what are you wearing do you have money that could be right like if if if i wasn't going to the halfway house
        18:12
    which they came and picked me up and they drove me to the halfway house like right down the street but if i wasn't going to halfway house i got released in
        18:18
    like a ripped shirt and um broken pants the button on my pants were broken i don't know how that happened
        18:25
    and i didn't really have anything to wear i had a sweater that i bought inside
        18:32
    um lemon creek but that's about it cara how about you when you got out what was your day like
        18:38
    well i i mean i've gotten out many times so let's just get that straight right now
    Clothing in prison
        18:45
    um but after doing a lengthy time in prison um i remember i mean none of my clothes fit me first of all
        18:51
    and nothing fit me because when i went in i was like a size double zero you
        18:56
    know i'm coming out a size 12. um you know maybe not that drastic but it
        19:02
    was a it's a pretty big drastic change and um i actually had prison closed and
        19:08
    on the on the inside you're lucky when you get sweats and those are like exciting things to have when you can afford to get some sweats
        19:15
    and they're usually like 10 times too big and you're not supposed to get from other people that you do and you know
        19:21
    and all these different things yeah and so i personally did not have money
        19:29
    while i was in prison and so you know you find ways to make it work close is a big issue especially as a
        19:35
    woman i mean i know guys i mean you guys can handle that but when we're getting
        19:40
    out you know we want we don't want to be wearing clothes that are three sizes too small for us
        19:46
    you know and you're already feeling that shame and where am i going and the terrified feeling of you have no idea
        19:54
    what you're doing i mean and i had a lot more resources than a lot of people and i was just
        19:59
    terrified i mean you wait for that day you wait for that day you know you wait you wait wait for that day and it comes
        20:05
    and then what i mean i personally went to the three-quarter house after that and built
        20:12
    from there but man that's a whole other story in itself
        20:18
    so that was one of many times yeah and i suspect that's part of the inspiration for the haven house and you are now the
        20:25
    director at the haven house yeah i mean that comes from all of this i mean just
        20:30
    it inspiring not just as people have been formally incarcerated but then gathering those that have helped us
        20:37
    along the way when we talk about like saul and chris and paul i mean these are all people all
        20:42
    the pos inside and out i mean these are people that said that word that one word
        20:47
    to us that just kept us going for that time and then to see i feel like i grew up with all of these wonderful gentlemen
        20:55
    here because i kind of got out at the same time when this was all occurring i was
        21:02
    in an english class with karen mitchell and i remember her mentioning the flying nerd percy i'm like what why don't i
        21:09
    know about this why isn't this there for women you know of course because i'm all about me at that time
        21:14
    and so i you know immediately when i met saul i mean and i met marcos and nathan and
        21:21
    all the others that have come in i mean immediate connection you know and just really trying to empower each other
        21:28
    and give that opportunity because we didn't even know we had it we didn't know we were capable of that we
        21:33
    didn't even know now here we are being that change you know and and those closest to the problem our closest to
        21:40
    the solution and just really keeping each other inspired and then inspiring others not
        21:45
    just who have been incarcerated but the entire communities to bring those opportunities yes absolutely
    Going directly to university
        21:51
    and nathan you mentioned in the documentary that you you didn't stop anywhere you just went
        21:58
    directly to the university on the day that you got out that's not to like say that treatment
        22:03
    and the job center are obsolete in my life i mean they did help me but i knew what i wanted to do and where
        22:10
    i had to go to do it and there was nothing going to stop me luckily i had the permission of my pos
        22:15
    to go and get education at school and apply because you don't necessarily get the chance to go out there you have to
        22:21
    get permission to do that and they knew that i was serious about this and from the get-go they knew that i was going to
        22:26
    do that so that also was like a huge part of it as well so it seems like having that connection on the outside
        22:32
    with saul and universe the flying university was huge
        22:37
    well it was great because we were actually doing a creative writing class that
        22:43
    semester um and uh so one of professor wahl's students was coming inside flying
        22:50
    university and leading a creative writing workshop inside lemon creek and because of that
    Poetry Slam
        22:58
    group that community that he met inside the prison from uas when he got out they said you've he got out and that
        23:05
    following friday there was a poetry slam in town and they told him you got to come to the poetry slam so he shows up
        23:12
    and he won right he won the poetry slam and yeah it was great and uh and then he
        23:17
    sat in on my classes he just sat in that took a lot of convincing to let
        23:22
    them let me do that they're like well it's you're not it's not a job and you don't really get credit for it but i
        23:29
    eventually got to do it and i think i think we we all realized at this point that i mean the fact that you came there
        23:35
    to uh just sit in on my class for that semester enabled you to get things together
        23:40
    and as marcos helps sean and brandon and other folks get their fafsa together we
        23:46
    realize that we really need a one semester transition if we could institutionalize a one semester
        23:52
    transition that allows people to get their affairs in order maybe take a three-credit college preparatory class
        23:59
    specifically for people transitioning we could actually be bringing it i talked to um
        24:05
    uh uh somebody from talia ames from second chance program um
        24:11
    we could bring in 10 people a year to uas we could bring 10 people a year
    We could bring 10 people a year
        24:17
    would you say that's that's accurate i think that's very accurate especially working with women coming out of the
        24:23
    prison system um i mean we want to do that but when we can't take a full load to fill out a
        24:29
    fafsa it just feels impossible because we're we're dealing with many things as as we know but and the
        24:35
    community is learning because we're educating you know on all the barriers that we find but we want to do this
        24:41
    people want jobs they want to go to school we want to do these things and that is an excellent idea i know um
        24:48
    probably everyone that i work with you know would love to do that also one of the real amazing parts was
        24:55
    when i was going there to sit in your class i wasn't enrolled but i would walk by the windows of the classes and all
        25:02
    the students from the first flying university class in the on the on the university side knocking on the windows
        25:08
    oh i know you i just felt like a rock star like not even going to school and i'm already like cool
    The stigma of being a felon
        25:16
    backing up just a little bit for a second you know shawn you get out of prison you have a ripped shirt or a pair
        25:22
    of sweatpants in the documentary brandon you talk about the stigma of
        25:28
    having been a person who's been in jail before we have that clip i'd like to take a look at that
        25:36
    i got out and then you know it's like my first experience you know
        25:43
    like realizing what it is to be a felon is like
        25:49
    go apply at every job possible and think that you know i have a good resume in it
        25:54
    but once you check that film box it's like no matter what your resume looks like
        25:59
    you know once you check that phone box people are automatically assumed you know
        26:05
    whoa what kind of person you are marcos will you talk a little bit about
    Im a person not a number
        26:11
    that stigma um
        26:16
    i have uh this on i've been told that i over share
        26:22
    so um and that was from a girlfriend um who
        26:28
    said that maybe i shouldn't be so open but a great mentor of mine back in
        26:33
    california because uas is my third attempt at college
        26:38
    i went to a community college that was very very grassroots very beautiful and she told me to own it because it
        26:45
    could never be used against me if i own it so i own it and i tell everybody from
        26:51
    the gate you know i did five years eight months in california i did four years and um
        26:57
    here in alaska i was in federal housing for a year and a half um
        27:03
    you know i've done a lot of time i'm not sure
        27:12
    how i truly feel about that because i tell a lot of people you know that you know i pour my
        27:18
    feelings on my sleeves um but at the end of the day i hate words like felon i hate words
        27:24
    like parolee i hate words like convict when they say how do you want to be
        27:30
    identified i want to be identified as marcos my name is marcos united state citizen i vote i pay taxes
        27:38
    i have a license i work go to school i'm not a bad guy you know once you say
        27:44
    failing they're like what did he do you know um did he sell drugs did he shoot somebody
        27:51
    did you know you get all these preconceived notions about you before they get to know you and we as
        27:58
    individuals who've been incarcerated we say we have a saying i'm a person not a number because when
        28:04
    you go see your pos they have this file i'm not that you know a lot of people like the i mean we all say it i'm not
        28:09
    that file that's not me you don't know me a lot of people are the file but there
        28:15
    are some of us that we don't want to be judged by that file right um and when you have a
        28:20
    hundred people on your caseload you end up becoming you know that number you know marcos
        28:25
    galindo is 60 87.60 you know in california was f 22 800.
        28:31
    you know um now i just want to be marcos that's it i don't want to be anything else but
        28:37
    marcos because i work really hard to get where i'm at and i'm not handicapped
        28:42
    by my past yes you know i won't i i will not allow it to handicap me anymore so
        28:47
    there's there's been times where where i've just like all of us
    Im a felon
        28:53
    up here now are good socially we're good social good we're all good um
        28:59
    speakers and good there's been times where i've held a conversation with
        29:05
    somebody and you know and and then like something comes up with like oh i can't do that i can't i can't
        29:11
    go out hunting or you know it's because i'm a felon i can't have a gun and then all of a sudden it's just like
        29:18
    i can't go to the theater like yeah like like they don't want to talk to me anymore like oh they don't want to have
        29:24
    they don't want to hear what i have to say you know once once they once they hear that i'm a felon it's
        29:31
    like oh okay you know because even if like i remember
        29:36
    um in rose marie's class comms teacher um you know you look up you look up the
        29:42
    definition like google felony google felon and the first
        29:48
    sentence is like um a person who has committed a serious
        29:53
    crime punishable by death or life imprisonment like man
        30:00
    that's that's not me like that's that's the webster's definition of a felon and so
        30:06
    you know when when uh that's if you haven't gone through dlc worked
        30:12
    with doc if you haven't been in that in that
        30:17
    world i should say because it really is um then you don't really know like you
        30:23
    don't know like it's different it's it's just it's
        30:29
    it's hard to come up with these words i guess what what are some
    Examples
        30:34
    practical crimes that qualify one as a felon or a felony what are can you give
        30:41
    us some examples i i i have i work uh as a as i consider myself social
        30:46
    scientists now um i major you know that's my major that's the way i'm being trained to think
        30:53
    um two individuals who i owe my
        30:58
    academic career to are in the audience
        31:04
    glenn wright who is not only my professor but my counselor he's my advisor but he like
        31:11
    listens to me like whine and complain and life's too hard
        31:16
    and trying to kick the can down the road and he gives me the what i need to succeed
        31:22
    the other is dan monty professor of anthropology at uas and
        31:27
    professor monty i didn't know how to i'm very good at you know she's my language sorry
        31:36
    and that guy i uh it got me a long way
        31:41
    so i bs my way through college write an essay here essay there i didn't know how to write an essay there's a
        31:48
    formula to write in this uh a very
        31:53
    well-written social science essay and i didn't know how to do that so
        31:58
    instead of being prideful as khan you know as people who dumb time you put on this this wall that i don't know how to
        32:04
    do that um i went and asked them you know finally i just was like i don't know how
        32:10
    to do that i don't know what a bibliography is so i got to play by play
        32:15
    um professor monteith gave me a play-by-play of how to write an essay i
        32:21
    am very confident that i can write essays now you know um
        32:27
    and uh during writing those that's the reason why i i brought that up is because i'm working
        32:33
    on an essay right now that i will use as my senior project um
        32:39
    there's a humongous difference between crimes born of poverty
        32:45
    and crimes of a predatorial nature and we need to understand that as a community the state needs to take
        32:51
    responsibility and not trying to shift blame here the state needs to take responsibility of the ses of the social
        32:58
    economical status that they created for individuals living whether it's rural communities here in alaska
        33:06
    whether it's valuables in east l.a compton
        33:12
    bronx new york southside chicago i challenge anyone to go to la
        33:18
    and go to watts and then go to calabasas and tell me the huge difference between
        33:24
    the two and tell me the schools the difference between the schools
        33:29
    of those two cities um of those two parts of valley county
        33:36
    being funded by the same county be seen being funded by the same city
        33:41
    vast difference and you're telling me you didn't create this monster that you didn't create this
        33:47
    individual this monster this criminal this uh
        33:53
    danger to society you need to take some responsibility for what happened because
        33:58
    when all you see is drug dealers and killers and gang members around you and you don't see teachers and doctors and
        34:05
    lawyers you don't think you could be a teacher a doctor or a lawyer all you think you can be is a drug
        34:12
    dealer a gang banger or the list goes on can you repeat that
        34:17
    crime is born of poverty or there's a difference between crimes born of poverty and crimes of a predatorial nature
        34:24
    there's people who are there are people out there in life who need help there's people out there who
        34:31
    hurt people because of the joy of hurting people there's killers there's sex offenders
        34:37
    there's the list goes on of people who enjoy hurting somebody and then there's people
        34:44
    who don't know how to provide for their family there's people who only know how to sell cocaine and heroin because they
        34:51
    use it and it's a way to support a habit because it it allows them to escape it allows them to escape
        34:58
    the horror of their life you know um i remember i got shot in the face when i was 16 years old
        35:06
    no i'm trying to feel sorry for me i try to shoot him so it's it's um
        35:12
    you know uh the at its basic form is flight or flight living in the body or the hoods of urban
        35:18
    of urban cities and to have and not have the state except some of
        35:24
    the burden is inhumane it's it's not cool at all
    Shared Responsibility
        35:30
    so you wanted to mention something yeah that's that's perfect uh in the documentary diane casto talks about a
        35:37
    shared responsibility and i think that's really critical to rethinking
        35:42
    justice and community we really need to move from a discourse of personal
        35:47
    responsibility to a political uh responsibility and when we when we
        35:52
    start talking about political responsibility we start talking about things like economic inequality and
        35:58
    institutionalized racism and institutionalized you know contempt
        36:03
    against the poor and peoples of color and then we can begin
        36:09
    the difficult critical analysis the the necessary self-examination
        36:15
    and we're not blaming people part of the problem with addressing prison reform is that people in
        36:22
    institutions feel like when we critique the system we're blaming individuals
        36:27
    we're trying to shift from blame to critique and as we shift from blame to critique then we're not looking necessarily for
        36:34
    causes of recidivism or causes of mass incarceration but we're looking at what
        36:40
    are these what are these phenomena symptoms of right so one in three black men ages 18
        36:46
    to 34 in the u.s is in the prison system in a lot in the state of alaska alaska
        36:53
    nation we get 15 of the general population but 37 of the prison population over representation
        36:59
    in the prison system by alaska natives that's a symptom of something yes what is this symptom of it's a symptom of
        37:05
    colonialism institutionalized racism uh indifference you know and
        37:12
    that's the kind of focus that we really need uh to pick up here and um and then
        37:18
    and then we're shifting um you know when we talk about this stuff when we talk about political
        37:23
    responsibility we're talking about symptoms and in in and the structural problems
        37:29
    people will frequently say to me well aren't you just abstracting away from the individual
        37:34
    and i say no if if you continue to persist in this very reductive
        37:39
    discourse of choice you made bad choices you are treating the individual in an abstract
        37:46
    way if you instead understand the story of a person
        37:52
    with this genealogy of sorrow and joy right structuralized racism uh and and and and
        38:01
    contempt for the poor when that's part of an individual's story then you've got a more rich sense of the
        38:06
    individual i think our prison system is there's a there's a distinction between individualism and individuality that one
        38:14
    of my favorite critical theorists james marsh makes actually james marshall was mark matustik's teacher
        38:20
    he's in the documentary um and he says individualism is the quantitative sameness imposed on everyone
        38:28
    right and you think about monopoly the monopoly board game right everybody starts 1500
        38:34
    everybody's on go right but individuality is the qualitative awareness of self and other
        38:41
    and then the more accurate monopoly game would be where you've got five classes maybe right you've got one group already
        38:47
    owns boardwalk and park place with five thousand dollars in the bank and they control the bank you go down to the lowest class which
        38:54
    begins in prison you know um you know this is this is part of uh thinking
        39:00
    about community historical violence transgenerational trauma i think it's i think it's bracketed
        39:06
    what's that you're going to say i'll take avenue right did i
    The Big City
        39:11
    interject here for a minute it's it's the track that i made right um
        39:16
    um brandon said uh you know he said i was from the big city you know um
        39:22
    my career as as
        39:28
    a gangster you know um being recruited
        39:33
    into a into a latino prison gang um
        39:38
    sent me to los angeles i used to come back and forth from los angeles i'm originally
        39:43
    from a small small small farming community of migrant workers in the center of
        39:50
    california towns like vicelia goshen tulare hanford fresno
        39:57
    bakersfield um i grew up around picking like my family picked fruit
        40:04
    i cut grapes that's what we did didn't like it i wanted something better
        40:10
    i got recruited um i was like 14.
        40:16
    um and i went back to los angeles i was playing so stationed it's like an air soldier stationed in
        40:22
    los angeles um and i you know got my first apartment when i was 14
        40:28
    in los angeles um and i would get sent back and forth to make you know because my family is from
        40:35
    okinawa chihuahua in juarez and we got connections in el paso
        40:41
    so since my connections are keep coming back and forth and the trek that i see
        40:48
    from the small farming communities
        40:53
    down to los angeles el paso juarez
        40:58
    um and then up here in alaska
        41:03
    um was the same thing right i seen on a on different scales grand scale
        41:09
    small skills but i see the exact same thing was that all these communities
        41:16
    were overtaken by the prison subculture right um
        41:22
    vast amounts of racism
        41:29
    and not being able to pinpoint the reasons why
        41:34
    you know um not being able to how do we fix this being in los angeles
        41:40
    and seeing a city of 9 million people 52 of that 9 million people are hispanic but how many
        41:46
    how come not everybody on the board at ucla is latino how come your community
        41:51
    doesn't reflect the population how come our police department isn't latino how come um you know we had the mayor
        41:58
    but yeah we didn't have um you know how can we have every every senate seat how come we don't have every
        42:05
    um uh uh rep seat how come we don't have those it's because we don't vote we don't we
        42:11
    don't we we look at things on the level of the prison subculture right we like to be in the shadows we
        42:17
    look at it like oh well let the gabasha's do what they're gonna do you know and
        42:23
    um we'll just sit here and do you know shout though um
        42:29
    we'll run the streets this this petty mentality of how come
        42:35
    you know if the prison is the vast majority of latinos you know that that reflects the community
        42:42
    but yet all these positions of power don't reflect the community i didn't understand that that's what pushed me to
        42:47
    to to major in politics is i see the power of this latin vote right in these big
        42:53
    communities like here in alaska you see the power of the indigenous vote right
        42:58
    but we need we need to mobilize that right we need to mobilize these individuals who represent the community
        43:04
    to come out and put the uh him where it hurts hit him at the ballot box
        43:14
    13 minutes left here for this show time goes fast no it this has been great i wish we had a lot more time we need to
        43:21
    do a full series but with our last minutes here on the show i would i would say the common
        43:27
    denominator in your success seems to be community right and that's the name of this show
        43:33
    tonight or having these connections in the community and it seems like we need to build these
        43:39
    connections and opportunities for communities not only here in juneau but for communities around the state to
        43:45
    connect with the people who are in prison so i'd like to use these last minutes to brainstorm
        43:51
    how we can improve those connections with the community how we can get more people
        43:56
    like saul neely in classrooms volunteering to teach what are your ideas and i would like to
        44:02
    get a couple questions from the audience or a couple ideas from the audience if you could in the next coming minutes
        44:09
    maybe line up at the microphone um but
        44:14
    so maybe a new voice um we have we have a voice right here and
    Paul Gonzalez
        44:23
    from christopher paul gonzalez oh you guys seen him in the documentary
        44:30
    and uh it's a long voice um
        44:37
    uh and if you don't mind i'm sorry i was trying to get in there to say this to
        44:43
    paul uh to for for aussie and if you would like to read it or if you would like to read it
        44:49
    i'll see he's the man you know he's in there he's in there for another 18 years
        44:56
    so being able to have his presence here would be beautiful big shout out to mountain view he wanted but a shout out to mountain view um
        45:04
    so i don't know who would like to i think i think it's appropriate chris was unable to make it here this evening
        45:11
    because he's in lemon creek right now so to have his voice on this show i think is appropriate and yeah one of you like
        45:17
    to read it i'll read it all right stand up
        45:24

        45:36
    coordinators paul mccarthy and chris chris wax orchestrating all the educational
        45:41
    programs that are available to the inmates at lemon creek congressional center this is a kite
        45:48

        45:56

        46:15
    monument fine university and i am pr a proud member i proud

        46:44
    for my voice to be heard as well as others inside the prison there are not many educational classes
        46:50
    that are like professor saul sauls that bring outside student
        46:55
    from uas to participate in cover topics such such as
        47:01
    our class we are taking this course ethics and we are taking this course as
        47:07
    ethics in the form of philosophy thank you scott and his cameraman for shooting one of our
        47:14
    classes in the interview that kto for
        47:20
    think for producing and showing their peace and allowing my voice to be heard
        47:26
    i believe there needs to be more classes like this and in form
        47:31
    of education in the prison system knowledge is power
        47:38
    and the time spent learning helps from a productive member of society ps
        47:45
    hi professor saul and his mother from chris
        47:59
    all right and closing thoughts how can we improve community connections cara do
    Community Connections
        48:06
    you have an idea i have many ideas but for a sense of time here you know community connections
        48:13
    is key to this we have a lot of amazing things going on in our community with legislators you know um doc i mean
        48:20
    there's just so much change going on and i would say if you see something going on out there whether it's the re-entry
        48:26
    coalition haven else flying university second chance act you know what there's many things going on just plug in we're
        48:32
    going to try and get those out there but just show up you know it is about community we heard us all
        48:39
    say that here somebody believed in us and we moved forward somebody believed in us inside and somebody believed in us
        48:46
    outside and now we get to cultivate other leaders to empower us to rise up and kind of be that change and we get to
        48:53
    meet people at the gate or do whatever we need to do to to bring that encouragement and it's
        48:58
    so crucial it's so crucial i wouldn't be here today i wouldn't even i wouldn't be here with these amazing guys and be a
        49:04
    part of this movement here so go i think as as for people like that are on the
        49:10
    inside that haven't got out yet it's i think what i've been thinking about is like to visually
        49:18
    demand a formula to get out um because i got off probation three months early and
        49:24
    the people i talked to in the department of corrections is like people don't get off early and i got off three months
        49:30
    early and in march i'll be going back for the success inside and out program
        49:37
    to to speak and just to give them you know hopefully give them a formula because some people
        49:43
    they just they don't see the light you know there's so many so many people that you know just they
        49:49
    they're uninformed for the longest time i didn't even know i could vote after i caught my felony and i remember on my
        49:56
    letter that i got from department of corrections saying that i'm no longer on probation don't forget
        50:02
    to register to vote i have friends at home my friends at home for yacht had that that have gone through doc that they don't even know
        50:09
    that they have the right to vote like get out there and vote let's let's show the people that are on the inside
        50:14
    that there is a formula and we are it yeah and you get we are part
        50:20
    of this we are part of it tells you that yeah nathan i was warned not to be too academic um i
        50:27
    don't think i could top solve but i'll try um community needs to be
        50:32
    based on the solidarity of alterity like the unification of our differences if we
        50:38
    keep judging and othering people because of differences this is more violence is going to come from that and that's all
        50:43
    will come from that that's my belief below thank you quick and simple
        50:50
    um yeah so what was the question what can what can the juno community do
        50:57
    what can the alaska state community do to support people getting out of prison or in prison
    What can the community do
        51:03
    um just just show up just just be there put it in the face time to say i mean if you
        51:10
    want to see your community change just uh you know keep um keep your ear out keep you know like
        51:16
    i'm i'm over at the capitol building you know advocating for uh senate bills that that affect us that affects us and
        51:23
    affects our community and and uh just keep your ear out for stuff and i mean i see people on facebook all
        51:29
    the time like oh our community has turned into uh you know so bad it used to be so good you know and uh oh people
        51:36
    are overdosing on heroin you know and and then you get on facebook and whine about it and
        51:43
    and it stops there you know you don't you know you don't fight for your you know and
        51:48
    that's a that's it that's a big testament and i scream that all the time it's like talk talk is cheap
    Talk is cheap
        51:54
    talk is so so cheap it's about action you want your thing to grow you go out there and you
        52:00
