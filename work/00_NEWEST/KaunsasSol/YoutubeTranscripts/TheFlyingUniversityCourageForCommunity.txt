      we're excited to host host you tonight with us professor Saul Neely and our
          0:07
      associate of the flying university so again thanks for joining us I also just want to thank the Student Alumni
          0:13
      Association they help provide some snacks and encourage some students to be here so thanks to the snow and ice
          0:19
      association there are just so many amazing stories to share about UAS and
          0:26
      it's the mission of the u.s. alumni and Friends Association to keep alumni and
          0:33
      our broader community connected with UAS and it's also we just heard of our
          0:41
      mission to highlight to highlight and all these impactful and amazing things
          0:48
      that are going on at UAS so this is just serving as another platform for something amazing that's happening at UA
          0:53
      ask to share with our broader community and then tonight there are two ways that
          1:00
      you can support UAS you can become the first way is becoming a member of
          1:05
      Friends of alumni and Friends and then the second is to support and contribute
          1:11
      to our new flying University so if you
          1:17
      feel inclined or inspired to support UAS in any way those are a couple ways and
          1:22
      I'll have an opportunity at the end to talk a little bit more about this new fund that directly supports the
          1:28
      university but before we get started I'd like to introduce Saul a lot of you know
          1:34
      Saul already and it's been really wonderful for to work with Saul I
          1:40
      haven't really had the opportunity to have a class of his or to work this closely with him and it's also been a
          1:47
      really great opportunities to meet some of the participants and students of the
          1:53
      flying University there's just it's just amazing to see all the passion
          1:58
      surrounded around this so I'm happy that we could share this with a larger audience we also have our live streaming
          2:05
      today so if you know people you can go back and watch the recording this presentation and I don't have
          2:13
      Saul's bio memory so I'm just gonna read it a lot of you know him but I think it just gives us a good understanding of where
          2:20
      Saul come from where he comes from and why he started at the flying University so Saul he's the associate professor of
          2:27
      English at a velocity here at UAS he teaches classes in critical theory
          2:32
      literary theory philosophy and as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation critical
          2:38
      Indigenous Studies Saul completed his PhD in 2009 from Purdue University's
          2:45
      philosophy and literature program and he's also taught as an adjunct professor
          2:50
      in Indiana's State University's now-defunct Corrections education program when he arrived at UAS he came
          2:59
      with the intention of getting it back into the prisons and teaching after three years of networking within our
          3:05
      community that opportunity finally presented itself and in 2012 he started
          3:13
      work on a building what has become now the flying university this initiative
          3:18
      has grown over the six-and-a-half years and has become an embedded aspect of
          3:25
      prison life insight lemon Creek and this initiative also had become just a
          3:31
      re-entry effort and here in Juneau and across the state and tonight we're here
          3:37
      to celebrate and develop this endeavor with your help so again thank you for being here I'm going to turn this over
          3:42
      to Saul and he's going to give you a little bit more background on how he started the fine University so thanks
          3:55
      and thanks for showing up on a Tuesday night here's yeah I really appreciate it
          4:07
      the kind of a awkward evening of the week I know to have an event like this but this room is booked for the next
          4:14
      three days and the spring break and all of that I want to thank Jesse and Shawna
          4:20
      O'Sullivan and over there in Lynn Johnson for all the incredible help
          4:28
      setting this up the fine university is unique among prison education programs
          4:34
      as far as I can tell in the nation because we became a reentry effort that's just because of the way our
          4:39
      community works it's a small community people are incarcerated they get out they know some of the outside students
          4:46
      that I bring in and for that reason as we've become a reentry effort as well
          4:52
      getting these resources together so that people can try to take college credit
          4:58
      classes inside the prison with me debt free or they can get out of prison and if they want to try you a s they can do
          5:06
      that we're building these resources to help that kind of reentry effort as well so that we can provide scholarships for
          5:14
      a couple classes of semesters and help with housing occasion help buying books these kinds of things so they can give
          5:21
      College a try and learn if it's for that Murph it's not for that again without
          5:26
      going into debt I can't hectically bring these folks into debt so I want to thank Jesse Shana and Lynn for all their work
          5:33
      and helping set this up it's phenomenal opportunity I couldn't have done it without them I also want to thank the
          5:39
      students who are helping us tonight thank you all for assisting us I want to
          5:45
      thank Gloria media services our panelists here in KJ over there and and
          5:54
      I've really because of all of this work that Jesse's and Shaun have been setting
          6:00
      up I've had a number of speaking engagements this semester which have been really nice including an hour-long
          6:05
      interview with Schroeder and so I have to do this I have to give a shout-out to my daughter
          6:11
      Mila she was watching on the YouTube channel right now she can't be here
          6:16
      because it's it's close to her bedtime but I promised her a shout-out and and
          6:24
      we're also doing a thing I believe everybody got a little piece of paper as you came in we're just gonna do a Wordle
          6:30
      experiment we're gonna ask in one word what is necessary for a healthy community to to thrive so we're gonna
          6:38
      fill that out and then they're gonna put that into a Wordle and at the end of the event we're going to see with that with
          6:44
      the word conflict like the title for the
          6:50
      event tonight is courage for community dialogues on hope and higher education inside Alaska's prisons i titled it
          6:57
      courage for community because right now our political moment is characterized by fear and it's it's really tragic
          7:05
      we have scapegoating we have fear of immigrants we have fear of you know just
          7:13
      so much fear fear of college professors right anti intellectualism is rampant I
          7:19
      worked really hard with a bunch of community members many of whom are right here on SB 91 and that's being reversed
          7:27
      right in part because of fear it's not based off of anything that has it's not
          7:33
      based off data it's not based off any evidence it's simply emotional an ideological fear and so and I teach my intro to
          7:41
      philosophy class and we always start with Cornel West who says that courage is the enabling virtue for any philosopher encouraged to think courage
          7:47
      to hope courage to love and so I think about that in terms of of community to
          7:54
      really pull together as a community in the way that we need to it does require
          7:59
      courage I remember one time I had a actually it was with Ricky on Alena and
          8:05
      KJ and David Cassidy we met with a police chief Johnson right Johnson
          8:11
      restaurant Brice Johnson and we've met with him about developing policies for
          8:17
      police a body Mounted Police and he was talking about how his first priority was to protect the community
          8:23
      and it became really clear to me that what he meant by community would you Accord straight a bunch of people and whoever is left over his community as
          8:29
      opposed to thinking that the people incarcerated inside our prisons are our neighbors and our friends and our family
          8:35
      members that they are that our community member and so thinking about courage for
          8:41
      community in that way tonight we're gonna host a community dialogue in three
          8:47
      acts we're going to talk about inside perspectives and my friend and colleague
          8:54
      Kendall Newman is gonna help talk about inside perspectives and then we're going
          9:00
      to do outside perspectives with Kevin Jones will Geiger and Rickie Annalee
          9:06
      know Blake Fletcher's supposed to join us he's out here somebody wants to text him go okay Blake is not here right okay
          9:15
      I'll text under the mat and then community advocacy perspective
          9:20
      KJ Metcalf is going to join us he's been very generous with the flying University funding and Peggy has funded a couple of
          9:28
      fine University scholarships the decision to take my classes for college credit and then we have Christina love
          9:35
      and Rosie Ian's us and they'll join us we're going to do that sort of talk shows Todd so once you come up and
          9:40
      you're part of the panel just stay part of the panel yeah so yeah to get us
          9:48
      started I pulled together clips from the flying University documentary that was
          9:54
      produced by Scott Burton from Katy oh oh because they showcase where the inside perspectives about on the fine
          10:02
      University so I think probably we can we can begin with that yeah it's about 13
          10:11
      minutes so we'll stay on track sound good everybody yes rockin good news a
          10:18

      [Music]
          11:09
      [Music]
          11:44
      and these guys figured out that nobody cares so if one person says they do it
          11:52
      fine we don't want to just reenter people back into the community we want
          11:57
      to get them get back into the community in a strong company and supported way so that they do not pursue this inspired by
          12:05
      programs such as inside out happening in the lower 48 tommy lee a professor of English at the
          12:11
      University of Alaska southeast began bringing students into Juno's Lemon Creek Correctional Facility in 2012
          12:18
      among the classes procedures is to have students moderate this week's leader is
          12:24
      Christopher Paul Gonzalez we are recording
          12:32
      [Music] class for about three years now
          12:39
      everything's pretty much stuff I miss the first one within every one half of that we've been a lot of different types
          12:48
      of classes like we did a fellow like we're doing right now we've done existentialism the city on
          12:55
      ban and we've done literature for not struggle of being ferromagnetic that one
          13:10
      [Music]
          13:16
      steals my money poetry rock rock
          13:26
      it's miles from beef the class the
          13:33
      setting Shakespeare's Othello among the base activities is reading the lost scenes or fictitious things that the
          13:40
      students have compose themselves prayer
          14:05
      much explanation exercise vows or here
          14:11
      is a number and sweating devil here as commonly rebels to say both hands do you
          14:20
      say so we're close my hand with a beret my heart is people is that all of their
          14:25
      ecology changes so quickly and jealousy in sickness take hold some paths but really like you know
          14:34
      coming just having come out of this very brutal water you a new life movies
          14:40
      probably know my family Iago person
          14:47
      neatly arranged for Katherine Joaquin join the class she's a professional actor playing Desdemona in perseverance
          14:54
      theatres fellow hearts hot spots the
          15:14
      guys then one of the class they enjoyed a lot and they need to get stuff out of it it's fun because if they don't a good
          15:23
      ok like one usually what happens is they come in and think I was a little tech processing yeah and then they discover
          15:29
      that on iron so bad so then they'll start taking any classes that are more
          15:35
      the social type classes and that's good because they learn I talk to people
          15:40
      because I mean I haven't seen really a
          15:47
      TEDWomen you know even you know cos you don't react the same way or you know have the same type relationship you live
          15:53
      with somebody you see on the street or you know things like that so it's good that they have that interaction I think
          16:00
      it's a it's a soft skill things that they don't learn or forget about what
          16:05
      most of the time I think it we haven't from them you know that that stuff it's integrated into and then maybe they'll
          16:11
      go to both guys that we're in here and now going to college full-time there's
          16:16
      all hoping to do the FAFSA applications and things like that takes
          16:55
      [Music]
          17:03
      [Music] the show you see in the moderator comes
          17:09
      in and that's great thing right there oh um just as well as participate just once
          17:19
      and like you see I forgot the one is
          17:25
      talking about his playing and how he performs with higher planning it brings
          17:57
      people in that normally would not come in they can see that they're just like
          18:04
      everybody else today's right there means those into did something bad but you know Thursday's in
          18:09
      here that we're good until they were thirty five forty five years old and made one mistake and that was a big
          18:15
      mistake and I was around her for a long time so it doesn't you know when one bad decision can just screw your left foot
          18:22
      big day you know and it's not just your freedom you lose you house news all your
          18:28
      stuff he had you know your clothes you know whatever you had it's time so
          18:36
      imagine all that sex gone you're in here for three three months somebody doesn't please let your stuff out you get out
          18:42
      now you don't have a house not even family doesn't anything to do you know all of all your possessions from civil
          18:50
      where's it floats to whatever you had you don't have that anymore you're supposed to get out and get a job to
          18:56
      meet your peel and you know go to the very top off glass and and be good not be stress and if you're stressed learn
          19:02
      how to not be stress and you don't really want to go back and three push universes yeah not stressful at all
          19:15
      [Music]
          19:26
      every job possible thank you know I could resume anything but once you check
          19:32
      that film box like no matter what resume looks like you know once you take that
          19:37
      song box people are automatically assume you know what kind of person you are
          19:44
      this is a shared responsibility that it's shared with result they may
          19:50
      certainly the inmate has to take responsibility for their actions but then we have to have a responsibility in
          19:57
      DLC to make sure we give them opportunities to improve those behaviors
          20:02
      to deal with the the aspects of their life through you know trauma in their
          20:08
      lives of being raised and alcohol because of child abuse you know poor
          20:15
      education whatever the case may be we have an opportunity and I think of responsibility to help build up those
          20:23
      deficits so that they can be successful and then the final part of the
          20:29
      responsibility is the communities again communities have got to help us and help
          20:35
      the inmates smooth transition back because again they are from these communities they are members
          20:42
      of these communities this is where they most often grew up and lived in and went
          20:47
      through their lives for inventing to be
          20:58
      from University first all introducing new classes that are available on campus
          21:06
      as well as in it right now I think it's worth noting that the program class no.1
          21:13
      along with you so there's no tax burden or anything like that what I would like
          21:21
      to see in five or ten years of fine University become is in a prison
          21:27
      education program that actually Awards University credits that would be a tremendous relief and we do have some
          21:36
      support for that on campus and with our administration these days right now they get certificates of completion some of
          21:43
      them are designated roll board or guys
          21:53
      as they just wrote a letter of recommendation for one of our guys just this week yeah so I can give that
          22:01
      negative incentive but if they can get college credit that would be even more meaningful for their lives we know that
          22:10
      education is critical component of successful reentry that education is one
          22:18
      of the most critical pieces if they do not have education and skills to be able to go back out in this Communion and
          22:25
      compete then they're most likely face applying University is unique in the state and
          22:31
      it's because of the resources available in Juneau those resources bury in the
          22:36
      communities the other facilities and their educational programs should
          22:42
      reflect those but there is something
          23:14
      more the first thing we have to do is completely reimagine how we understand
          23:20
      justice I mean that's the heart of it right there we need to think about
          23:25
      justice not in terms of retribution but something that is more along the lines of restorative justice but even their
          23:33
      story that justice is difficult to talk about with some people because what is
          23:39
      it that you're restoring and there is nothing there to restore in the first place it's hard to talk about rehabilitation it's some people have
          23:45
      never been habilitated we had one young man who was a piston defining University
          23:50
      who published a poem on our first publication of poetry reading my database is a heart-wrenching poem in
          23:59
      which he talks about his father locking and inside of the freezer just to see if he would freeze or throw me against the
          24:06
      wall a secret break in fact in the monitor this poem allowed it here I have in front of an auditorium
          24:11
      full of people and I barely held my tears back and I'm gonna read this poem it just really brings just my heart how
          24:19
      do you rehabilitate somebody who's never been habilitated so I think fundamentally reimagining how we
          24:26
      understand justice is the first thing that the community really needs to be
          24:31
      all right those are some [Applause]
          24:40
      yeah and one of the things I really like about what Scott Burton said toward the
          24:46
      end this is where we'll invite Kendall up here is he talked about which you
          24:52
      need about fine University and because of the community it's situated in which
          24:57
      is Juneau of course but one of the things we're excited to announce tonight as well as the creation of a statewide
          25:03
      effort called lion learning inside out network in Kendall Newman Sadiq has been
          25:09
      a part of that Enterprise with me and we
          25:15
      are connecting networking when a program she was a part of a Fairbanks Correctional Center called area 111 X do
          25:22
      you want to join us and start the panel
          25:32
      but yeah maybe you could just talk a little bit about area 111 X and also
          25:40
      Kendall just started sorry real thing Kendall is from UAF she works with you
          25:49
      campus she was also teaching a graduate class on digital storytelling right now so
          25:55
      it's been great networking with Kendall she's really incredible and but thinking
          26:03
      about she just started a writing a woman's writing workshop inside lemon Creek this week as well so you want to
          26:08
      talk about that yeah yeah we just started so there haven't been as so fine
          26:14
      universities been around for what nine ten years six and a half six and a half inflating your number feels longer
          26:22
      um it's established and there haven't there hasn't been an opportunity like
          26:28
      that for women and in that amount of time so there's close to like anyway I
          26:37
      don't know 20 women incarcerated about Lemon Creek and more like 200 men and they share any classroom or like
          26:44
      recreational spaces shared and they can't the genders so if you're gonna offer a
          26:49
      program and you want students that are going to do college-level work you're going to get more students who are
          26:55
      eligible for your program if you're offering it for men for because there's
          27:00
      more men so there's often not programs for women so we just and it's me and Rosie and is it answered he said it
          27:07
      differently me and Rosie started a writing workshop
          27:13
      for women at Lemon Creek and our first class was two weeks ending to tell you this our first class was two weeks ago
          27:19
      and we had eight women come to classes we spent an hour and a half and you know I was saying we would be successful if
          27:25
      we had two women show up and and and we stayed for an hour and a half we had eight women we read some poetry we did
          27:32
      some writing in class they got notebooks they went back I went in for our second class on Monday and we had fifteen women
          27:38
      which is all the women's that are which is amazing so it's just I mean it speaks
          27:46
      to the the need for this type of thing and the desire for it and I mean we were
          27:52
      in there for two hours talking about poetry bantering with the education
          27:57
      coordinators and just offering a different atmosphere that is like
          28:03
      intellectual and academic and yet still playful and accessible which which is
          28:09
      which is what flying University does - that's awesome mm-hmm yeah and real quick could you describe
          28:15
      area when 11x and how that's structured because it's different yeah area 111 X is different so I came
          28:21
      down to Juneau last summer after being in Fairbanks for a number of years and
          28:26
      while I was in Fairbanks we had a women's writing workshop up in Fairbanks that's been around now for
          28:31
      almost four years and for about a year we've had area 111 X and that's offering
          28:40
      writing 111 X which is a ger at UAF is it the same designator here yeah it's a
          28:46
      ger it's sort of a gateway course and we in Fairbanks are offering that course for
          28:54
      credit inside their banks Correctional Center and taking this and and that actually came
          29:00
      out of my position at UAF eCampus as an instructional designer
          29:07
      UAF eCampus used to also be distance education and offer correspondence
          29:13
      courses and so was actually providing higher education opportunities inside jails and prisons across the state
          29:20
      through mail but for a number of reasons one being that it's not the best way to
          29:26
      learn they stopped offering those courses and when UAF stopped offering paper-based
          29:32
      courses a lot of people lost access to higher education in the jail's so this
          29:38
      was an effort to put that access back in place but it's a it's we're calling it
          29:46
      like a hybrid learning approach and it's a hard to explain actually I mean it's
          29:52
      much like flying University in that it's a college-level course there's but it's because Fairbanks Correctional Center is
          29:59
      a jail and not a prison and people rotate through more it's put into smaller bite-sized chunks so that people
          30:05
      can join the course do a part of it be gone for a while come back do more of it
          30:11
      get out finish the course outside and get credit and get access to the university that way so again like like
          30:19
      it said um when LC wasn't up here
          30:24
      responding to the context of the community you're in so that that's a program that's really designed for the
          30:31
      context of a of a of a temporary facility yeah it's pretrial facility
          30:38
      three times yeah excellent yeah and and you that that documentary is a few years
          30:45
      old by now because last semester and the semester before I was able to offer
          30:51
      college credit so that was really exciting two semesters ago it was philosophy 201 for students got credit
          30:58
      for that and then this semester it was writing 111 five students enrolled when
          31:04
      ended up in the hole but for 60s this s for the best so so
          31:09
      you know that's not bad four out of five and yeah so so yeah maybe we'll sort of keep this
          31:18
      conversation going and bring in some outside perspectives I want to invite
          31:27
      Blake Fletcher he's here and Kevin Jones and we'll Geiger and Ricky on Alito to
          31:36
      join us on the panel questions for go away Blake was so yeah these are flying
          31:55
      University rock stars here right now the
          32:00
      actually the topic the seminar topic this semester is philosophy of community and that's organized around a direct
          32:07
      independent study I'm doing with Kevin and then we'll Geiger is a longtime ally
          32:15
      of the fine University I like I just like to say that the first time I ever
          32:20
      stepped foot in a classroom at UAS as a professor will was in that class that is
          32:25
      the students I've known will since I my first class yeah it's rad and then Ricky on Ally
          32:33
      know most everybody knows Rick he's well networked person in the community he's a
          32:39
      he's a he's got a crazy awesome story I love to get together with him and just
          32:47
      hear some of his his crazy stories but in the prison he's affectionately known as og everybody called him og for a long
          32:56
      time and then one night he was he was talking and I don't know what og means
          33:01
      and I was like he said I think it means old guys no no no it means original gangster
          33:13
      and then Blake pleasure as a great ally of the fine University he was our first
          33:19
      flying University intern last spring semester and for as part of his
          33:24
      internship he started a an oral history of flying university so he did interviews with inside students outside
          33:31
      students some of our guests faculty who have shown up Robert walls or justin hays Emily wall and so yeah we're very
          33:40
      grateful for that so I wanted to ask you all and if you forget the questions are
          33:45
      behind you I didn't think that they would be behind you though but just maybe sort of talk
          33:52
      about how or when did you participate in flying university do you have a particularly memorable moment how did
          34:00
      the seminar impact you and what do you want others to know about your experience with flying you and we can
          34:07
      start with Kevin we don't have to necessarily go in order this is a panel discussion so I started with finding
          34:13
      University last semester was the first time I went in I was in one of Saul's classes and uni was actually asking for
          34:19
      volunteers and I just think this is the place we live and it's important that
          34:25
      our community that we know our community and be a part of the community and you
          34:32
      know thinking about the prison it's like that's something that I don't know anything about I he we actually have a
          34:39
      family member who went to the prison system because of something stupid that was done and I thought this is important
          34:47
      so I started going in last semester went in with was very apprehensive because I
          34:54
      had no idea what I was walking into and when you walk into the prison and you know the security checks and then the
          35:01
      door slams from the gates point this gate opens gate closes then you go up and I think last semester we had 12
          35:08
      mm-hmm inside students you walk into this room and there are 12 men and very
          35:17
      very diverse you know some things that we consider
          35:23
      you know hate symbols tattooed on my bodies and things so but I quickly realized how anticipated this us coming
          35:34
      in there was for them what an amazing opportunity of how grateful they were that we were actually taking the time to
          35:41
      go in there and be with them that's like wow these people and then you start
          35:49
      talking and you you become friends with these guys and every time they see you they I was amazed they remembered your
          35:56
      name so here all these people and they knew every one of our names right after the first time and they don't feel like
          36:07
      they're part of the cube feel very very externalized and like nobody cares and
          36:13
      you hear that a lot of times well nobody really cares and so the preparedness of
          36:20
      everything the intensity with which they go through what we're doing is just it's amazing and you know last semester was
          36:29
      the first day that I knew about the thing we're getting headed and it wasn't just the five or the four that were
          36:36
      actually getting credit but when they actually completed the course and everything every single those 12 guys
          36:42
      was excited because it was something you know that life-changing
          36:49
      so I just and I'm going in again this semester it's just an amazing experience
          37:00
      I started going into the flying university the first semester he said
          37:06
      it's been six and a half years the first four I haven't made it to the last two
          37:14
      and a half since I started working full-time but yeah like what Kevin said
          37:21
      the the joyfulness in the classroom is something that I I've always really been
          37:28
      first of all struck by but then what it made me want to keep returning and
          37:36
      to do away with the conception that is there sometimes even though we explicitly cast it aside that we're
          37:44
      going in to help these people but it's a communal learning experience but it
          37:50
      would always be a really invigorating intellectual exercise no matter what the
          37:56
      readings were which were often you know very diverse but and very complex but
          38:04
      everyone would get really deep into the material as if it were a class at any
          38:12
      university and there'd be people would be held to relatively high standards
          38:17
      which i think is part of what Sol's trying to do with an experience for
          38:23
      college preparedness that a lot of people haven't experienced before couple positive experiences I can recall
          38:31
      one was like in the video I was wearing a yellow shirt that we affectionately
          38:36
      took termed solidarity yellow one time
          38:41
      they were doing their account and they accidentally counted at a conference or
          38:55
      something so I actually got to lead the course and I don't remember what the
          39:01
      material was but we were going in to the first right outside where the barbed
          39:06
      wire fences and they asked who I was and I remember exactly what I said but once
          39:12
      they they asked if I had my credentials and I said yes
          39:27
      [Laughter]
          39:37
      sort of playful but I'm not quite sure the best terms to put playful humor and
          39:46
      solidarity like they would give me a really hard time when I was standing in as a substitute teacher but it's in a
          39:52
      really uplifting friendly way where they're they're making jokes at my defense in a way that tells me we're
          39:59
      here for you and so just those those really human connections but also just
          40:05
      firm even my own personal benefit from engaging its material it's every every
          40:13
      class I've attended has been really enriching where people didn't wear
          40:25
      tattoos you know my first class I wanted and people were really covered in tattoos I didn't know about thing Wow
          40:33
      and within the third class I didn't see any tattoos anymore I saw people it was
          40:42
      very emotional for me to see that film because I know all these guys very very well and and I have great affection for
          40:49
      all of them and when people get out I walk a lot and so I I meet people and I
          40:56
      met one guy who participated fully in the class and I took him out to lunch
          41:02
      and I try to do that just connection to community because if people are our community whether people wanted to say
          41:09
      that but those folks are very much part of my community emotionally and every
          41:15
      other way and he said I'm from I'm from
          41:21
      Kodiak one fisherman and I'm walk I
          41:26
      don't you know they just dropped me out here I'm gonna halfway house but I I walk around I I don't know where I'm at
          41:33
      and by the way I I can't read and I said have you ever been able to read he said
          41:38
      no since a little kid so I was gonna connect him with special ed services and stuff you know
          41:44
      we have but here it was and he participated in that class fully because
          41:51
      folks in that community read to him and explained to him so he could understand
          41:56
      just like anybody else with a disability he functioned fully I had no idea he
          42:02
      couldn't read and he can you imagine how
          42:07
      scary it is if you can't read doesn't do the FES clinic and I worked with Jamie I
          42:15
      was on the board for many years and so I knew a lot of people in jail and I know the hardest guys some of the hardest
          42:22
      people who go there because they don't understand what's happening and it's very emotional to see that there is a
          42:29
      beautiful community there it's a very harsh environment it's it's not a easy
          42:34
      environment but they told us the first time the first class was the most
          42:40
      powerful from they all have been powerful of course but they they said
          42:54
      anyway getting a little emotional here but they said this is such as something
          43:03
      like I would just as a sacred space that's how I describe it it's a sacred
          43:08
      we're safe here you guys share with us like you heard you share with us we
          43:14
      share with you we have a level of respect and affection and we care about it we know we all care about each other
          43:20
      we don't get that in here it's a scary place this place and at the last I've
          43:26
      told you about the the tattoos you know what might generate and the last one
          43:32
      they said you guys are special to us and they started pulling up they can't take their shirts off so he would pull him up
          43:39
      show us the tattoos explain what the tattoos meant and all of a sudden it
          43:44
      became this is art like stained glass windows telling us who what my life is
          43:50
      about and it had a whole different and I met a man in Provence his body was 96% here for 90
          43:57
      I'm covered in tattoos II said and some of you were there no I'm talking and he's he got through there's some basic
          44:06
      education and he said my mom was a pusher my dad was a pusher my mom was a
          44:13
      prostitute I didn't know people didn't sell drugs I didn't know anything about this and I came to prison God didn't
          44:20
      educate I began to understand something would you switch over here is here and
          44:26
      they lifted up their shirts you were there and so I have a very I'm very
          44:44
      connected and I've been in every class there is I go I enrolled in there is
          44:50
      this this is a special part of the community I want to be a part of it's
          44:56
      hard to follow oh dear it's so the first time that I
          45:05
      considered going into the flying university was Saul's English 215 class
          45:11
      and so English 215 is kind of a big deal
          45:16
      and when you get into the philosophy and behind literature and you get into
          45:21
      looking deeper in ways of actually reading so that you can be moved by the literature that you read and Saul
          45:29
      offered to us one day actually it was almost more like a plead I don't know like and and I like I could hear the
          45:35
      passion in his voice and he said hey I have this opportunity for you and this opportunity wouldn't tell you to have a
          45:42
      time commitment on Friday afternoons you're gonna need to come in you're going to need to have done some extra reading you'll get a second look at a
          45:48
      lot of the literature I'll write you a letter of recommendation here's the opportunity I would like it for you to
          45:54
      come and participate in the class that I teach in the prison and for me I didn't
          46:02
      hesitate I raised my hand before Saul had even finished describing what would
          46:07
      this would entail and I said what time on Friday so I want to see if I have class and so the reason I was so quick to make
          46:14
      that to make that leap to go ahead and do that is because my dad was in prison
          46:19
      for a little bit while I was a kid for a actually quite a large chunk of my childhood and the thing about my dad was
          46:28
      that he suffered a tremendous loss in right in front of him he was in a car
          46:35
      accident his best friend died in his passenger seat of his car and he was
          46:40
      driving and it was on my first birthday so my dad was 18 years old when that
          46:47
      happened and he fell apart he told me sometime along that at some sort of a
          46:55
      get-together with friends somebody offered him some sort of a substance and he didn't even remember what and he
          47:01
      tried it and his friend just said it'll make your pain go away it'll make it so that you won't have to think about these
          47:06
      things anymore and it's stuck in it it only really takes one time sometimes for
          47:12
      it to really grab hold of somebody but that's not why we're here today what
          47:18
      we're here today to talk about is why I wanted to do that and so my dad when he got out he worked really hard and he
          47:24
      raised me to respect every person that I meet and never to assume that I am
          47:30
      better than anybody because we all have struggles and we all have flaws and one
          47:36
      thing in particular he taught me is that we all make mistakes we share that in common we all make mistakes and the
          47:42
      severity of those mistakes Barry I asked my dad one day what was the best days
          47:49
      for you in prison like what was the the best part and I was hoping for kind of a selfish response when I was a kid I
          47:55
      thought he would say you coming to see me of course but what he actually said
          48:00
      was different he said to be honest I think he want me to say you coming in and visiting me but those were the
          48:06
      hardest days and he said the easiest days were the days that people would come in and play Monopoly or checkers or
          48:14
      have a book club or teach a class or have a religious service or those types
          48:21
      of events because in those moments he encountered strange but those strangers would look him in
          48:27
      the face and those strangers would look him and they would meet his gaze and he
          48:32
      said it made him feel human and so what I thought Saul was offering me was the opportunity to go and maybe try to make
          48:39
      some other people feel human that could use that in their lives but what I got
          48:44
      out of it was a tremendous amount more than I anticipated because well Geiger was there and saw me
          48:54
      Lee was there an OG Rick was there and every day when we showed up it was like some sort of a holiday because you walk
          49:01
      in and you get dapped up in hugs and you get like the largest hug from the
          49:06
      largest man I've ever seen that kind of hurt but it also felt good because I knew he was hugging me that hard because
          49:12
      he cared and so I had so many supports from that class whether it be to engage
          49:18
      with the literature in a deeper level and to ask questions and get perspectives that I would never
          49:24
      otherwise be able to get and like I said with will being there this guy is a
          49:30
      pretty smart dude that has done some serious reading and committed some time to thinking about these things like saul
          49:36
      has and to be able to ask him questions on the side a I have a misunderstanding and then to have that be a part of a
          49:42
      group discussion with people who had different opinions than me I was able to learn and so that's not what I
          49:49
      anticipated I didn't anticipate I was going to go in there and learn I thought I was going in there and doing a service to these people but and honestly they
          49:56
      did a service to me and I'll share one more experience with you before I passed this on because I don't want to hog the
          50:02
      mic but the first day of that class I think somebody else said this earlier
          50:08
      was kind of overwhelming I was sitting in the parking lot and I'd spent a fair
          50:14
      amount of time in my childhood visiting a prison every Thursday to see my dad and I was like literally shaking in my
          50:21
      car and I was looking at the gates and I was just like reliving memories that I don't want to think about and
          50:28
      walking through those gates walking through the sliding gates to get in there the very ones that will almost had
          50:34
      his credentials checked at why through those gates like my mind was flooded with emotion and feelings that I
          50:41
      had suppressed since I was probably 10 or 12 years old and then I got up to
          50:46
      that class we go through the metal detectors and emptied our pockets out and we finally get up there and I made
          50:54
      sure to sit down in between two inmates because my goal was to look some people in the eyes and the people that needed
          50:59
      to look good or to look in the eyes I thought were the inmates the inside students and the two guys I SAP teen
          51:07
      between were germy fish and coal dupuy and so we end up getting into a breakout
          51:15
      discussion and we're sitting together and before we could even get into really deeper level introductions aside from
          51:21
      here's my name : Dover and he said why are you here why did you come in here
          51:27
      and I said pretty much a short version of what I just told you about my dad and
          51:33
      I said I want to come in here because I want you to know that there are good people out there and that if you do have
          51:38
      the opportunity to get out that people will meet your gaze maybe not everybody but some people will so you have to keep
          51:45
      hope pretty much what's my message and I didn't say it like that because I wasn't trying to like spread a message or
          51:51
      something but I remember his response is what forever like changed my outlook on
          51:57
      the years that I spent separated from my dad because he like leaned back after I told him and he was quiet and then he
          52:05
      said can I ask you something I said sure he said do you hate your father he said
          52:12
      do you hate your father and I just didn't know what to say I was so taken aback that I was pretty
          52:18
      shocked and finally I came around to say no because he's strong and when he got
          52:25
      out he beat heroin addiction and when he got out he taught me that all it takes
          52:31
      is one second one bad decision one mishap one misstep to like throw some
          52:36
      stuff away to throw things that are important to you and so from that moment
          52:41
      forward I had a connection with a lot of the guys in there that I didn't really
          52:46
      understand but for them they were like they're like family me for the years that I've spent at you
          52:53
      I guess so thanks Blake right on
          53:06
      what am i we have a I have a quote here from a former outside student he said
          53:12
      some students go on cultural immersion this is justice immersion taking that
          53:20
      yeah trademark there or something well
          53:28
      thank you all incidentally we have two outside students in the audience right now who are attending for the first time this
          53:34
      semester and Kiran so yeah they get some that we unfortunately this semester
          53:41
      twice they've had the prison administration has canceled class on this one because of they weren't able to
          53:49
      get the background checks done in time to they said the games were malfunctioning last week so he's only
          53:55
      had like two classes so far this semester but I would like to bring up
          54:00
      some of our community advocates now I'd like to invite KJ up here and Rosie and
          54:07
      Christina so Christina love is amazing
          54:30
      and she is part of our lion the Juneau crew it's part of this statewide effort
          54:38
      to develop higher education access in our prisons follow the Juneau drew the Geno cruise is composed of Christina
          54:46
      Kendall now she's the Fairbanks cruise and Rick and Rosie and then Rosie is we
          54:58
      did find University last year last semester and then KJ has been in the
          55:03
      prison has been in been hidden Bob who's been in the fine University one time and
          55:09
      that was two semesters ago he and his wife Peggy were able to come inside on our last day of classes because they had
          55:16
      funded two of our scholarships Northern Lights church funded the other two and then KJ hooked us up with some
          55:25
      scholarship opportunities last semester as well and in fact it's his money that has helped create the fund to find
          55:33
      University funds that we are developing an advertisement for tonight and so for
          55:40
      our community advocates I have two questions why is it important to work
          55:46
      with prison populations as we think about building healthy communities and what compels you toward advocacy for
          55:52
      fine University in our community what other issues is it related to for me it's not so we know it's not just higher
          55:58
      education other issues pull away okay
          56:16
      let me let me let me lead by spirit so
          56:23
      for for me and my experience there a lot of this has been trauma mastery and that
          56:28
      I come from too long generations of families that have been incarcerated I
          56:35
      am Aleut from making ik and I grew up in China and and a lot of both of those
          56:40
      villages were filled with people that struggled with alcohol and suicide and sexual assault and domestic violence and
          56:47
      poverty and homelessness and incarceration and I was 12 years old
          56:52
      when my siblings and I placed my father in jail for sexually abusing us and and
          56:58
      then later in my teens and adolescents and and into adulthood that I was in and out
          57:04
      of incarceration and and I remember being released upon for drug-related
          57:10
      charges and my father had more rights as a as as an offender than I did because
          57:17
      of drug-related charges and so there was part of this it was like there's something gravely wrong with the system
          57:23
      and I remember the last time that you know that I detox in Fairbanks and and I
          57:29
      just remember coming to and we call it the unthaw process the the process of
          57:35
      awakening to the world and feeling emotions and and for me it was starting to see life in color and all of the
          57:42
      different ways that society had thrown me away I could I could explain to you at what point I realized that I was
          57:49
      invisible to the world and at what point I realized that I was disposable and and all of the ways that I felt that
          57:55
      oppression had affected me and and this this journey where I found healing and
          58:02
      liberation through education the more I learned about systems the more I learned about historical and generational trauma
          58:09
      and it was all of this like healing process for me and in part of that healing was that I wanted to make a way
          58:17
      so that the next generation so that my daughter won't have to know that or so that as a community we're aware of
          58:23
      what's happening to people you know what's what's happening to the people that are sleeping under the bridges and what's happening to to people who are
          58:31
      incarcerated and that was that was a big part of it was that people that I had spoken to didn't realize you know well
          58:39
      that that our prisons had become a warehouse for people who are mentally ill who are physically unwell who are
          58:44
      struggling with substances that every woman that I was incarcerated with had been sexually abused from a small age
          58:49
      had survived domestic violence we didn't most people don't know that this is this
          58:55
      is how we respond to people who not only are bark vulnerable but who are targeted
          59:00
      and I'm so part of that part of learning that for myself and that that paradox
          59:07
      that you only keep what you give away is felt really really important and
          59:14
      and it feels important you know to continue to share that information and it feels that I feel like for whatever
          59:21
      reason I don't understand why still to this day you know and I when I walk
          59:28
      downtown and I see people who are sleeping outside I don't understand why I'm in a car and I have the job that I have and I have the life that I have her
          59:34
      why me and not them and why not them and why not yet and but it but it but it
          59:40
      feels very very important that I use the privilege and power that I have to be an extension of their voice and that it
          59:47
      that and I feel that working with with our whole community keeps the issues
          59:55
      relevant you know that you know as right now in the political climate they were in that people understand the unintended
          1:00:02
      consequences of some of these fear-based narratives that are being generated and
          1:00:09
      the very very real consequences of that and and what happens and that you know
          1:00:15
      with one policy results in and many people die you know and and I think that
          1:00:20
      those are stories that don't often penetrate in that their takes there's there's so much we live with in this
          1:00:27
      world but there are many worlds within this world even from poverty to middle-class is a completely different language like Rick was talking about how
          1:00:34
      tattoos tell stories and and how there is just it's just a completely different culture that living in the street or
          1:00:41
      living in poverty or in homelessness and then end to incarceration and and most
          1:00:46
      people don't understand what it takes to to move from that world into our world
          1:00:52
      you know and even into into middle class and there's the battle of getting there and then the battle of sustaining that
          1:00:58
      and it's just it's absolutely incredible and and it's at this this work feels so
          1:01:03
      important it takes on many many different lives of its own but education
          1:01:10
      for me has always been liberation and I know that like even as I'm giving I'm telling you my story you know I've found
          1:01:16
      my finding healing within it as well
          1:01:24
      and so I think kind of jumping off of
          1:01:30
      what Christina said about the privilege when I was convicted of a felony
          1:01:36
      and incarcerated I was incarcerated about a year ago for a couple months and
          1:01:42
      I came from very supported very you know
          1:01:50
      privileged lots of education we know in
          1:01:57
      my family and whatnot and so going into that role for just a tiny bit of time
          1:02:05
      just dipping my toe into the other side for me it was kind of like just running
          1:02:14
      towards a brick wall right you're like you have all of these opportunities and you're doing all of these things in the
          1:02:21
      community and then all of a sudden you do some stupid stuff and then and then what right so when I was released after
          1:02:29
      having been at lemon Creek with the women in the Juliet dorm there I still
          1:02:37
      had support I still had my community you know there were many bridges that I
          1:02:42
      burned but for the most part I mean the main thing that was steadfast in the the
          1:02:48
      most support that I that I had was you is was the faculty and my colleagues and
          1:02:54
      my classmates and the staff here nobody you know people just looked you know
          1:03:03
      they didn't look at me that much different because I was still a student and I was still a classmate or whatnot
          1:03:08
      and so I had known so for I'm sorry I felt a little hoarse but I had known
          1:03:16
      Saul he was my professor a couple years ago when I first started at us and I
          1:03:22
      knew about a flying University it took me about I was released in March and it took me about three months or so like
          1:03:29
      the summer time to really like kind of unpack what it was like to be incarcerated and to have the guilt of
          1:03:34
      like I don't come from I don't come from a place of struggle you know but at the same time
          1:03:41
      you know I've made choices that that created struggle for myself so it took
          1:03:48
      me a little while to unpack it and I I asked Saul I said hey can I be a part of
          1:03:53
      you know flying university and he was he
          1:03:58
      was very very supportive about it and after being incarcerated at lemon Creek
          1:04:04
      just like Kendall was talking about the opportunities for women there and we I
          1:04:11
      mean it's you know it's just space wise and staff wise there's not you know not
          1:04:17
      a lot of space and an opportunity for women here at Lemon Creek to be educated
          1:04:25
      when I was there we had one sex ed class and that that you know the public health
          1:04:31
      center comes quarterly and so for the women that are you know incarcerated for
          1:04:37
      years and years and years you know they're getting the same sex ed class
          1:04:42
      four times a year and that's their only education is you know how to not get an
          1:04:50
      STD and so it's I could from the relationships that I fostered while I
          1:04:55
      was in there and have you know sustained since I've been released like it's it's
          1:05:03
      kind of a like a degrading feeling you know um and like Christina said just
          1:05:09
      being in using your privilege and your you know whatever you may have as an
          1:05:15
      extension of the voices of the you know people that you come to be friends with
          1:05:23
      and and you know bring into your community and you know in your heart I
          1:05:28
      think that that's the main thing that compels me towards advocacy yes I think
          1:05:42
      that one of the most important things that we need to do is move to risk
          1:05:49
      sort of justice system instead of a punitive system and I had hopes with SB
          1:05:56
      91 that that's the way we were headed but it turns out that and we're going in
          1:06:03
      a different direction now and the fact that the governor has declared war on
          1:06:08
      criminals is heartbreaking we're not
          1:06:18
      declaring war on injustice and poverty and a lot of the other reasons that
          1:06:26
      people struggle we're going to be very punitive about it and we're gonna lock
          1:06:33
      people up and we're gonna have to build more prisons and it will probably be run
          1:06:41
      by an international corporation and there's not a lot of restorative effort
          1:06:52
      it's just not the kind of Alaska that I had dreamed about and then I want to be
          1:06:58
      part of and so you have to have a voice you have to and if the voice isn't out
          1:07:05
      there you have to create it and organize other people to understand what's at
          1:07:12
      stake and what has to be done and what
          1:07:18
      has worked and what hasn't worked so and
          1:07:25
      then and I guess the other thing that kind of motivated myself is connections
          1:07:33
      with people I mean I made mistakes in my life and those mistakes
          1:07:40
      I don't believe define who I am and I would imagine that we've all made
          1:07:47
      mistakes and when I talk to inmates and coach them and talk to them I assure
          1:07:54
      them that the worst thing that they've done in their life does not define who they are
          1:08:03
      and they respond to that I mean it's like being treated humanely and that's
          1:08:09
      the nice thing about the flying you that you treat people humanely and his equals
          1:08:15
      and with dignity and that goes a long way in healing people so you know George
          1:08:28
      Brown the physician who passed away seven or eight years ago was a strong
          1:08:35
      advocate of healthy families and he said put the money put the effort in having
          1:08:43
      healthy families and healthy kids and don't save the money to build prisons at
          1:08:51
      the end of their life thank you thank
          1:09:04
      you thank you all yet before we make a
          1:09:12
      couple announcements and wrap things up are there questions or their conversations anybody want to say
          1:09:22
      anything or I thought I'd like just to add one more thing since it's on my mind
          1:09:28
      but you had a question so you go first just a friend of KJZZ unfamiliar with
          1:09:35
      all rkj pitched this project to the
          1:09:53
      local chapter of errands for peace and
          1:09:58
      they see below remote from our central mission opposing militarism and then
          1:10:05
      working for peace I mean I can stir see
          1:10:10
      the connections all our own there right now you know as an organization it's hard to
          1:10:18
      make a connection but someone are a grid that Barron's comprised an outside
          1:10:30
      portions statistically of the incarcerated population am i right let's
          1:10:36
      Jeff starting to see a connection JJ
          1:10:42
      didn't pitch that particular connection but if I can learn a little more I'll
          1:10:48
      pass it on to the folks in our chapter I want to respond yeah thank you for
          1:10:55
      asking the question and commenting there
          1:11:00
      was a man named Michael Alexander there was a man named Michael Alexander I'm wearing hearing aids and I can't hear
          1:11:06
      myself he was in the film in his 60s
          1:11:14
      I hope he's alive I'm not anybody's pretty sick and he's older he was a vet
          1:11:22
      he went in there we playing Othello that you saw my name is the black man in
          1:11:30
      there one of the first classes he said
          1:11:37
      I'm like Othello hmm what I mean by that
          1:11:42
      as I am black I was a teenage soldier I
          1:11:49
      was abused I married somebody of a different race he went and I thought
          1:12:00
      three tours two or three tours in Vietnam front lines survived then they
          1:12:07
      after that he had PTSD he said I'm like Othello I have PTSD and he explained Otello killed everybody because he had
          1:12:13
      PTSD it was part of the dynamic of what was happening he was terribly abused in
          1:12:19
      any way as this man was and
          1:12:24
      they dropped him off in New York and fairly violent area and he had a
          1:12:30
      flashback of pts flashback he'd been killing for years that's what he was the government trained him to do his kills
          1:12:36
      his five and they dropped him in a violent area he apparently killed some people I don't know the exact story and
          1:12:42
      he said now I'm the rest of my life in here this man was a very good man they
          1:12:51
      sent him down to a private prison in Colorado or Utah I can't remember where
          1:12:57
      twice Colorado yeah and he he met it for the first time Bloods and Crips he's an
          1:13:03
      old man by this time and he told him something he said you know you take a
          1:13:09
      wet dream you guys killed more blacks than they do they just loved you well
          1:13:14
      you can imagine how that went over the blood kin Crips it didn't go over these young people too well and in a few days
          1:13:21
      they came back and they said you're right we're making peace and they did
          1:13:27
      and you know what the corrections they said he was a gang leader and they punished him for doing that just just to
          1:13:35
      understand how this system doesn't work and that's are very much part of this very very much part of this yeah thank
          1:13:43
      you though that would be great and
          1:14:05
      sought after in the late 70s early 80s there used to be a program called
          1:14:11
      University behind walls is that what it was Rick and Rick talking to them I've
          1:14:17
      met last November I met the woman who started that program and we were talking
          1:14:23
      about I asked her how did you how did you teach University classes inside lemon Creek with just one tiny writing
          1:14:30
      center with obsolete computers can barely hold ten people
          1:14:36
      and the Learning Center which you saw in the video and she said that between those two classrooms there's a whole
          1:14:43
      bunch of parole office officer offices now and those offices used to be
          1:14:49
      classrooms so there just simply isn't this space to offer too much more it's
          1:14:57
      great that Rosie and Kendall are able to get in and do the women's writing workshop but yeah that's that is
          1:15:04
      something that is sought after and pretty much desired and the prison yeah
          1:15:10
      so it'd be nice to develop that we were like like KJ said we seemed pretty
          1:15:17
      poised did some really promising opportunities and moments before the current administration thank you at like
          1:15:29
      I mean it is possible to start more classes and salih is totally right
          1:15:36
      there's really limited space but they offered Rosie and I two different time slots so we only took one and all I mean
          1:15:47
      this is kind of a plug but we're looking for more teachers and we're looking for
          1:15:53
      women we're working with women and we're only bringing in women so if you're a
          1:15:58
      woman and you can be inspired by writing then you should talk to Rosie or me cuz
          1:16:06
      we need more people okay Monday afternoons for dissing about two hours
          1:16:11
      longer lunch break and if you know any women who like to read or inspired by
          1:16:17
      writing some of them are way too we're trying to build a team of facilitators so that we can grow our writing workshop
          1:16:27
      into something that's really sustainable and hopefully year-round yeah my role as
          1:16:35
      Chancellor I just want to express my gratitude to all of you for sharing your stories and the work that you're doing
          1:16:40
      and to solve for your leadership in this I remember early on when I was first
          1:16:46
      here at UAF you told me of your desire to do this and I thought what a wonderful thing
          1:16:53
      that would be for the community and having lived Island in Fairbanks too and I knew that there was a lot of variation
          1:16:59
      from warden to warden there's no prison official one to another about whether
          1:17:04
      they were supportive of these types of things and I was gratified to learn that you were able to make those entrées and
          1:17:11
      and get this going and you know I think our mission up there has community
          1:17:18
      engagement in it and I can't think of a better example of community engagement than this blind University you just give
          1:17:25
      it one communal thank you very much for being here for the work that you do
          1:17:30
      yeah thanks for being here and Riggs always been so so supportive the joke I like to say is I asked the permission
          1:17:36
      one time well then so we are so our
          1:18:02
      Union United academics negotiated our contracts and one of the features of the
          1:18:08
      new contract was that we had a pool of research money called faculty initiated fund grants and we Sarah Stanley from
          1:18:19
      UAF who started airing one 11x with Kendall reached out to me and said is
          1:18:25
      this something we want to work together on and I said yes and so we put together the application we got our grand money
          1:18:33
      it was really wonderful opportunity and so we created we started networking
          1:18:38
      everyone 11x flying University now we have the women's writing workshop and we
          1:18:45
      created the learning inside out network or lion and the grant money was used to
          1:18:51
      fund to think tanks one in Fairbanks in
          1:18:57
      November and so we took the Juno crew who I mentioned early and that was phenomenal three days a lot
          1:19:04
      of good community networking a lot of great ideas and then in April April 12
          1:19:09
      through 14 we're gonna hope that you know think-tank the Fairbanks think-tank
          1:19:15
      really allowed us to get together to create the network and create an identity and create a brand and these
          1:19:21
      kinds of things and what we're hoping to do in April is actually institutionalize
          1:19:27
      some of these efforts it's kind of difficult in this political climate this
          1:19:32
      political moment you know Kendall mentioned another slot opening up inside
          1:19:39
      lemon Creek well the old do Steve started a program called VIPs and so
          1:19:45
      community members to get credentialed and they could go in and bring their own programming in and I was was that they
          1:19:54
      took that away exactly exactly the judaistic down yeah
          1:19:59
      and I tell you though I like to encourage everybody though is about community tonight
          1:20:06
      to keep pressure where we can and don't let the the current political climate
          1:20:12
      rendered the prison system more invisible I was presented at an
          1:20:17
      acquaintance conference conference in Santa Clara University and at the end of the conference I was talking where the inmates and I said this is amazing here
          1:20:25
      at San Quentin used to be one of the most historically notorious by the prisons in California and today it's the prison that people
          1:20:31
      want to go to because all of the programming and opportunities and he said it had nothing to do with the
          1:20:36
      initiatives of the prison administration had everything to do with community members relentlessly knocking on the doors of the prison so even in this
          1:20:44
      political climate we've got to maintain that kind of pressure but if you're interested in any of this you can
          1:20:51
      register here lion got opened at UAF that media this is our website that's
          1:21:00
      right right that's right yes okay now registration up right now okay but I can
          1:21:05
      put it up tonight the register tomorrow morning
          1:21:11
      designed our logo and she brought a bunch of postcards here tonight so if
          1:21:16
      you want more informations oh yeah it's right there it's right there you really don't have time awesome so so that's
          1:21:24
      that's there as well and then I just want to make the announcement that we
          1:21:30
      have you know we Jesse I work in the
          1:21:51
      Alumni Relations and development office and my colleague Shana O'Sullivan who's our great fundraiser and development
          1:21:58
      officer has been working with Saul to develop the flying university support
          1:22:03
      fund and so that is now ready to go and we're able to take contributions and
          1:22:09
      this is going to really help support not only programming for flying university
          1:22:15
      but it's going to help students or in the form of scholarships and books and
          1:22:21
      other materials and any other expenses and just really provide a great an
          1:22:27
      actual platform to give and to support all of your efforts so we have that we
          1:22:33
      have giving cards in the back if you'd like to interview there's also a mechanism here if you want to you know
          1:22:40
      contribute tonight just texting flying so for one for court for every are you
          1:22:46
      yeah and so I just want to thank all of you I know Shana and all powerful
          1:22:53
      statistic about I just wanted to share with you before we talk but research
          1:22:59
      proves that every dollar invested in correctional education saves nearly five and three incarceration costs over three
          1:23:07
      years so I mean with all of your efforts going in and you know educating our
          1:23:12
      incarcerated community members is just going to pay off so well not only economically for you know our
          1:23:19
      communities but it's just really providing a step forward for all of these incarcerated community members when they
          1:23:26
      get out they have a path forward and they are already hopefully getting some college credit so thank you saw and
          1:23:32
      think everyone all of your work in Lemon Creek and beyond so thank you very much
          1:23:38
      for coming in we support us in any way with your time or any contributions
          1:23:43
      would be appreciated some things I just
          1:23:56
      myself here we go it's all I was gonna say it and I think this is important
          1:24:02
      that this isn't the first flying University and because you told me you
          1:24:08
      talked about the that sort of history and the lineage there oh yeah yeah the
          1:24:18
      original fine University took place and in Czechoslovakia respect that cool yeah
          1:24:29
      it took place in Czechoslovakia and my teacher Margaret to stick was a student across South Havel and yon puto chica in
          1:24:37
      Soviet occupied Czechoslovakia and in 1977 he was a he signed the student
          1:24:44
      signatory of the Charter 717 rights agreement and they used to me for secret philosophy classes and they call
          1:24:51
      themselves by himself and in 1919 78
          1:25:01
      their secret philosophy school of flying university was raided by the police and
          1:25:07
      they were jailed and interrogated and yon patoshik and my teachers teacher died of diet uh of interrogation wounds
          1:25:15
      and so he died a Socratic death he died at the hands of the state for corrupting the youth and so first semester at Klein
          1:25:24
      University we were reading Havel we were reading 11 oz free reading these folks and talking about that history and the
          1:25:31
      next semester my teacher Marta to stick I brought him to UAS as part of the spring Honor symposium and he and his wife Patricia Huntington
          1:25:37
      went into the prison with us and the guys are all really excited to meet them and asked it if we could name what we
          1:25:43
      were doing in the prison the fine University and he is a student of the original fine University said absolutely
          1:25:50
      I give my complete support to this because it is a direct continuation and it shares a direct genealogy with the
          1:25:56
      original flying University so yeah that's a fun story
          1:26:03
      [Music] all right well contact me if you need any information and thank you all so
