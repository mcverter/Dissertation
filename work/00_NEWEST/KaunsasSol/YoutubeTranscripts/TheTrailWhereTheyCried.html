        0:02
    and uh you should all have gotten the prompt that you are being recorded but we are
        0:08
    recording this um as part of our push to increase our membership we think that we're a
        0:15
    fantastic organization and we hope that you feel the same way um
        0:20
    one of the benefits to membership is access to the recordings for all of the presentations that are being given
        0:26
    during this conference if you haven't checked already to see the fantastic lineup of
        0:33
    uh presentations keynote speeches that are being given for the rest of this month
        0:38
    and also in november please do and i might ask that somebody
        0:44
    post uh a link to the schedule in the chat um i think that we're able to use the chat
        0:51
    feature um we will have a question and answer period at the end and um we'll try to
        0:58
    make that available for people to ask their questions but if you want to you know write them out you could send it to
        1:05
    me in the chat or you could just post it in the chat and we'll try to make sure we get to that stuff
        1:10
    um the peace and justice studies association is
        1:16
    um it's really important organization to me it is the north american um affiliate to
        1:23
    the international peace research association um i encourage membership in both
        1:29
    i think it's particularly special because we're not just scholars talking about
        1:34
    things we're um we're scholars and activists and we're
        1:41
    trying to get stuff done um we're putting our feet on the ground we're putting our energies into places
        1:47
    where they're really important and in terms of the thinking
        1:52
    between myself uh michelle collins sibley and pushpa air who have been responsible for
        1:59
    this october programming one of the things that was most important to us was to really elevate
        2:06
    the stories and really get to the part where the personal and the political intersect
        2:12
    um it's it's not just because it's a pedagogical best practice that our
        2:17
    stories are which influence hearts and minds which is is true and we want to change
        2:24
    people but because there's something about conferences where the reason we go is actually for the conversations we
        2:30
    have in hallways and being in this virtual space of having a conference where
        2:36
    we don't get to like really meet each other in those kinds of spaces it's in
        2:42
    connecting through the story that that's really important there's no way i can describe that that
        2:48
    is both literally and metaphorically more important than the connection between me and the presenter that we'll
        2:54
    get today um you've had a chance to hear but it really was through one of our
        3:00
    attendees organizing a philosophy club where we would get together and have something to
        3:06
    drink and talk about like what are the deeper implications of poetry and
        3:12
    is rage against the machine too political um stuff like that that me and saul neely
        3:18
    got to meet each other before either of us i think had dreams of becoming doctors ourselves
        3:24
    um but the bigger part of the presentation he's going to give is something that i
        3:30
    watched through the virtual world and the moment that i had the chance to say
        3:35
    i want you to present your auto by your auto ethnography at our conference next year he was like i'm all in and here we
        3:44
    are it's happening it's just not happening in florida um so
        3:49
    without further ado i have a land acknowledgement again as part of our recognition that
        3:56
    happens in the peace and justice studies association we like to acknowledge the
        4:02
    land upon which we reside we express our gratitude and appreciation to those who
        4:07
    lived and worked here before us those whose stewardship and resilient spirit makes our residents possible on
        4:15
    this traditional homeland uh where i'm currently residing
        4:22
    um shawnee wyandotte miami ottawa
        4:27
    padawatomi and other great lakes tribes once resided
        4:32

        4:39

        4:45
    1795 during the treaty of greenville by 1100 chiefs and warriors

    sio nagata chalagi gadi soli
        5:21
    saul nealy dagudo
        5:42
    hello everyone uh welcome uh to uh the the presentation my name is
        5:49
    saul neely and um i'm very happy to be here uh i really
        5:55
    appreciate the the confluence here of of colleague and former teacher with jeff paris
        6:03
    who i first met 20 years ago as an undergraduate i did the national student exchange program
        6:09
    from university of alaska anchorage i went to cal state university bakersfield and uh something magical happened there
        6:16
    and something that actually changed uh changed my life uh forever um
        6:23
    and uh you know you you make these connections and you have a professor like uh jeff paris here who
        6:30
    uh just gives everything to the student to enable success
        6:35
    um i just want to say real quick when i did my phd at purdue university's philosophy and literature
        6:42
    phd program which is where jeff got his phd as well and i was accepted in 2004
        6:47
    without any funding uh jeff came up to give a keynote presentation at a conference i organized
        6:53
    in 2004 and he left and within a week of him leaving i got a call from purdue
        6:58
    with full funding um so i don't know what kind of magic uh jeff paris worked for me but
        7:04
    it was it was brilliant i'm forever grateful for that um and that's where i had an opportunity
        7:10
    to meet wim and uh you know we were back in the day we were sort of radical and a little bit naughty
        7:17
    as students and it was fun um but it's a real delight to be here and
        7:23
    i'm glad you all could make it i hope there won't be too many glitches with the technology i do have a powerpoint
        7:28
    i'll start up here in a minute delivering a keynote address via zoom is kind of a strange
        7:35
    phenomenon i think but i'm glad we can do this and i'm really grateful for this opportunity i also appreciate the fact
        7:41
    that wynn gave his land acknowledgement like that i think these
        7:46
    acknowledgments uh which are becoming increasingly more
        7:52
    popular and and uh and whatnot i just think they're important but i think you know
        7:58
    they perform more than simply speaking healing words i think they carry within them the imperative for real political
        8:05
    processing real economic material and phenomenological decolonization
        8:12
    so i'd like to sort of echo that with with three land acknowledgements uh briefly um one thinking about cherokee
        8:19
    north carolina and what is today called the southeast united states which is the ancestral uh territory of
        8:26
    of the cherokee people where my ancestors had their land stolen from them
        8:32
    i'm going to talk about the trail of tears journey i took in the summer of 2019 with my father and my daughter
        8:38
    and i went back in november of 2019 to cherokee north carolina western north
        8:44
    carolina to do some more sabbatical research where i got to an opportunity to work
        8:49
    with and meet sarah snyder brett riggs ben steer they're all brilliant cherokee
        8:54
    studies faculty members at western carolina university i had an
        8:59
    opportunity to meet a renowned cherokee elder tom belt
        9:05
    trey adcock who does directs the cherokee studies program at university of north carolina asheville
        9:11
    michael crowe nathan bush who who made this gorget that i'm wearing sky samson
        9:17
    barbara duncan and who introduced me to bullet standing gear so these were a
        9:22
    constellation of people who i had opportunity to work with and meet on sabbatical
        9:28
    and then i also like to think about and acknowledge tahlequah oklahoma
        9:34
    which is where my family well after the trail of tears comes from um but really
        9:39
    prior to my sabbatical research and prior to the genealogy i've been doing with my
        9:44
    ancestors over the past three years really our family's origin story began with
        9:50
    tahlequah and thinking about people there who have influenced me and
        9:56
    who have inspired me i think about my cherokee language professor ed fields david kornsilk
        10:03
    my cousin kevin seidner and all of my cherokee nation scholar
        10:08
    colleagues and then third even though i'm in ellensburg washington right now
        10:14
    i spent the last eleven years on shingen ani the ancestral lands of the klingon people at university of alaska southeast
        10:21
    a place that i absolutely adore my daughter was born there who's 10 years old now
        10:27
    and i never wanted to leave chiang gerani but some of you might be apprised of
        10:33
    what the current governor of alaska who is funded by the koch brothers and is a friend of donald trump
        10:40
    waged just reckless war against our state economy and our university system
        10:45
    and the day that the day before or the day the day that i uh
        10:52
    accepted the position at heritage university on the yakima nation um
        10:57
    there was a real concern the board of regents at that time for university of alaska was looking to consolidate our
        11:03
    university into uaf which would have killed all of our programs and tenure doesn't mean anything and all of
        11:08
    that so i still feel like i'm rooted there and chingadani and i'd like to to thank
        11:15
    some folks there ishmael hope uh my good colleague lance twitchell ernestine hayes uh luis
        11:22
    brady from sitka alaska kixa d clan david katzek will geiger and and nawaya
        11:29
    these are people who i think um it's imperative for me to acknowledge um thinking about land acknowledgement
        11:35
    and people acknowledgement because it's the genealogy uh that's informed most of my thinking here uh and then finally uh
        11:43
    this morning in preparation for this talk um my daughter and i took a sunrise walk to the top of rattlesnake dance
        11:50
    ridge and we sang a song to all of these places um she uh brought her drum up and
        11:57
    we we're sitting at the top of the ridge and we face shane garani and then we're turning and we're singing as well to
        12:04
    our ancestral homelands in western carolina uh southeast united states and
        12:10
    oklahoma um and of course i'm i'm now working from the traditional lands of the yakima
        12:15
    people which was a nation forged by treaty in 1855 as a confederation of 14
        12:21
    distinct tribal entities and cultures so those land acknowledgements
        12:27
    and people acknowledgements are important it's i think it's a part a very important part of indigenous protocol
        12:34
    and i'm honored and excited to offer this keynote presentation for the peace and studies association especially for
        12:40
    october for which the theme is story and social justice i'm happy to be here not only to talk
        12:46
    about this transformative and restorative journey that i took during the late summer of 2019 with my
        12:53
    dad and my daughter but also because it's really my principal specialty thinking
        12:58
    about the relationship of story and social justice one of my favorite books to teach to
        13:04
    undergraduate students is thomas king's the truth about stories and what she reiterates the truth about stories is
        13:11
    it's all we are and i really think that our present
        13:17
    political crisis or crises is the consequence of an utterly and
        13:22
    radically impoverished political imagination that is both the product and the
        13:28
    modality of settler colonialism settler colonialism bears within it a
        13:35
    radically impoverished political imagination that is the consequence of a radical
        13:42
    radically impoverished relationship to story all right so i think we suffer an
        13:47
    impoverished political imagination because we have an impoverished sense of story and that impoverished sense of story is been the case in western
        13:54
    literary imagination ever since plato kicked the storytellers out of his ideal republic
        14:00
    um you know in in in case i know we have some philosophers in here but um
        14:06
    you know even though it's so common to think about the different starting points between plato and aristotle which
        14:12
    are real and distinct of course i think together what they've done is they've um
        14:18
    they've they've created uh a hierarchicalization of sacralization of philosophy over stories
        14:24
    so plato kicks the poets kicks the storytellers out of his ideal republic aristotle comes along and says well
        14:31
    basically we don't have to kick them out we just have to learn how to read them correctly and so he writes his poetics
        14:37
    and you know once you start getting into indigenous oral literary traditions
        14:42
    or you start to think about uh other literary traditions that were never conditioned by aristotle you really look
        14:49
    to aristotle's poetics and just see how awful it is i mean it's it's just in
        14:54
    terms of thinking about story i tell my students that aristotle writes poetics
        14:59
    as a way of telling you how to read but really what he's giving you is a way not to read um
        15:05
    and uh and i think what this this relationship between plato and aristotle uh it establishes in the western
        15:12
    literary imagination what foucault calls an ontology of truth i get this i get
        15:17
    this phrase from michel foucault but i use it towards different ends but i like the phrase a lot and i really
        15:24
    think that all of western literary imagination from aristotle to matthew arnold is characterized
        15:30
    by this ontology of truth which is to say we've always read literature from the point of view of
        15:37
    philosophy since plato without really recognizing the fact that philosophy was always historically and
        15:45
    epistemologically a moment within the literary so ever since plato we think about
        15:50
    stories a moment within the philosophical we think about the literary as a moment within the philosophical
        15:56
    um but that's not true historically or epistemologically um
        16:02
    and as you see i mean you see this even in plato's republic right when he uses all sorts of literary devices and
        16:08
    techniques in order to make the case why we must banish the storytellers right he talks about the metaphor of the sun the
        16:15
    analogy of the divided line the allegory of the cave he's got the myth of medals
        16:20
    which introduces the idea of the noble lie um and then at the end in book 10 of the republic we get you know in in the final
        16:26
    banishing of the storytellers um except those who will serve the state of course um you know we get this logo central
        16:34
    centrism the sacralization of logocentrism that is predicated on the abjection of
        16:39
    women um and you know so i this is where i think daradah is right all logos and
        16:44
    since logocentrism has always been a foul logo centrism i mean really think about that from the
        16:50
    first moment uh in which western philosophy privileges logos
        16:57
    it is predicated and articulated against women from the beginning there's never an appeal and as far as i know in
        17:02
    western philosophical tradition to logocentrism that's not from the beginning predicated against women
        17:10
    and then not only do we get logocentrism though but we get the uh i think today what we see
        17:15
    particularly in scientific traditions is the persistence of positivism
        17:21
    and positivism in in my line of work has been really problematic for a couple of reasons and
        17:28
    i'll just give you one anecdote real quick about that having spent 11 years on shrinked annie
        17:35
    clinket call indigenous colleagues and i were working to get an alaska native ecological knowledge class
        17:41
    uh passed as a ger for non-science majors now you gotta understand uas university alaska southeast has a 20
        17:48
    uh native uh student body right and so um
        17:54
    the the natural science faculty uh all of whom were not indigenous came
        17:59
    back and said no because it wasn't scientific enough and it's not scientific enough because
        18:05
    it can't be accounted for through this very restricted notion of positivism
        18:11
    and so again i think that that's a very impoverished understanding of science and so i ended up picking up
        18:17
    ethnoscience as an interest mostly because of you know this effort to try to to bring
        18:23
    uh traditional ecological knowledge into our our science programs
        18:28
    um and then just in terms of thinking about um
        18:34
    uh you know the impoverished political imagination that we're suffering i mean we can think about this in terms of the
        18:40
    justice and the in the prison industrial complex um you know
        18:45
    i know i mean this it's a it's an interesting coincidence right i mean jeff paris wim and myself um we've all
        18:51
    taught in prisons in 2012 i started a prison education program called flying university
        18:57
    that brought university students into the prison and again the prison was lemon creek correctional center in genoa alaska
        19:04
    where we have an over-representation of indigenous people statewide alaska native uh people make
        19:11
    up about 17 of the state population but they make up uh 37
        19:17
    of our prison population um and so uh but you know
        19:23
    this whole idea of retributive justice this whole idea of the prison industrial complex these are not indigenous in
        19:29
    origin and they are extensions of subtler colonialism in the same way that we can think about um and actually i get
        19:36
    this from i got this from jeff a long time ago i remember one day at a conference um i forget which conference
        19:42
    this was but um jeff had made the comment that the answer to the problem of the prison
        19:48
    industrial complex is always more prison right i'll never forget the time that jeff said that at a conference and
        19:54
    that's the point right because we have we lack an unbelief we just we just lack the political imagination to think
        19:59
    otherwise than the prison industrial complex um and the same is true with uh climate
        20:05
    change and and environmental degradation we have to see climate change as an extension of subtler colonialism just as
        20:12
    the prison complex is an extension of settler colonialism um and so the problems we're at today i
        20:19
    think um are are tied to this fact that we cannot imagine
        20:24
    otherwise and we can't imagine otherwise because we don't have a rich enough sense of story um
        20:30
    and i think uh you know one of the things that we get and i'm just going to set this up before i get into the story one of the things
        20:36
    that we get through the western uh literary imagination is a notion of truth that's tied to epistemology
        20:42
    right so plato says this in book 10 of the republic he says poetry is ruinous to those who hear it unless as an
        20:48
    antidote they have the precise knowledge of the originals the precise knowledge of the originals
        20:55
    right and so the greek word for origin of course is our key we get um this uh
        21:02
    precise knowledge so that everything becomes um secondary to the
        21:07
    epistemological project and through the through my work on my dissertation i became interested in
        21:12
    literary traditions that never passed through the school of aristotle and i was looking at two primarily um i did i
        21:18
    ended up doing three years of jewish studies at purdue university with sandra goodheart because and i became very interested in
        21:25
    jewish ways of reading uh called midrash midrashic rabbinic ways of reading that never passed through the school of
        21:31
    aristotle and then the other was native american literature and in my dissertation in
        21:37
    contrast to this notion of an ontology of truth that plato sets up truth which is tied to epistemology as i
        21:44
    noted and and and is rooted in this appeal to archie the orig the original form
        21:49
    um i i termed the i coined the term ontology of story um and
        21:55
    an ontology of story understands that whereas within a platonic aristotelian
        22:01
    ontology of truth ethics is always secondary to knowledge it's always a moment within the epistemological but
        22:09
    within an ontology of story um the the epistemological concerns about knowledge
        22:15
    are a moment within the ethical um and so you can sort of see if you
        22:20
    know if any of you are familiar with the work of emmanuel levanos i became really fascinated by levanos
        22:26
    notion of ethics as first philosophy and his notion of midrash and i began to see
        22:31
    some structural parallels between uh oral indigenous oral literary traditions
        22:36
    uh and midrashic rabbinic uh traditions which i'm happy to talk more about later
        22:42
    on or in q a um but yeah so i've been thinking for a
        22:48
    long time about this relationship between uh story and social justice
        22:53
    and i'll go ahead and start sharing my my powerpoint here
        23:03
    let's see you can folks see that all right
        23:08
    um great thanks all right so um so that's a sort of a a
        23:15
    theoretical framework for uh what i'm going to talk about tonight which isn't going to be so theoretically
        23:21
    heavy don't worry um but i tonight's presentation will feature some stories uh which emerge
        23:28
    from a blend of memoir critical theory and philosophy and most of this presentation is like i said before
        23:34
    rooted in my sabbatical research and travels that i undertake during the fall 2019 semester
        23:39
    at uas um and uh
        23:45
    you know if i was pressed to identify a genre for this presentation it would be
        23:51
    auto ethnography as wim said earlier um and so what is auto ethnography right so
        23:58
    i got i got two definitions here of auto ethnography that i like and i'll just read them one says
        24:04
    it is a qualitative research in which an author uses self-reflection and writing
        24:09
    to explore anecdotal and personal experience and connect this autobiographical story to wider cultural
        24:16
    political and social meanings and understandings here's another one i like
        24:22
    autoethnography is an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyze
        24:29
    personal experience in order to understand cultural experience this approach challenges canonical ways
        24:36
    of doing research and representing others and treats research as a political socially just and socially
        24:43
    conscious act a researcher uses tenets of autobiography and ethnography to do and
        24:49
    write auto ethnography thus as a method autoethnography is both process and
        24:54
    product and i hadn't actually thought to describe my sabbatical research in those
        25:00
    terms until i corresponded with whim he reached out to me as one of the editors of peace chronicle
        25:06
    you know to to ask if i would contribute an auto ethnographic essay for the journal on my trello tears journal a
        25:13
    journey and i realized that autoethnography is exactly what i'm doing here
        25:18
    and the coincidence of the personal and the existential with the political and the cultural
        25:23
    is one that i usually adopt anyway and i owe that tendency to some of my graduate professors
        25:29
    including mark matustic who i know jeff paris worked and sandra goodheart
        25:34
    both of whom encouraged this braiding of concern in their critical theory and philosophical practice
        25:41
    and for years i've privileged the vocabulary of genealogy because it offers us not just history
        25:47
    but as michel foucault writes a history of the present genealogy is always already storied it
        25:53
    is situated adopts a perspective remains open to interpretation and it's always
        25:59
    in a state of becoming we have our personal genealogies and we have our cultural and political
        26:05
    genealogies autoethnography provides a methodology for reading those personal cultural and
        26:11
    political genealogies through each other rendering various aspects of our auto
        26:16
    ethnographic work more or less legible depending on the apertures through which
        26:22
    we focus our attention and i'm going to talk more about that at the very end that's why i like the second definition
        26:29
    of auto ethnography as both process and product we are reminded that every one of us has
        26:34
    a story even as none of us are reducible to our histories
        26:40
    and when we adopt such an approach we realize that the quality of our relations
        26:45
    is is not the quality of our relations
        26:53
    is not uniquely occasioned by what we intend we can approach our work from
        26:59
    intentional consciousness but we must remain open to that which comes to us from beyond ourselves we
        27:06
    must remain open to revelation things and relations that do not have their origin within our idiosyncratic
        27:13
    intentions and this was certainly true during our journey on the trail of tears when we
        27:20
    experienced uncanny moments of revelation and very strange but beautiful coincidences
        27:27
    as we started out i made a post on facebook and my friend louise brady from the kixa d clan and sitka she wrote your
        27:35
    ancestors are guiding you and certainly that seemed to be the case
        27:40
    because there were too many coincidences for that not to be true and so tonight's presentation arrives in
        27:47
    two parts in the first part we'll describe our i'll describe our journey on the trail of tears
        27:53
    by appeal to these twin concerns of auto ethnography genealogy and cultural political history
        28:00
    and in the second part i'll return to the question of story and social justice to talk about restorative and decolonial
        28:08
    legibility by appeal to two stories that have really had a profound impact on me
        28:13
    and one of them's a cherokee story and one of them uh is a jewish story
        28:21
    um so i think it's uh worth sort of starting out with with a little bit of
        28:27
    of my biography um as a kid i was raised with so much
        28:32
    confidence in my cherokee identity my grandfather raised us to be fiercely proud of being
        28:40
    cherokee he didn't know a lot of the language uh because he got kicked out of school
        28:46
    in the sixth grade um when his uh one of his brothers beat up
        28:52
    the teacher and uh this was in this was in outside in tahlequah oklahoma
        28:58
    um but one of his brothers was a fluent cherokee speaker
        29:03
    and his name is sequoia but everybody called him bull i knew him as uncle bull
        29:10
    and when i was 18 years old after i graduated high school i was going to go live with my uncle bull and learn the
        29:17
    language from him but then he had a stroke and he lost the ability to talk
        29:23
    and i remember talking to my grandpa about this and about
        29:29
    how sad it made me and how i didn't want the language to die with his generation because my dad
        29:35
    didn't speak it and all my grandpa knew was handshake language to aja chooch you
        29:41
    know things and naughty things he would say in uh in cherokee
        29:46
    and i was talking with him and he asked me at this point i was probably about 22
        29:52
    years old he just said well how does it feel to be the last of the damn mohegans
        29:58
    um
        30:04
    i didn't think i'd say that out loud and suddenly feel so much emotion
        30:12
    but um and you got to understand that my um my grandfather was born in oklahoma
        30:20
    he moved in 1950 they moved to central valley california
        30:26
    where my dad was born and my dad uh
        30:31
    excuse me it was in lodi california doing during the vietnam war and you know his story is that in san
        30:38
    francisco you had all these radical anti-war protests in lodi california there were actually pro-vietnam war
        30:44
    protests and as an 18-year-old at a high school who didn't know what he was going to do he joined the infantry he enlisted in
        30:50
    the infantry uh and he went to and he went to vietnam and when he came back i was born
        30:56
    in colorado and i lived my life as an army brat um and throughout all of this time you know
        31:03
    my dad was sort of running away from lodi and he felt that his family his father had
        31:09
    been running away from tahlequah oklahoma uh and through all of this time he kept
        31:15
    telling me or it's not through all this time but really like at the end of high school in my early 20s he kept telling
        31:20
    me you got to give it up you got to give it up give up give up your concern for the cherokee language give up your concern
        31:26
    for cherokee culture and that was a you know i was concerned
        31:31
    that the richness of our ancestral and genealogical strength would would silently vanish um
        31:38
    i'll say that to this day my dad regrets that he really regrets having ever said that
        31:43
    um but because of that is is you know uh my you know i had for various reasons i
        31:50
    had tried tried college right out of high school but i had to drop out when i was 24 i got back into college i
        31:56
    got my own student loans and stuff and um and at that point i was as i would say
        32:02
    seduced by white supremacy this was the moment when my dad was telling me go study go study plato go study socrates
        32:10
    these are the people you ought to be studying go to europe go travel europe um and so i was seduced by white
        32:17
    supremacy because you know you think about it i mean as cornell west says the university is historically a white
        32:23
    supremacist institution um but i never left my own private concern for my cherokee identity and in
        32:29
    fact when i went to grad school at purdue university i got to do the school of criticism and theory at cornell
        32:34
    university i studied with eric schaefetz we did native american literature and federal indian law
        32:40
    my dissertation like i said picked up native american lit um and that was powerful and that was
        32:46
    important to me i had studied i started uh purdue university in 2004
        32:51
    right and my grandfather died right before uh like literally a month before i started classes at purdue university my
        32:57
    grandfather died i went to california i held his hand in the hospital as he died
        33:04
    you know purdue university was like the only university i think he knew by name since you know he was a kid my dad used
        33:10
    to say oh yeah we grew up watching purdue football so when i walked into the hospital he had one of these breathing masks on and
        33:17
    do the math he said my grandson's going to purdue he was so proud of me
        33:23
    because i'm i'm a first generation college student out of my family and um
        33:29
    but you know i i thought this gave me some good credentials until i went to uas
        33:34
    after completing my dissertation and there on thing i met a dear friend and colleague of
        33:40
    mine ishmael hope and he gave me a really good admonishment i taught a class my first
        33:45
    summer there called trickster hermeneutics and uh ishmael i invited ishmael to come tell raven's stories and
        33:52
    he told me he said you know your air judician and native american lit is fine but unless you it's rooted
        34:00
    in close proximity with the source material the oral literary indigenous source material
        34:07
    then it doesn't mean that much and so uh i he ishmael actually took a
        34:12
    couple of my classes and i would drive him home on tuesdays and we just had some incredibly rich conversations on
        34:19
    oral literary tradition phenomenology and these kinds of things um
        34:24
    and so uh you know it's it's with all this in mind and all of this backstory which is not
        34:30
    an uncommon story there's so many cherokee scholars and colleagues i have out there who have parallel stories to
        34:36
    mine and you think about this one generation my dad telling me to give it up so many
        34:42
    indigenous families deal with that one generation says give it up one generation wants to sever it um and the
        34:48
    joke was you know my dad's a baby boomer and i used to tell my dad you know i hate that fleetwood mac song man you can
        34:54
    go your own way it's like you know like i get you can go
        34:59
    your own way but i want to be rooted in our ancestral genealogy that's what i
        35:05
    wanted to carry us through um and so that's that's some backstory here
        35:13
    um and then so this is a map i actually made for my daughter but i thought i
        35:18
    would reuse it here we ended up going to um uh we presented in our classroom our our
        35:25
    trip and so we just have this line that shows i just do know to to
        35:30
    where the trail of tears was you can take a closer look at this map here um
        35:36
    and uh you know you can i don't know how well people can see this
        35:41
    but you see all these different trail trails of tears and there are many different routes
        35:48
    and we started here near dahlonega georgia dahlonega is
        35:54
    where my ancestors cherokee ancestors lived before their land was stolen from them
        35:59
    um in 1832 during the first gold rush in the united states
        36:05
    the word dahlonega is a cherokee word it's the word that means gold it also means yellow um and and uh the official
        36:14
    trail of tears went from 1838 to 1839 but just to give some some backstory
        36:20
    here um i'm not sure if i okay uh but to give some backstory here um
        36:26
    the uh in in 1828 the state of georgia made it illegal
        36:33
    for um cherokees to congregate within the state of georgia except for one reason
        36:40
    cherokees were allowed to congregate in order to cede land to the state of georgia but other than that
        36:46
    the cherokees were not allowed to meet at all in 1830 andrew jackson signed the indian removal
        36:53
    act and ate and promised the state of georgia that he would get rid of all the cherokees in
        37:00
    1832 right before 1832 gold was discovered the first gold rush in the united states
        37:06
    and uh my ancestors lost their land in the six lottery
        37:12
    um that that stole the land and then gave it out to prospectors uh by lottery
        37:19
    and so technically uh my direct ancestors are called old settlers
        37:24
    because they arrived to indian country what is today oklahoma before the
        37:30
    official triloties of 1838-1839 however david kornsilk
        37:35
    uh writes this this uh he writes for many the trail of tears includes all migrations west
        37:42
    uh and in this case he's talking about a woman named elizabeth terrell and he says elizabeth terrell was an old
        37:48
    settler who came west before the event we officially know is the trail of tears that does not lessen her anguish at
        37:55
    leaving her ancestors and beloved homeland behind and certainly makes her journey a personal trail of tears
        38:02
    and uh i i love that quotation because um i can trace my cherokee
        38:08
    ancestors back to nine generations or through nine generations
        38:14
    um and i'll just share some of this genealogy real quick um you know if you if you look at this
        38:19
    slide here on the right you have uh there's there's my daughter mila there's my father
        38:26
    george and there's me and this is a photograph of the three of us we took at the end of the trail
        38:32
    then there's my grandfather lucian neely and my grandmother his mother was bitty ally
        38:41
    um and she was the daughter of andrew jack robertson who everybody called uncle
        38:48
    jack uh everybody called uncle jack and then his mother was nancy terrell
        38:54
    now andrew his name was andrew jackson robertson nobody in my family knows why he was named andrew jackson robertson but the
        39:00
    name sticks in part because um robertson is sorry jackson is a middle name
        39:06
    that i have it's my father's middle name um but that's it's still a big mystery how
        39:12
    he got that name but he was the first generation born in oklahoma or indian country uh after the trail of tears and
        39:19
    then his mother nancy terrell her mother elizabeth terrell quawetza
        39:25
    and her mother leitote those are my great great grandmothers who were all born in um
        39:32
    georgia and uh had their land stolen from them they migrated in 1832 but a great great
        39:41
    great uncle of mine and a great great great aunt of mine they stayed behind in
        39:47
    georgia and they eventually were forced on the official uh trail of tears
        39:54
    and and you know so if we look at this real quick uh there's some interesting stories i've learned in my genealogy
        40:02
    first of all my five-time great-grandmother leitoti as you can see she was born about 1765
        40:09
    in cherokee nation east and she died 1832 in cherokee nation uh indian territory what's today
        40:14
    oklahoma um and you see the date she died 1832 that's that's the year they arrived
        40:22
    near tahlequah and so she barely survived the forced
        40:27
    removal um and i and i found some interesting research in 1889 the federal government
        40:35
    published uh through the uh bureau of american ethnography a manuscript that shows that my five
        40:42
    times great grandmother was the first cherokee to convert to christianity which is which is pretty wild
        40:48
    and then my four times great grandmother what was her cherokee name but she came to be known as elizabeth trail and
        40:54
    that's the person that david cornslip was just was talking about now this is this is phenomenal to me
        41:01
    this just happened um in uh last month actually um
        41:06
    i woke up and my eyes are blurry and i'm sort of trying to wake up and i read that
        41:13
    passage from david cornsilk about on one of these private facebook groups the cherokee nation has
        41:19
    and um and i read this for many of the trailer tears includes all migrations west elizabeth terrell was an old
        41:25
    southerner who came west before and i'm reading that and i see her picture i'm like wait a minute that's my that's my
        41:31
    four times great grandmother what and i had this picture hanging on my office at uas so i saw it every single
        41:37
    day i was on campus and lo and behold it turns out that there's a a magazine out
        41:44
    of oklahoma called the bartlesville monthly and my four times great grandmother was
        41:50
    tada on the cover looking like a cherokee supermodel
        41:58
    a cherokee cover girl right so that just completely blew my mind and
        42:04
    i right away i contacted the publishers of the magazine and i said that's my great great great great grandmother
        42:10
    and uh so they uh they they told me that david cornstein gave him the
        42:17
    gave them the uh uh the the image um and so yeah all of that's fascinating
        42:24
    uh genealogy and then my great great grandfather uh andrew jackson robertson
        42:30
    he was the first born after the trail of tears and i got this lovely obituary a
        42:35
    facsimile of an obituary that talks about his accomplishments he was he really helped rebuild the
        42:41
    cherokee nation he helped make the bricks that were used to develop the cherokee national courthouse which is
        42:47
    now uh it's it's one of the architectural gems of tahlequah oklahoma um and then i got i got his actual
        42:55
    portrait painted by a famous cherokee artist named george cochrane hanging behind me uh as well so i feel like that that
        43:02
    they're always with me um yeah there's some there's a historical
        43:08
    timeline i already sort of mentioned um but i'll get into some of of um
        43:16
    the journey here the the trail um we started our journey uh
        43:23
    like i said in dahlonega um which was the uh we were first they went from
        43:28
    dahlonega to to new ichota and new echota
        43:34
    so dahlonega was the area where my ancestors were but then nuachota served as the cherokee
        43:42
    capital from 1825 to 1835. and it's a beautiful place uh it was a
        43:48
    vibrant little town as you probably know uh the you know cherokees you know we we
        43:54
    really work to assimilate um as a modality of survival uh with the
        44:00
    onslaught of of subtler colonialism and because of that uh nuachota adopted a
        44:06
    lot of these features it had a two-story council house it had the supreme court there it had a print shop and it was
        44:13
    home of the cherokee phoenix starting in 1828 so sequoia the genius he was
        44:20
    invented the cherokee syllabary and revealed it in 1821 through the help of
        44:26
    his young daughter which my daughter there she is in the image um loves the story of how sequoia's
        44:32
    daughter was one of the key people who helped spread the use of the syllabary but in 1828 um
        44:39
    the cherokee phoenix was started in new ochoda georgia and it was the first bilingual
        44:44
    it's the first indigenous newspaper in the united states and it was bilingual and it was uh
        44:51
    it was it was edited by uh elias boudinot and samuel worster
        44:56
    and um uh there's there's a lot to say there about elias uh buddha not but i'll refrain for
        45:04
    a moment um but as we were walking through new echota georgia and in the streets of the
        45:09
    capital we were the only one there and it was just an amazing experience to be the only one there many people say that the trail of tears
        45:16
    started in new echota because elias boudinot and major ridge and john ridge
        45:23
    uh these were three uh folks who signed what became called
        45:28
    what what was known as the treaty of nuachota and that was a very small group of people
        45:36
    called the treaty party they came to be known as the treaty party and basically they were cherokee leaders but um
        45:43
    they ended up signing this treaty that made they gave the legal foundation
        45:48
    for the trail of tears to happen so uh elias boudinot
        45:53
    major ridge john ridge they signed the treaty of new echota saying that the cherokee would relocate to indian
        45:59
    territory um they had two years to to to make this move
        46:04
    and um so some folks think it atlanta there's huge it basically created a cherokee
        46:10
    civil war um which you know i mean it still has its effects today in the cherokee nation
        46:17
    um but it traded that treaty traded land for land west of the mississippi it got provisions for making the move it was it
        46:24
    promised sovereignty in the new territory and for those of you who may know you know in the last couple years the cherokee nation has got um
        46:32
    representation in the house of representatives and that was made possible that was actually promise in
        46:37
    the treaty of new york um but from dahlonega in new orleans um
        46:45
    we went to uh uh chief john ross house
        46:51
    um so if if the uh treaty party headed up sort of by lightest buddha not
        46:57
    major ridge and john ridge they were one small faction of the cherokee nation at the time uh john ross who was principal
        47:04
    chief was the other major faction uh most 90 something percent of cherokee
        47:09
    people uh resisted the treaty treaty of new echota but it was ratified in the us
        47:14
    congress by a single vote uh but we stopped off here at his house uh the chief john ross house it was the
        47:21
    um it was a really wonderful moment because we showed up to the house and it was locked down nobody was there but there
        47:27
    was a phone number i found online and i called the phone number and right away within five minutes the caret uh care
        47:34
    keeper came down and he opened everything up for us and we spent the whole afternoon at chief john ross's
        47:39
    house and uh and just getting this in immense oral history from the uh
        47:46
    the person who who keeps the grounds there um and uh
        47:51
    my my daughter who loves archery one of the things she got into one of the things that she was really excited about was she actually
        47:57
    got to hold chief john ross's longbow um and that was that was a pretty cool
        48:03
    thing and then of course while we were here as well uh the care keeper
        48:09
    told a lot of story about the civil war in that area and the history of cherokees with the civil war and my dad
        48:15
    is oh there's the longbow right there that's the longbow that
        48:20
    and um that my dad is a retired army officer found the discussions on um
        48:28
    [Music] the civil war in the cherokee relationship to the civil war which was
        48:33
    fraught with with with the man that's a whole lot of history there
        48:38
    yeah so that was intense i'm gonna keep going here um
        48:43
    and then one of the coolest places we stopped off after that was red clay state park and uh all of us really agree
        48:50
    that this was one of the most special moments of the trip this was the the place where
        48:56
    the cherokee nation held its last tribal council before removal and it was just over the border of
        49:03
    georgia into tennessee because you remember i told you in 1828 the state of georgia made it illegal for anyone to
        49:08
    congregate and so they did it just over the border and what was so special about this place
        49:16
    if you see the um video there
        49:21
    the reason um that cherokee people picked this place as the
        49:28
    site of its last tribal council was in part because its proximity to this sacred spring called the blue hole
        49:35
    and um we showed up and we told the national park ranger there
        49:42
    who we were and what we were doing and she was extraordinarily kind and
        49:48
    um of course i knew the sacred spring was here but right away she offered to open it up to us and it was incredible we got to sort of
        49:55
    i called it our cherokee baptism we got to get in and and uh sort of wash
        50:00
    ourselves and and clean ourselves and um and and aaron was the the
        50:06
    ranger's name she told us that she uh never opens that place up except
        50:12
    for cherokee people and that uh she'd been there for like 14 years
        50:17
    and only twice has she ever arrested anybody and both times was because they tried to get over that fence there and
        50:23
    get into the springs themselves so we really appreciated um
        50:29
    that opportunity it was a really kind of a holy experience and then um also here at red clay state park is the
        50:36
    eternal flame because all three you know if you don't know there's three federally recognized
        50:42
    cherokee nations there's the ebci or the eastern band of cherokee indians there's the um cherokee nation
        50:50
    which i'm a citizen of and then there's the ukb the united gedua band which is also headquartered out of tahlequah
        50:56
    oklahoma but they met together in 1984 for the first time since the trail of
        51:02
    tears and they started there the eternal flame which burns uh still
        51:08
    um and uh so that's that that was a really really special place
        51:14
    after uh red clay state park we went to probably one of the the most sacred
        51:20
    destinations on our spot and that was waffle house
        51:26
    [Laughter] you gotta understand if you're in the south there are waffle houses everywhere
        51:33
    and my daughter was born and raised in alaska and she'd never in her life seen a waffle house and so my dad and i we're
        51:38
    going to take you to waffle house at the end of that day we went to waffle
        51:44
    house little joke
        51:49
    yeah but then we kept going uh and we visited fort cass in the hawasi river in
        51:54
    nancy ward's grave and uh all of this is in tennessee and this was a really
        52:00
    difficult day for us for a couple of reasons one because fort cass became the ground
        52:06
    zero for uh the concentration camps that were used to
        52:14
    imprison the cherokees before removal fort cass measured it doesn't exist anymore but it measured six miles wide
        52:21
    and 10 miles long and it housed thousands of cherokees and um
        52:27
    i heard estimates of some close to 2 000 cherokee people died in fort cass um
        52:33
    uh concentration camp before the removal even started
        52:38
    um and uh and and there's nothing around here there's no in this whole area
        52:44
    there's there's no memorials um there's no signs there's no interpretive signs
        52:49
    um you know you get these little trail of tears original route signs but there's no there's no place to go
        52:56
    and in fact one of the big places is called rattlesnake springs well actually in this picture right here you see the
        53:01
    hawasi river heritage center i'm about to come i'm about to come to that my story here um but otherwise we um
        53:09
    we uh we drove around like rattlesnake springs was one of these places uh that
        53:14
    was so important to cherokee history in terms of the removal and you couldn't get to it because it was all farmland it
        53:20
    was all private farmland beautiful of course rolling hills with farmhouses and
        53:25
    farmland but it's all off limits to us all private property no trespassing um
        53:31
    and and and churches farmland and churches that's all it was and uh but we did find this uh hawaii um
        53:40
    river heritage center and we went in there and that was the other difficult moment for us because the woman who ran
        53:46
    it uh claimed cherokee ancestry um but i'm
        53:51
    sure that's debatable um certainly none of the three federally recognized nations would
        53:57
    claim her as cherokee um but she she just made this awful um
        54:03
    claim that the trail of tears was not as bad as everybody makes it out to be she said in fact it's not as bad as the media
        54:10
    would like to tell you and then of course you know when you hear people talk about the media um that sense sets
        54:16
    off you know triggers about political ideology and political leaning and these kinds of things
        54:21
    but it was an awful thing to say and she said that uh there were some cherokees in fact when they passed through like
        54:27
    missouri it reminded them so much of their ancestral lands that they just broke off and settled there that's all
        54:33
    lies that's all lies and in fact they put their convenient lives for so-called wannabes
        54:38
    who can say yeah my ancestors i'm cherokee my ancestors they broke away from the trail of tears and these kinds
        54:44
    of things that stuff didn't happen um it didn't happen like like
        54:49
    they say the cherokee people are the most documented people in world history we have so many roles so many rosters
        54:56
    to say that somehow my cherokee ancestors escaped you know any of the roles or registers
        55:03
    that that's a tremendously unlikely possibility um and then and then that day we had
        55:09
    nancy ward's grave you can see the sciences high priestess of the cherokees and always loyal friend of white settlers is buried on the ridge to the
        55:16
    west she repeatedly prevented massacres of white settlers and several times rescued captives from death at the hands of her
        55:22
    people she is also credited with the introduction of milk cows and many improvements in homemaking into the
        55:27
    cherokee economy well this is a memorial put up at her grave site by the daughters of the american uh revolution
        55:35
    um and it's it's highly problematic uh and in the in one of the reasons
        55:41
    why you get this notion of the cherokee princess if you've if you've heard that you know there was no such thing as
        55:47
    cherokee princesses but when the settler colonists came over uh what they found was that uh
        55:54
    cherokee people our cherokee culture had a profound respect for women i mean
        55:59
    women could serve as nancy ward was one of these was a beloved woman um they they had
        56:06
    their own counsel and a beloved woman like nancy ward and there's her grave right there could overturn any decision
        56:13
    made by um you know every every cherokee village had a peace chief and a war chief and if the peace chiefs uh decided
        56:19
    to go to war the beloved woman could overturn that decision um and of course cherokee culture is a
        56:25
    matrilineal culture so all of our clan identification came through uh the
        56:30
    maternal line property was held by uh the women the farmland the agriculture all that was was held by women um and
        56:37
    women would show up uh throughout the 18th century to be part of treaty
        56:42
    negotiations with the government and so uh for the the the colonists they thought that they they called us a
        56:49
    petticoat government and they said that um that uh
        56:54
    the cherokee women were treated like royalty right of course because of the misogynistic
        57:00
    patriarchal culture of the settler colonists but so that's that that was a that was
        57:06
    all part of the very difficult day for us because we just dealt with with misinformation revisionist history
        57:13
    and things like that but then our next destination was cherokee north carolina we actually veered off a little bit so at this point
        57:20
    we broke away from the trail of tears to go to cherokee north carolina um i mentioned i was an army brat what's
        57:27
    interesting about that is uh from the ages of three until 18 uh i graduated
        57:32
    high school the same month my dad retired from the army uh i spent my whole entire childhood in
        57:38
    southeast united states my friends who were military brats were going to germany they were going to south korea
        57:43
    they were going all over the place but for some reason my entire childhood was spent in the
        57:49
    southeast united states so i grew up going to the smoky mountains camping there boating in there
        57:55
    um and uh you know it was it's kind of a neat coincidence my dad thought that was really cool when we were talking about
        58:01
    um you know uh the way that um we spent our entire life within or
        58:07
    within 200 miles of traditional ancestral uh cherokee land um
        58:12
    and then from we spent some good time in cherokee and then we got back onto the trail of tears and we
        58:18
    ended up um at blyth ferry now blythe ferry it was the first
        58:25
    memorial right here you can see it it's the first memorial that gave seed to the national park service recreating um the
        58:33
    national park trail the trail of tears um it's a it's it's probably the best most comprehensive
        58:39
    memorial that we encountered uh here uh during forced migration
        58:45
    the forced removal happened the first big obstacle for the over the land removal was the tennessee river and so
        58:51
    uh the cherokees were forced here in in um i think it's like 12 different regiments
        58:57
    they were broken up into like 12 different regiments passed through here so two-thirds of all cherokees who were
        59:03
    on the trail of tears passed through blyth ferry many of them died here because the river was low and the winter
        59:08
    was brutal and it iced over and um
        59:14
    but and what i like about uh the blyth fairy memorial
        59:20
    is that it's the first memorial that specifically invoked the language and the vocabulary of ethnic cleansing
        59:27
    um so i'm sort of moving through this fast but i just wanted to get a picture of this dedication here of the memorial it
        59:34
    says this memorial is dedicated to the cherokees that died and those that cried due to their force removal which has
        59:41
    become known as the trail of tears today we are champions of human rights and
        59:46
    oppose ethnic cleansing what happened to native peoples of north america should not be forgotten
        59:52
    um and i think that's powerful because all these other memorials of course use the vocabulary of genocide but this was
        59:58
    the first one that specifically used ethnic cleansing and it was a real sobering moment for us
        1:00:05
    uh and then we headed on uh down and um i thought i would share this this uh
        1:00:11
    brief video real quick because up until this point we had been traveling the original route of the trail of tears
        1:00:18
    and then we ended up at falls creek falls state park and i knew that there was something related to the trail of tears there but
        1:00:25
    i wasn't quite sure exactly what it was and when we showed up to falls creek falls state park we asked a bunch of
        1:00:30
    people nobody knew anything but uh some of the employees there went and got two park rangers for us and the two park
        1:00:36
    rangers showed up and they we told them our story what we were doing and they told us about this land that um
        1:00:43
    that the the park had just purchased and this was part of the original trail of tears um and i'll just let me see if i
        1:00:50
    can play this real quick for you all right so this is a really
        1:00:55
    interesting part of our trip because so far can you hear it we uh began in dahlonega georgia
        1:01:02
    where our ancestors were and then we went over uh to red clay state park
        1:01:08
    um and then we uh headed over to cherokee north carolina coming out of cherokee north carolina
        1:01:14
    uh our first stop was falls creek falls state park we're following the route that the remember the removal bike
        1:01:20
    riders uh take when we got to uh the falls creek falls
        1:01:26
    park we talked to a couple park rangers because there's not a lot of literature on the trail of tears in this area it's
        1:01:31
    not in barbara duncan's book and no nobody other than the rangers at the
        1:01:37
    park knew what we were talking about the rangers told us they just acquired this land and they gave us directions
        1:01:44
    to get here and the whole trip we've been following sections of the original trail of tears
        1:01:51
    but that's been on paved road so we encounter these signs and say original route and we're driving on it
        1:01:57
    at 45 50 miles per hour can i say but here we are
        1:02:03
    here we are um mila you want to tell us where we're at yeah i'm over here
        1:02:17
    we're at the original route and it's not paved down
        1:02:24
    and over there there are wagon lots from where the rad wagon drove on the
        1:02:31
    trail years so you can see that's right here thank
        1:02:36
    you you can see here's a rut it's all the way down here
        1:02:42
    so here's a wagon train and then the ranger said that uh
        1:02:49
    because it got so muddy they had to shift over here's another lane
        1:02:59
    coming right down here all over grown up right here you can see it
        1:03:05
    and there's a third one over here
        1:03:16
    i think i see a fourth one over there
        1:03:22
    right one two three
        1:03:37
    four lanes of the absolute original northern route of the trail of tears like that's where we're at right now
        1:03:44
    and we ought to do some detective work to get it
        1:03:51
    i wonder if they remember the removal riders come through here the ranger said he was going to that the
        1:03:58
    park um was going to do something with this but they don't know what to do yet
        1:04:06
    there's farmland over there i wonder how far down
        1:04:21
    so uh that was a really intense moment and then later on as we got through missouri we encountered other areas of
        1:04:28
    the trail of tears the original trail of tears that have been preserved much better like nobody
        1:04:33
    as the ranger said there's nothing here um but then we actually watched parts of
        1:04:39
    the original trail of tears all through missouri um and uh
        1:04:45
    and on into tahlequah oklahoma oops sorry here we go um
        1:04:52
    yeah and then uh what happened was we um ended up in tahlequah oklahoma uh and
        1:04:58
    these are images taken from inside of what is now the cherokee nation
        1:05:03
    historical museum uh in the building that my great great grandfather made the bricks for
        1:05:10
    um and we spent some time in tahlequah visiting family and
        1:05:15
    uh going to lots of graves where that my our ancestors are buried
        1:05:21
    and something phenomenal happened this is why it feels like our ancestors guided us we went to go look for the
        1:05:27
    grave of my four times great-grandmother quadrucha we had the gravesite and it was in stillwell oklahoma and so we
        1:05:35
    started down the road uh there and that's 10 killer lake we camped at 10 kilo lake i used to play at 10 killer
        1:05:41
    lake as a kid and um on the way there we see this sign that
        1:05:47
    says the end of the trail all right what put the brakes on turn around go follow
        1:05:52
    that sign and we ended up at uh one of the disbandment camps
        1:05:59
    and it was such a phenomenal moment because we didn't know about that disbandment camp we went looking for my
        1:06:04
    four times great grandmother's grave and uh on the way there we found it
        1:06:10
    and so we literally literally it brought us to the very end of the trail
        1:06:16
    and uh yeah that's the sign end of the trail that's the sign that we saw
        1:06:21
    and so we ended up coming around from the very beginning
        1:06:27
    to where our ancestors lived and had their land stolen from them to the very end of the trail of tears it was a
        1:06:33
    really phenomenal experience um that's the cemetery there
        1:06:43
    so i i want to end with another story here and
        1:06:48
    actually two quick stories and i i'm mindful of time here i apologize if i'm going on too long
        1:06:53
    um but there's two stories i want to i want to share these and so the first one is a
        1:06:59
    cherokee story uh and it's told by freeman al and uh i'm i'm just going to read it
        1:07:05
    briefly out of this book edited by barbara duncan the origin of the milky way barbara duncan has been such a good
        1:07:11
    friend uh and and and um she's so so knowledgeable
        1:07:17
    um but this story uh she tells me takes place at clingman's dome uh kuwahi which
        1:07:23
    is the cherokee word for this area today it's called clingman's dome it's the highest point on the appalachian trail
        1:07:29
    um and so i actually i tried to find the video i my dad and my daughter and i we
        1:07:35
    broke off the the main path there and i read this story out loud but i can't find that video so i'm going to read it uh real
        1:07:41
    quick to you all it's called people singing in the earth long before the tragedies of the people
        1:07:48
    happened the cherokees were sitting in a council house you can imagine this big building sitting on top of a mound with
        1:07:55
    thousands of seats inside and they're all gathered in the middle of winter and there's a big fire
        1:08:01
    crackling in the middle of the council and the chiefs are all gathered in the center at the bottom and the people are
        1:08:07
    listening listening to the oral history being told or to the business being discussed
        1:08:13
    when all of a sudden with no wind whatsoever outside the bare skin on the
        1:08:18
    council house opens up wide enough for a person to come through and then it sort of folds back
        1:08:25
    and then all of a sudden drops back into place the cherokee being very spiritual as
        1:08:31
    they were in those days realized that someone some spirit had entered the council house
        1:08:37
    so they sat very quietly and sure enough up in the corner of the council house they began to see a light
        1:08:44
    a sort of greenish-colored light materialized and it soon turned into a person
        1:08:50
    they knew this person was a cherokee but they didn't know who he was he came down to where the chiefs were
        1:08:56
    sitting and he said you my brothers and sisters must follow me for out of the east will come a group of
        1:09:03
    people who will destroy your homes and your villages will be burned and your children will be killed and your
        1:09:09
    homeland will be taken away and never again will you be happy and so the cherokee said no we can't
        1:09:16
    leave because this land belonged to our mothers mothers mothers
        1:09:22
    he said i'll be back in seven days and you must fast and decide whether you'll go with
        1:09:27
    me or stay here and suffer in seven days he came back again
        1:09:32
    and half of the people had decided to follow him half had decided to stay home
        1:09:38
    and so when he came the half that followed him went up toward the mountain the sacred mountain of the cherokee
        1:09:44
    which is today called clingman's dome and he got to this great massive
        1:09:50
    rock cliff and he touched it with his hand and the whole cliff opened up and you could hear people singing and
        1:09:56
    laughing inside the mountain and the stairwell leading up to a beautiful land of springtime and summer
        1:10:04
    and the people began to march in with the butterflies flying and the fruit trees bearing fruit and the people were
        1:10:10
    all happy one man at the end decided that he had left his family there in the
        1:10:15
    village and he wanted to go back and get them and bring them to this beautiful land
        1:10:20
    so he rushed back to the village and headed back to the mountain when he got back to the mountain with his family the mountain had closed up
        1:10:28
    and they said he was crazy and they left him there alone he stayed there for seven days and on
        1:10:34
    the seventh day he began to hear the singing deep within the earth and so he went back to the village
        1:10:41
    and from that day forward he told the people in the village that if you're quiet enough long enough and if you sit and listen to
        1:10:49
    the streams and really are aware and very quiet and still
        1:10:54
    that you too can hear the people singing within the earth those happy ones that went on before
        1:11:01
    and sure enough the settlers came and they began to burn the villages and take away the land and the cherokee people
        1:11:07
    have been searching for that happiness they had long long ago and i think the teaching of this
        1:11:13
    story not only was the fact there was a revelation of what was about to happen
        1:11:19
    people losing their homeland on the trail of tears and so on but also to teach us that we should
        1:11:25
    never let the child disappear from us you remember when you were a child when
        1:11:31
    you would take off your shoes and prawn through the mud puddles and laugh and sing remember when you were a child that not
        1:11:37
    a butterfly passed that you didn't see it and chase it and not an animal or an insect were
        1:11:43
    overlooked and that you were so close to nature and so close to mother earth that those were the things that were
        1:11:49
    important to you we should remain like children and sometimes take our shoes off and prod
        1:11:55
    through the mud puddles and sit by the streams and listen to the talking of the streams and the whispers of the wind
        1:12:00
    we must preserve the earth and we must value the lives of our elders in the lives of our children and save them a
        1:12:06
    place to live if we don't then there will be a revelation for the people of today as
        1:12:12
    well as for all of the cherokee i love that story for a couple of reasons one because my daughter was on
        1:12:19
    the trail of tears with us and she loved the butterflies i actually have a video of her at clingman's dome here and i
        1:12:24
    asked her what is different about this place than king garani in alaska where we were living she says there's more butterflies here and when we were at the
        1:12:32
    sacred springs the blue hole at red clay state park we got out of the sacred spring and a
        1:12:37
    butterfly landed on my daughter's hand and she just loved that so much so the
        1:12:42
    coincidence of these stories is amazing but also because um last
        1:12:48
    summer uh two summers ago the summer of 2019 i was teaching at uh at the outer
        1:12:54
    coast summer seminar in sitka alaska and um this is when our our governor
        1:13:00
    started just a wage war on our economy and our university and i felt myself
        1:13:06
    full so full of anger um because i worked so hard to to get to where i was at that point and this governor was just
        1:13:12
    gonna come through and destroy everything and um and he was a friend of donald trump who
        1:13:18
    has the portrait of andrew jackson in his portrait and i didn't want that anger to become hatred i really did not
        1:13:24
    want that anger to become hatred in me but i felt it becoming hatred and so i went down to the costa heen the what is
        1:13:30
    called uh the indian river in sitka and i sat there and i meditated and i
        1:13:36
    meditated and i thought about this story and i just listened and
        1:13:42
    it is as if you can hear the people singing in the earth as if i could hear my grandfather calling to me you know
        1:13:48
    helping me get helping me heal through that hatred uh that was beginning to to to form
        1:13:56
    in me and it's not a hearing that you hear with your ears it's a hearing with your body this is why i love
        1:14:02
    phenomenology so much because you hear this with your body and you know since rene descartes
        1:14:10
    you know settler colonial society doesn't have that relationship with the body anymore
        1:14:16
    um and uh so that's that there's a couple reasons why i love that um and then
        1:14:22
    there's there's one more story i want to conclude with and it's it's the jewish story i was talking about but i'm gonna
        1:14:27
    i'm gonna just tell it briefly since we're running out of time but it comes from emmanuel levanos who
        1:14:33
    publishes it in one of his books uh called nine talmudic readings and he titles it the temptation of temptations
        1:14:40
    and in it you hear the story of the jewish people who are wandering through the desert and they come to the promised land and there's this moment when god
        1:14:47
    grabs a mountain and he picks it up and turns it over their heads like a tub is
        1:14:52
    what it reads and god says you know accept the covenant or here you will die
        1:14:59
    and uh and you know it's fascinating because it's it's not like an angry god
        1:15:05
    or anything it's it's very much this idea as i've come to understand it through my jewish teachers it's very much this idea that you know this is the
        1:15:12
    way to live you you you accept the covenant this is the way you will live and this is the way that you will
        1:15:17
    survive uh it's protocol and it's ceremony and um
        1:15:23
    and uh the jews it is said in this in this piece they committed to doing it they
        1:15:30
    committed to it before they even heard the terms of the covenant they committed to a doing before a hearing and us makes
        1:15:37
    a lot out of this because he says in the socratic tradition of western philosophical tradition we don't do
        1:15:43
    uh before hearing we insist on hearing first the terms of that covenant and
        1:15:49
    then decide whether or not we want to do it and this is so common when you talk about decolonizing the university or
        1:15:56
    decolonizing our institutions even at uas where i was with the 20 alaska native student body non-indigenous
        1:16:03
    faculty constantly want to say well do you colonize the colonies tell us what that means tell us what that means and
        1:16:09
    my response was to tell this story and to say what lebanon's find so beautiful about this story
        1:16:15
    is not only did the jews in that moment commit to a doing before hearing but
        1:16:20
    they understood that one must do in order to hear and in the same ways you have to commit
        1:16:26
    to a doing before you can hear what decolonizing entails that's how it
        1:16:32
    becomes legible and you know i think about joy harjo who says
        1:16:37
    i do not know your language but i hear the sounds of vowels breaking through the waves
        1:16:43
    and uh when i first started my clingit language courses uh the first thing you learn are are the vowels
        1:16:50
    and uh in klinkic and very similar in cherokee uh when you you don't ask somebody
        1:16:55
    well in english we would say do you speak clink it but in clanket the word means do you hear clink it the
        1:17:02
    question is do you hear clink it and it's a repetitive verb so it's do you repeatedly hear clink it
        1:17:07
    and so i think i think that's that's the powerful aspect of what i call an ontology of story
        1:17:14
    which is indexed to what levanos calls a consciousness of hearing these are just fundamentally different starting points
        1:17:20
    than we've inherited from subtler colonial uh philosophical traditions
        1:17:25
    so i'll i'll end it there and i apologize if i went too late but we have at least 10 minutes for questions and i'm happy to hang out
        1:17:31
    uh and talk more so all i love you man
        1:17:37
    i'm just like i moved in so many ways and my heart is so warm and um
        1:17:44
    i don't know the celebration of love that is telling our stories um
        1:17:50
    i guess we should just invite everybody to our post um session
        1:17:55
    uh happy hour lyceum or whatever that we would have so that um
        1:18:01
    those who have questions that don't get answered by half past the hour um could have the
        1:18:07
    opportunity to do so um so in in that
        1:18:13
    good faith um
        1:18:18
    the people who um have questions you know um i don't feel like i necessarily want to
        1:18:23
    read somebody's message from the chat so um i think we can set it so that you can
        1:18:30
    just unmute yourself and you can ask a question so while everybody else is getting set up
        1:18:36
    um let me just ask you um in what ways do you feel like you were
        1:18:42
    able to actually decolonize the trail if not for everyone
        1:18:48
    for yourself um well so
        1:18:55
    you know i'm gonna write in 1500 words about this for uh the peace chronicle
        1:19:00
    right and um wim invited me to do it but all this crazy stuff was happening in
        1:19:05
    alaska and he said well why don't you save it actually for an upcoming issue on healing
        1:19:11
    and so i really think that the healing is what mattered the most the healing has been so incredible
        1:19:17
    across generations because you know my dad went from give it up in
        1:19:23
    my early 20s to indifference in my 30s as i was finishing up grad school
        1:19:32
    to at this point understanding that
        1:19:37
    our story is precisely what makes us cherokee i mean you know my my good friend
        1:19:43
    ernestine hayes clinkett writer she was the writer laureate for the state of alaska from 2016 to 2018 um i i
        1:19:50
    recommend two of her books uh blonde indian and the dao of raven um but she used to say the same thing to me she's
        1:19:57
    like i used to feel like i wasn't clinking enough or i wasn't indigenous indigenous enough
        1:20:03
    because of what happened to our family because of this generation in which everything sort of uh gets disconnected
        1:20:10
    but then she said but then i realized that's exactly what makes me indigenous in the united states and i think my dad
        1:20:16
    was able to to come to terms with that and now he is so proud and uh his cousin
        1:20:23
    my cousin ellen who i love his favorite cousin she's in her 70s and she's taking cherokee language classes with me now
        1:20:30
    my daughter's taking cherokee language classes with me um and
        1:20:35
    we've just really restored uh the family in this work and the family is so
        1:20:41
    grateful for this this work that that um that i kind of inaugurated right
        1:20:47
    i mean the great thing you know cherokee people we're we're fire keepers that's the thing we're fire keepers
        1:20:52
    um one of our early terms for ourselves was was keepers of the fire um and the fire
        1:20:58
    was so important you know we we we got to visit i didn't get put it on the slide there but we got to visit um the
        1:21:04
    gdua mound which is the mother town for all cherokee people all cherokee
        1:21:10
    people this is right outside cherokee north carolina and it's now owned again by the eastern band of cherokee indians but for
        1:21:16
    a long time it was farmland and the mount the sacred mound was bulldozed and raised and all of this stuff but um
        1:21:23
    but but we got to go there and it was that this gdua mound
        1:21:28
    held our fire our sacred fire so that all the surrounding villages once a year
        1:21:33
    they would extinguish their council house fires and they would come to gedua to reignite their fire
        1:21:39
    and i've been told that they've done some sort of geological testing on the gdua mound and the fire that we kept
        1:21:47
    there burned for so long and it burned for so hot it magnetized the earth
        1:21:52
    it's left its indelible imprint um on the land and so i just really love this
        1:21:57
    metaphor about keeping a fire uh and i that's what we're doing you know so my my i tell my i tell my
        1:22:04
    daughter all the time i said i tell her about that the talk i had with my grandpa and he said how does it feel to be the last of the damohans
        1:22:11
    and uh and when she speaks cherokee
        1:22:16
    to me um it's just it's the most beautiful thing
        1:22:21
    and uh we're keeping the fire so i i think that's
        1:22:26
    that's probably the biggest thing in response to your question wim uh has
        1:22:31
    very little to do with academia more to do with genealogy
        1:22:41
    i can go if that's okay that's right yeah um so that was very interesting
        1:22:47
    thank you so much for sharing your story with us uh really touching as well to listen to you especially to see it also
        1:22:54
    from your daughter's eyes you know it really makes a big difference to see um the younger ones you know kind
        1:23:00
    of like looking back in that sense um my question is i do a lot of work on decolonization so i'm really fascinated
        1:23:07
    whenever every time you you get there or you make a reference to it and i was reading something else that
        1:23:14
    you had written spoken about and you talked about decolonial justice and i was
        1:23:20
    wondering if it was possible in the context of this story that you were telling us for you to define it for
        1:23:26
    yourself like what do you mean by decolonial justice and also you know is that something that we can use in a way
        1:23:35
    to talk about what the blm movement is today because i'm i'm trying to make
        1:23:40
    those links for my students and i would love to hear your thoughts yeah i absolutely i think so um when i
        1:23:48
    when i think about decolonial justice there's there's such a genealogy of influence there
        1:23:55
    um and you know the folks who i'm really tied to in thinking about
        1:24:01
    this um sort of begin you know with like uh the
        1:24:07
    work of enrique dussell who was reading emmanuel levanos
        1:24:12
    um and you know sorry to point out jeff again but you know
        1:24:17
    talking about the zapatistas right back in the day and um but you know and then nelson maldonado
        1:24:23
    torres walter mignolo eduardo mendieta uh in these folks who really talk about
        1:24:29
    the difference so much of their work hinges on the difference between decoloniality and
        1:24:35
    decolonization so i had to look at the window my family is getting back right now they had to go to seattle for
        1:24:40
    medical issues um so they're about to roll in the front door so
        1:24:47
    i'm sitting in my office um but you'll get to meet my daughter um but um
        1:24:52
    but yeah you know i i think uh you know it what i think that
        1:25:00
    in the field of like post-colonial studies um hold on i actually gotta
        1:25:05
    unlock the door okay
        1:25:13
    um sorry about that hey um
        1:25:19
    okay um sorry my daughter just said i gotta peed
        1:25:25
    um okay where was i but thinking about um decolonial justice you know when you look at like
        1:25:31
    post-colonial studies traditionally speaking there's never anything to do with um
        1:25:36
    indigenous people of turtle island or north america and um
        1:25:41
    i think that we're doing some good work there but i love this distinction between colonialism and
        1:25:47
    coloniality right so when eve tuck and ke wayne yang published their manifesto
        1:25:53
    decolonization is not a metaphor it's about land back right it's about real political processing i absolutely
        1:26:00
    100 agree with all of that but what i find so valuable about coloniality as opposed to colonialism is that it's the
        1:26:07
    song that lives on long after the instrument is gone right and we know that in north america in the
        1:26:13
    united states and canada there's nothing post about colonialism at all there's nothing posed by colonials in the united
        1:26:18
    states and in fact talking to wim last night you know i told him um you know that
        1:26:23
    there's actually a starting point that i think we need to adopt i didn't really articulate it originally i was going to include that in this talk but instead i
        1:26:29
    thought i decided to end with people singing in the earth but um there's there's a um there's a truth
        1:26:37
    that we haven't come to terms with yet with uh in this in this country and i actually get this from foucault
        1:26:43
    who gave a series of lectures publishes society must be defended and in that in those lectures he makes this really
        1:26:50
    provocative thesis that he's right on target with and that is that the state is not born with the cessation of war
        1:26:55
    but it's codified in the mud and blood of war and you know you can look at the us constitution you can i mean things
        1:27:01
    like the three-fifths compromise clause you know um things like apartheid jim crow laws in
        1:27:06
    the united states so you know we've got that connection with uh black lives matters and the vicious legacies of
        1:27:12
    white supremacy um but also the whole entire history of federal indian law right uh and and so when we're talking
        1:27:18
    about decolonizing we're talking about colonial justice i think one we gotta remember we we can't adopt peace as our
        1:27:25
    starting point and and and i said this i said this recently at a talk actually
        1:27:30
    during a q a during a talk uh it was somebody else's talk i asked this question and i was misinterpreted so i'm
        1:27:37
    not saying right in in front of the peace and justice studies association i'm not saying that we have to take a
        1:27:44
    footing a war footing and and our struggles for decoloniality i'm saying the war precedes us
        1:27:50
    right we're we start in the middle of war in the wake of the catastrophic the disastrous we're not starting from peace
        1:27:56
    that was the problem with plato's republic right plato's republic it starts out of nowhere out of this
        1:28:03
    impossible fantasy of peace they just lost the peloponnesian war the spartans had killed 5 000 of their greatest you
        1:28:10
    know men it was in the concrete wake of war and devastation that he articulates
        1:28:16
    plato's republic um so i i think that's where we need to um
        1:28:22
    uh uh head out and uh or that that's one of the beginning parts of this the other
        1:28:28
    related to decolonial justice is this notion of coloniality why i think phenomenology becomes so important and
        1:28:34
    it goes back again to you know what are the terms of decolonial justice and how does that become legible
        1:28:41
    to people because as long as we are educated through a subtle or
        1:28:47
    colonial ontology of truth um there's so much wisdom there's so
        1:28:52
    much there's so many qualities of indigenous or illiterate tradition that just won't be heard um diana uh what's
        1:28:59
    her name diana taylor coined this term percepticide right and and and a book about the dirt
        1:29:05
    the the dirty war in argentina and um and you know she the perceptive side in that sense is when she's talking about
        1:29:11
    uh that famous photograph of the woman sitting in the cafe and right outside the window and the glass the police are
        1:29:18
    beating the crap out of this guy and this spectacle of disappearance and um and but then my friend my friend and
        1:29:25
    she says what does that do to you like what does that do to you that was one of the effectiveness of the dirty war is that it made us turn away well we're
        1:29:32
    still doing that with indigenous people on the one hand we're just turning away uh but on the other hand um you know if
        1:29:37
    missing and murdered indigenous women black lives matter the same thing i mean you know the so much there's just so much turning away but then at simchi and
        1:29:44
    colleague of mine michael d'angeli um she adopts that notion of percepticide
        1:29:49
    and she says um that uh when she she is a very famous dance
        1:29:55
    group get hyatt's people of the copper shield and they go all over the world dancing and she said to me one time when
        1:30:00
    i dance in front of non-indigenous audiences i can literally feel myself disappear in front of their eyes
        1:30:06
    and what she means is that what they see is costumes they don't see real protocol as an expression of
        1:30:12
    sovereignty they don't see real ceremony as an expression of jurisdiction right they see costumes and they see museum
        1:30:20
    pieces um and then of course i take that notion of percepticide and i read it through a levanosian lens because levanos will
        1:30:27
    talk about how that notion of perception harbors within it the the etymology of the word capera meaning to seize which
        1:30:34
    is why he makes this whole critique of a consciousness of seeing um and that uh
        1:30:40
    you you know i i think that phenomenologically speaking you know in our really embodied sense uh
        1:30:47
    that uh non-indigenous people don't have the wherewithal
        1:30:52
    to actually hear what's going on um and yeah i i think that's that's all
        1:30:58
    part of it a friend of mine a klinget friend of mine uh clene lance twitter he came into my office one day uh just him
        1:31:05
    and i closed the door we always complain about coloniality in our institution
        1:31:11
    and he said to me he said they beat about he's talking about the boarding school experiences he said they beat our language out of us and they replaced it
        1:31:17
    with a language that hates us and he told me that like four or five years ago i've been thinking about it
        1:31:23
    ever since and this is why i think phenomenology is so important here and and then i discovered this beautiful
        1:31:29
    phrase by gayatri spivak in a in an essay she talks about the micrological
        1:31:36
    textures of power the micrological textures of power the power that cuts
        1:31:42
    through the inner contours of self and affects what we see what we perceive in
        1:31:47
    this world um and i and and i think that that's that's one that's such an important area
        1:31:53
    where decolonial justice has to be effectuated it has to be at the phenomenological level it has to be at
        1:31:58
    the micrological level because micrological percepticide enables macrological genocide
        1:32:05
    right so sorry i just like went off and we're losing people but well i love it i love it thank you but
        1:32:11
    yes we should give others a chance yeah so i'm gonna jump on pushpa's comment or
        1:32:17
    your answer to pushpa um i wish i could stay here all night and talk about
        1:32:22
    the colonial justice with you but i've been in my office since 7 30 and i have to go home soon
        1:32:29
    but um when you talked about language and having your language beaten
        1:32:36
    out of you and it's replaced with a language that hates you
        1:32:43
    i had this flash on a poem by amiri baraka which is called an agony as now
        1:32:50
    and the opening line is i am in someone who hates me i look out from his eyes smell what
        1:32:58
    fouled tunes come into his breath love his wretched women
        1:33:04
    and then it goes on and there in that poem i think he's talking about the same thing that you're talking about with
        1:33:10
    this percepticide and what happens um i mean i've had that feeling you're
        1:33:16
    standing in front of a group of people you're giving a paper you can literally feel yourself disappear [Music]
        1:33:22
    and so i was um i was very struck and moved by your entire presentation
        1:33:27
    um next year in milwaukee we'll get together and stay up all night
        1:33:33
    and drink whiskey and talk about the colonial justice
        1:33:39
    but for now um i haven't seen my husband since 6 30 and i think he'd like for me to come
        1:33:45
    home and i know i would like to come home so thank you very much thank you you touched me and
        1:33:52
    i want to talk phenomenology too because i i agree phenomenology is incredibly important this whole notion of embodied
        1:34:00
    everything that um the west doesn't understand and
        1:34:06
    this is very much in uh very present in the work that i've been doing in afrofuturism and
        1:34:12
    with west african oral traditions and all of that so thank you very much i'm
        1:34:18
    so pleased that you accepted our invitation um um it was it was
        1:34:25
    delightful seems too small but thank you thank you thank you very much
        1:34:36
    thank you for sharing from the heart of the mountain and the heart of the people yeah right on i do
        1:34:45
    that's cool and i too have been a long time up so i'm heading off now awesome thanks i
        1:34:51
    didn't think i'd hear more cherokee that's cool
        1:34:57
    if if we want to have one last question um
        1:35:03
    then we can end the recording after that one um i guess the promise if there's
        1:35:10
    if everybody's just ready to hang out um then we can call call an end to the
        1:35:18
    formal recorded part of the discourse i can ask a question thanks um that was
        1:35:24
    a beautiful presentation really moving um i was a little surprised when you mentioned that on your on the journey
        1:35:32
    uh did i understand correctly that it was someone who was working on the trail who was actually kind of denying the
        1:35:40
    the seriousness of this and the reality the veracity of it and the extent of it and i'm wondering if you pushed back
        1:35:47
    against that a little bit because it's it's concerning that on a trail like this there's somebody
        1:35:54
    employed there who's like mitigating it
        1:35:59
    so i'm just curious how you handled that yeah i appreciate that question a lot because it's kind of funny um
        1:36:05
    so it was the hawasi river cultural heritage center as far as i know
        1:36:11
    it has nothing to do with like the park service or the the you know in terms of the the official trail of tears route
        1:36:17
    and all of that um in fact she told us that um that
        1:36:22
    you know there was basically utter historical erasure in that area so like like i said there's nothing about no
        1:36:28
    remnants of forecasts and all that and she said that uh community members in that area wanted to get together and and
        1:36:34
    offer some sort of memorialization of the violence and the atrocities that had happened there i mean that really was
        1:36:39
    sort of ground zero of the removal and um and uh so but it's funny
        1:36:46
    because we uh she said that and we're in there and my dad looks at me my daughter looks
        1:36:54
    at me and we just got okay and i kind of let i just let it go and we walked out and my
        1:37:01
    dad as soon as we get out the door he's like i'm so proud of you son i could tell you were gonna go off and i thought
        1:37:08
    oh no oh no here it goes so i actually didn't i actually didn't
        1:37:15
    engage her um yeah yeah because i just i didn't want that bad social energy to
        1:37:21
    hang on to us when we got back into the car and continued on but i did talk with barbara duncan about
        1:37:26
    the experience uh and she couldn't believe it uh either but but this woman who did say
        1:37:33
    all this stuff to us you know at one point right before he left she says you know oh yeah they remember the removal
        1:37:38
    bike raiders come through here whenever they come through here you know we feed them and i tell them these stories and
        1:37:43
    they always leave crying and when we get back to the car i said well they're probably crying because she's telling him this awful history
        1:37:49
    [Laughter] but yeah that that was that was the extent of it
        1:37:57
    but yeah i'm sure you explained to your daughter i i mean i'm sure it sounds like uh your
        1:38:03
    daughter learned so much on the trip as well and that you know it was just another case of
        1:38:09
    denial in many in some you know it sounds like on on the woman's part and
        1:38:15
    uh and yeah exactly exactly and my daughter i didn't
        1:38:22
    even have to correct it to my daughter once we got in the car she knew what was all wrong about that story um but then of course it was later on
        1:38:28
    that day that we encountered the nancy the daughters of the american revolution and their memorial for nancy ward
        1:38:34
    uh and uh you know so this woman at the hawasi heritage center
        1:38:39
    i mean she's one little you know piece in this uh counter memory
        1:38:45
    um historical erasure uh so you know it's it she needs to be corrected but not
        1:38:52
    scapegoated you know it's just ubiquitous good for you thank you i've learned so much tonight thank
        1:38:58
    you very much thank you thank you awesome so can i just say for uh before we end
        1:39:06
    just how absolutely honored i was uh to to be here and to be part of this today
        1:39:13
    and uh to have you speak about me like that really uh touches me very deeply it feels uh
        1:39:20
    like things that happened to you very uh non-coincidental um and
        1:39:26
    so it is a coming together of many things and and i just want to say uh how how moved i am at how far you've
        1:39:33
    taken philosophy into ethics into the very heart of ethics and and begun to understand the
        1:39:40
    the world in that way and and i have so much to learn uh from you and the space
        1:39:46
    that you have created um so so thank you and and i can't wait
        1:39:51
    to to learn about that yeah thank you so much jeff i mean seriously like you
