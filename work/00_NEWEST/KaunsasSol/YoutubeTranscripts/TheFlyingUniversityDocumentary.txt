    we want to get them get back into the
        1:40
    community in a strong healthy and
        1:42
    supported way so that they do not
        1:44

        2:18
    been taking the class for about three
        2:21
    years now ever since pretty much the I
        2:23
    miss the first one but then everyone
        2:25
    after that we've been doing a lot of
        2:29
    different types of classes like we did a
        2:31
    Stello like we're doing right now we've
        2:34
    done existentialism the study on that
        2:36
    and we've done literature born on
        2:41
    struggle the V for Vendetta that was a
        2:45
    good one ionic means it's an accented

    among the day's activities is reading
        3:19
    lost scenes or fictitious scenes that
        3:21
    the students have composed themselves
        3:24
    never piss you off cuz you got some
        3:27
    serious issues for real but I like it
        3:30

        3:32
    looking out for your set and your little

    Galindo are among a group of some 50
        3:54
    students who began taking classes on the
        3:55
    inside there now for of about a dozen
        3:58
    former inmates enrolled at UAS Galindo
        4:02
    is one of the flying University's
        4:04
    original students these are going good
        4:06
    you know somebody called me a
        4:08
    and I beat the brakes off which now I
        4:12
    know that's not the way you approach
        4:15
    racism
        4:21
    but it did set me on the path right I
        4:23
    got to meets alright so not only I
        4:24
    would've been in school but it was a lot
        4:26
    harder right saw but they put me put
        4:28
    this whole thing in motion this whole
        4:30
    fine university thing wouldn't exist
        4:31
    without salt right it wouldn't never
        4:34
    know this wouldn't exist without salt
        4:36
    because he paved this this path of a
        4:40
    fellowship you know through education
        4:46
    right it's not based on anything it's
        4:47
    based on education like here we're gonna
        4:49
    read some cool stuff we're going to talk
        4:51
    about it so if it probably wasn't
        4:53
    without a my probably some heroin might
        4:55
    be honest with you I probably be coming
        4:58
    to school and doing bad things and
        5:00
    trying to come to school go back to
        5:02
    prison
        5:02
    go back to California doing my probably
        5:05
    dead who knows a lot of bad things
        5:07
    evilness the flying University has
        5:13
    historical origins in the Soviet Union
        5:17
    actually my teacher Martin Mateus dick
        5:20
    was a young philosophy student in
        5:24
    Czechoslovakia when the Soviet tanks
        5:27
    rolled in in 1968 and they began to take
        5:31
    up secret illegal philosophy courses
        5:35
    they were taught by Yann Patoka lots of
        5:38
    Havel was in attendance and Martin
        5:40
    Mateus tick was one of the one of their
        5:42
    students in 1977 Havel and potato chica
        5:47
    drafted the charter 77 human rights
        5:49
    agreement and Mart Matusik was one of
        5:51
    the student signatories of that well
        5:54
    that brought a lot of attention by the
        5:56
    secret police to them and in 1978 their
        5:59
    secret philosophy courses which they
        6:02
    called the fine University were raided
        6:05
    by the secret police and the toge kid
        6:08
    died from his interrogation wounds so he
        6:10
    died a Socratic death right he died at
        6:12
    the hands of the state for corrupting to
        6:13
    youth and Mateus dick he had to flee and
        6:17
    he ended up in the United States and I
        6:21
    became his student and I spent some time
        6:25
    studying in Czech Republic with him
        6:27
    I read Havel and Levin us and these
        6:29
    folks who shaped his own academic
        6:32
    genealogy
        6:34
    and so the first semester when I started
        6:38
    teaching Havel and Lebanon inside the
        6:39
    prison and I told them the story of the
        6:41
    flying university they were really taken
        6:44
    by that and then the following semester
        6:45
    when Martin Matusik and Patricia
        6:47
    Huntington came into the prison that's
        6:48
    when the guys decided we want to call
        6:50
    what we're doing here
        6:51
    the flying university right back in
        6:54
    prison
        6:54
    nealy arranged for Kathryn would key to
        6:57
    join the class she's a professional
        6:59
    actor playing Desdemona in perseverance
        7:02
    theaters production of Othello give me
        7:09
    your hand no no no sorrow liberal heart
        7:19
    hot hot the guys that that are going to
        7:23
    the class they enjoy it a lot and they
        7:25
    they seem to get stuff out of it it's
        7:27
    fun because if they they'll take a
        7:30
    they'll take like one usually what
        7:32
    happens is they they'll come in I'll
        7:33
    take all the vote tech classes they can
        7:35
    get and then they discover that Paul and
        7:37
    I aren't so bad so then they'll start to
        7:39
    take the other classes that are more the
        7:43
    social type classes and and that's good
        7:46
    because they learn how to talk to people
        7:48
    because they forget how to I mean
        7:49
    they'll they'll tell you that themselves
        7:51
    you know it's like how do you interact
        7:52
    with the women when I haven't seen
        7:54
    really any women you know even you know
        7:56
    cos you don't react the same way or you
        7:59
    know have the same type of relationship
        8:00
    you would with somebody that you see on
        8:01
    the street or you know things like that
        8:03
    so it's it's good that they have that
        8:06
    interaction I think I think it's a it's
        8:08
    a soft skill things that they don't
        8:10
    learn or forget about but most the time
        8:13
    I think they probably haven't learned
        8:14
    them you know that that stuff gets
        8:17
    integrated into it and then maybe
        8:18
    they'll go to college you know who got
        8:20
    guys that we're in here and now go into
        8:22
    college full time because I'll help them
        8:24
    do the FAFSA applications and things
        8:26
    like that too so last day of the flying
        8:30
    University when we were getting all of
        8:32
    our certificates we're eating the Dorian
        8:36

        8:47

        8:59

        9:01

        9:03

        9:05

        9:32
    a younger and sweating devil here that
        9:35
    commonly rebels to say good hand a frank
        9:39
    one indeed say so before twas that hand
        9:43
    that gave away my heart you know people
        9:44
    looking at Sullivan they're like wow he
        9:46
    changes so quickly and like that
        9:48
    jealousy and sickness take hold of him
        9:50
    so fast but really like you know coming
        9:55
    just having come on with this very
        9:57
    brutal war and coming home to a new wife
        10:00
    who he's probably known very much
        10:02
    shorter time than Iago eventually got it
        10:09
    yeah I got to the halfway house and I
        10:11

        10:40
    money to go to school pay back well
        10:48
    charge it to later well that's this used
        10:51
    to be the question if
        10:52
    that affects everybody right no one
        10:56
    thinks that they can pay for it no they
        10:58
    don't even know about fast
        11:00

        11:04
    idea I had no idea about faster I had no
        11:06

        11:09
    ever go to college I mean like like
        11:12
    hardly anybody in my family has ever
        11:14
    been to college so like it it seemed
        11:17
    like a pretty far-out thing for me you
        11:20
    know and definitely with my background
        11:21
    and my criminal history
        11:31

        13:34
    and it's basically okay so like what
        13:40
    were you gonna say nothing you know we
        13:44
    waited around for long this stuff is
        13:46
    good it brings people in that normally
        13:49
    would not come in they can see that
        13:51
    they're just like everybody else the
        13:54
    guys are in here I mean the guys in who
        13:56
    did something bad but you know there's
        13:58
    guys in here that we're good until they
        14:00
    were 35 45 years old and made one
        14:03
    mistake and that was a big mistake and
        14:04
    now they're in here for a long time so
        14:07
    it doesn't you know when one bad
        14:09
    decision can just screw your life up big
        14:11
    time you know and it's not just your
        14:14
    freedom you lose you lose your house and
        14:17
    you lose all your stuff - II had you
        14:19
    know your close your family your dog
        14:22
    your not whatever you had it's gone so
        14:25
    imagine all that stuff gone you're in
        14:26
    here for two or three months some
        14:28
    and cleans all your stuff out you get
        14:31
    out now you don't have a house now your
        14:34
    family doesn't want anything to do with
        14:35
    you you know all your possessions from
        14:38
    silverware to books to whatever you had
        14:42
    you don't have that anymore and you're
        14:44
    supposed to get out and get a job and
        14:45
    meet your pio and you know go to drug
        14:47
    and alcohol class and and be good and
        14:49
    not be stressed and if you're stressed
        14:51
    learn how to not be stressed so that you
        14:53
    don't really want to go back and drink
        14:54
    because you know that's not a good idea
        14:55
    cuz that's what's got you in here in the
        14:57
    first place yeah it's not stressful at
        14:59
    all I got out and then you know it's
        15:08
    like my first experience you know like
        15:10
    realizing what it is to be a felon go I
        15:15
    apply it every job possible I think that
        15:18
    you know I have a good resume and that
        15:20
    but once you check that felon box it's
        15:22
    like I don't matter what your resume
        15:24
    looks like you know once you check that
        15:27
    it's own box people are automatically
        15:29
    assume you know well what kind of person
        15:33
    you are really look at this as a shared
        15:35
    responsibility that it's shared with
        15:37
    first of all the inmate certainly the
        15:40
    inmate has to take responsibility for
        15:42
    their actions but then we have to have a
        15:45
    responsibility in do-si to make sure we
        15:48
    give them opportunities to improve those
        15:51
    behaviors to deal with the the aspects
        15:55
    of their life through you know trauma in
        15:57
    their lives of being raised in an
        16:00
    alcoholic home you know victims of child
        16:02
    abuse you know poor education whatever
        16:06
    the case may be
        16:07
    we have an opportunity and I think a
        16:09
    responsibility to help build up those
        16:12
    deficits so that they can be successful
        16:15
    and then the final part of the
        16:18
    responsibility is the communities again
        16:20
    communities have got to help us and help
        16:24
    the inmate have a smooth transition back
        16:27
    because again they are from these
        16:30
    communities they are members of these
        16:31
    communities this is where they most
        16:33
    often grew up and live
        16:35
    and and went through their lives local
        16:38
    administration here and jr. are doing
        16:40
    great I think they're doing great I
        16:42
    haven't had any problems with them
        16:43
    except they took me like a joke 15 15
        16:45
    minutes late which is a technicality and
        16:47
    I understand it I'm not mad brent brent
        16:52
    has been awesome he's been nothing but
        16:54
    good to me um he let I mean I went to
        16:57
    Vermont to help talk about the fine
        16:59
    University right and I'm still on parole
        17:01
    parole
        17:02
    I got peeled water he's been nothing but
        17:04
    helpful for me you know she's been
        17:07
    nothing but good and encouraging before
        17:12
    that I had peeled morning it was my
        17:13
    institutional Pio and he's been nothing
        17:16
    but good and encouraging haven't had any
        17:18
    problems with these guys right now I
        17:40
    think it's worth noting that the program
        17:43
    cost no money it's all volunteer so
        17:47
    there's no tax burden or anything like
        17:49
    that what I would like to see in five or
        17:53
    ten years the flying University become
        17:55
    is in a prison education program that
        17:59
    actually Awards University credit that
        18:02
    would be a tremendous achievement I
        18:05
    believe and we do have some support for
        18:08
    that on campus and with our
        18:09
    administration these guys right now they
        18:12
    get certificates of completion some of
        18:14
    them are designated with distinction
        18:15
    that goes into their files and if they
        18:19
    need a letter of recommendation from me
        18:21
    I'm happy to do it if it's for their
        18:22
    parole board or for the guys coming out
        18:25
    of UAS I just wrote a letter of
        18:26
    recommendation for one of our guys just
        18:30
    this week you know so I can give that
        18:32
    kind of incentive but if they could get
        18:34
    college credit I think that would be
        18:36
    even more meaningful for their lives we
        18:40
    know that education is a critical
        18:43
    component of successful
        18:46
    reentry that education is one of the
        18:49
    most critical pieces if they do not have
        18:52
    education and skills to be able to go
        18:54
    back out into the community and and
        18:56
    compete then they're most likely going
        18:59
    to fail the fine university is unique in
        19:01
    the state and it's because of the
        19:04
    resources available in Juneau those
        19:06
    resources vary in the communities that
        19:08
    house the other dozen correctional
        19:10
    facilities and their educational
        19:12
    programs should reflect those community
        19:15
    strengths whether they be vocational
        19:17
    academic or otherwise come now your
        19:24
    promise what promise Chuck I sent a bit
        19:29
    cassio come speak with you I have a salt
        19:32
    and sorry reason a friend offends me
        19:37
    offends me lend me thy handkerchief
        19:39
    Neely says his work with the flying
        19:42
    University is fulfilling but there is
        19:45
    something more the first thing we have
        19:47
    to do is completely reimagine how we
        19:50
    understand justice I mean that's the
        19:53
    heart of it right there we need to think
        19:56
    about justice not in terms of
        19:58
    retribution but something that is more
        20:01
    along the lines of restorative justice
        20:03
    but even restorative justice is
        20:05
    difficult to talk about with some people
        20:09
    because what is it that you're restoring
        20:10
    there is nothing there to restore it in
        20:13
    the first place
        20:13
    it's hard to talk about rehabilitation
        20:15
    if some people have never been
        20:17
    habilitated we have one young man who
        20:19
    was a participant in the flying
        20:21
    university who published a poem and our
        20:23
    first publication of poetry written by
        20:26
    inmates and it's a heart-wrenching poem
        20:29
    in which he talks about his father
        20:32
    locking him inside of a freezer just to
        20:34
    see if he would freeze or to throw him
        20:36
    against the wall to see if he would
        20:38
    break in fact in Vermont I read this
        20:40
    poem out loud and Here I am in front of
        20:42
    an auditorium full of people and I could
        20:44
    barely hold my tears back I mean every
        20:46
    time I read this poem
        20:47
    it just really wrenches at my heart how
        20:50
    do you rehabilitate somebody who has
        20:52
    never been habilitated so I think
        20:55
    fundamentally reimagining how we
        20:57
    understand justice
        20:58
    is the first thing that the community
        21:00
    really needs to do
        21:02
    perhaps Gonzalez Galindo Jessup Johnson
        21:06
    bla and the rest of the flying
        21:08
    University can help effect this change
        21:10
    through education not everything is
        21:13
    possible nothing is impossible
        21:15
    so if we just go through the right to do
        21:18
    the right process we can become educated
        21:21
    and we can educate the said community
        21:22
    and we can be anything
        21:38
    all right my name is Saul and in my time
        21:42
    capsule for 100 years I would I would
        21:45
    say the prison industrial complex has
        21:48
    been abolished and there used to be
        21:51
    these things called prisons but not
        21:55
    anymore build community
    No results found
