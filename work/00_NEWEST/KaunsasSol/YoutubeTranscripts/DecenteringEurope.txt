    ya see on the garden to eat you welcome
        2:05
    to our panel what's up Brittany
        2:12
    D century in Europe student critical meditations on indigeneity and
        2:17
    interdisciplinarity about three hours ago my ears started feeling like there's
        2:24
    cotton in them right now so if I'm like yelling or if I'm not hearing you signal
        2:29
    okay my name is Saul Neely I'm an associate professor of English and
        2:35
    philosophy here at UAS and a citizen of the Cherokee Nation it is with pleasure that I introduce and
        2:42
    moderate this panel of students today who are here to deliver their personal critical meditations on our coursework
        2:49
    which is the title of the panel suggests concerns itself with fostering a rich
        2:54
    interdisciplinarity inspired and sustained by appeal to what Ernestine
        2:59
    Hays calls indigenous intellectual Authority in a moment I will acknowledge each of the student presenters and
        3:05
    before they present they will take a moment to introduce themselves and in class last night we decided that's how
        3:10
    we wanted to do it I'm not just trying to be rude and put the burden on them they said I will introduce ourselves
        3:16
    before we get going I want to look at this quotation from the UN's Economic
        3:23
    and Social Council issued in 1994 it comes from their principles and guidelines for the protection of the
        3:29
    heritage of indigenous peoples and it reads the effective protection of the heritage of the indigenous peoples of
        3:36
    the world benefits all humanity cultural diversity is essential to the
        3:41
    adaptability and creativity of the human species as a whole this panel begins by
        3:47
    taking the latter part of this principle seriously by appealing to indigenous knowledge as central to healing a world
        3:55
    scarred by colonialism capitalism and perpetual war and the program is a typo
        4:01
    it says scared by colonialism capitalism perpetual or white supremacy
        4:11
    fundamentally fails to see its own cultural impoverishment and we're not just talking about the species of white
        4:17
    supremacy stoked by Trump and his base but all the variations and intensities of white supremacy including the sac
        4:24
    realization of stem or the sub or the kind of white supremacy submerged in decisions that
        4:30
    for instance don't accept Alaskan native ecological knowledge as a ger in the
        4:35
    natural sciences I also want to say something about the class as well the
        4:41
    official title of our Hume 200 class is orientation to the liberal arts it is a class required by all BL a students
        4:49
    historically is the class that introduces the liberal arts the class is focused on their European origins this
        4:56
    means the class has traditionally introduced students to the seven so-called liberal arts as organized in
        5:02
    medieval Europe but which were first taught in ancient Greece or lake antiquity these include the lower
        5:07
    division liberal arts known as the Trivium grammar rhetoric and logic as well as the upper division known as the
        5:13
    quadrivium or arithmetic geometry music and astronomy together these seven
        5:18
    liberal arts prepared students for the study philosophy in theology in medieval Europe you can see of course it's such a
        5:23
    curriculum for Hume 200 is thoroughly Eurocentric and more important it can be imported anywhere in different to place
        5:30
    a colleague once said to me the university is a place and my response was to suggest that a university is a
        5:37
    space yes but it is a space that puts place under erasure when we simply
        5:44
    import a liberal arts curriculum anywhere including mingi Donnie we put
        5:49
    the wisdom of that place including the history of its arts governance science medicine technology ecology management
        5:57
    right notice the interdisciplinary innuendo here under erasure in this case
        6:03
    the liberal arts curriculum usurps that indigenous intellectual history and authority of place but over the past
        6:09
    couple of years a group of faculty have been working to create a robust interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts that
        6:14
    candy Center Eurocentrism and bring back into sustained focus a concern for the
        6:20
    indigenous languages cultures and practices of Sangha Donnie the assumption in this work is that UAS can
        6:27
    be and ought to be a world-class destination for critical Indigenous Studies Pacific Northwest Coast Arts and
        6:34
    Alaskan native studies as we began to craft the degree we proposed an idea to
        6:39
    a series of 200 300 400 level interdisciplinary studies courses that would allow students to continually
        6:45
    reflect on the interdisciplinary quality of their work in a cohort environment as
        6:51
    I designed by Hume 200 course I began to arise it as if I were already teaching
        6:56
    inds 200 to that end we've moved this semester through a series of critical
        7:01
    texts and meditations that take up at once a concern for interdisciplinarity and indigeneity for example rather than
        7:08
    beginning with Plato or Aristotle we started with Robert bring her sand oscar Quigley in fact it wasn't until week six
        7:15
    that we even turned to thinkers rooted in European genealogies in addition and as is typical of my broader experience
        7:22
    at UAS these students the students here who come from diverse backgrounds and
        7:27
    experiences and interests have really taken up the challenges of this course to remarkable and edifying effect and I
        7:34
    want to be clear here we assemble this panel as a kind of political intervention students on this panel all
        7:41
    agree that we are all better served when we restore indigenous intellectual authority to this institution situated
        7:47
    on this place where we regularly offer land acknowledgement to the Occoquan but
        7:52
    unless we take this task seriously we all of us who has anything to do with this institution are only usurpers but
        8:00
    here's what important here's what's important about this panel in this moment when I attempted to start an Honors Program UAS that began with a
        8:06
    privilege of interdisciplinarity and ingenuity I was told that natural science science students wouldn't be
        8:13
    interested and that was wrong the last two spring honor symposia I organized were mostly attended by
        8:19
    Natural Science students who absolutely loved and were inspired by the indigenous content to those courses in
        8:25
    this Hume 200 course we work toward similar ends to sustain a robust
        8:31
    engagement with indigenous inspiration that reveal at once the limits of Eurocentric methodologies which so
        8:37
    frequently are carried by impoverished notions of self possessive individuality instrumental rationality and a
        8:44
    positivism that forces all other knowledge systems to account for themselves in its own terms
        8:49
    so in what follows students will present a seer of short meditations on their own
        8:55
    experiences and I think you will be struck by the critical sophistication
        9:01
    articulated by these students and it's remember it's just a lower division
        9:06
    class right we haven't even like got into sort of the upper division focus on
        9:12
    some of this this work so this is really good in order we're gonna have Kevin Jones talk give a talk relationship
        9:20
    respect and responsibility cast Chase will talk about the privilege of
        9:26
    attending UAS PK will give a talk met her meditations are titled the
        9:32
    importance of the arts and interdisciplinary education we'll follow that with Joe the importance of
        9:37
    indigenous knowledge through environmental and political science with in today's curriculum and then Ray our
        9:43
    modern day he'll mark ooza Foucault and the hope offered by indigeneity and finally Clare helgesson on movement and
        9:50
    transformation and Indigenous Studies so let's welcome the students Oklahoma and
        10:04
    I'm coming back to university after many years of doing many different things
        10:09
    throughout the world and I'm so glad to be here and thank you for allowing me to
        10:14
    read these words relationship respect and responsibility Cloney ilysm has been
        10:21
    used in the West for decades to create economic political social education and legal policies designed by the dominant
        10:28
    culture to exert its control over indigenous peoples and lands that which counts as quote scientific knowledge as
        10:34
    is defined by the dominant knowledge system recognized here in the West is based on a strict set of rules that are
        10:41
    then used to define what does or does not qualify the dominant knowledge system of the West leaves no room for
        10:47
    traditional logic logic knowledge viewing it as quote superstitions myths
        10:52
    or belief systems based on ignorance end quote in our arrogance we refuse to even
        10:58
    contemplate the idea that there could be any truth or validity within these other ways of knowing we categorically deny
        11:04
    the possibility that there are many ways of being in and seeing the world around us unless of
        11:10
    course there is knowledge that that can be used for financial gain but this is the case we are more than happy to
        11:16
    practice bio colonialism seeking out and discovering valued genetic resources
        11:22
    which are then removed and turned into private and intellectual property locked up tight by the corporations
        11:28
    universities and other entities that seek to exploit them these powers are even willing to do harm to the cultures
        11:34
    that assisted them in obtaining this knowledge power has no conscious and holds only contempt for anything that
        11:40
    that does not service indigenous knowledge recognizes that there is more than one dimension to the world we live
        11:46
    in as Laura Inland states quote the richness of indigenous commitment epistemological pluralism lies in the
        11:53
    recognition that there are diverse ways of being in the natural world and so diverse experiences to appreciate and
        12:00
    respect some of these may be shared although they are not to be appropriated access to other ways of knowing is
        12:06
    something that must be given not taketh within indigenous knowledge systems the
        12:12
    knowledge is something which is closely tied to experience in relationship both the N into the physical and spiritual
        12:18
    world visions dreams and interspecies communications are not discarded as quote nonsensical and fabrications but
        12:26
    are seen as being an integral part of the human experience this stands in stark contrast to the Western view of
        12:31
    knowledge based on the concept of positivism which only gives credence to that which can be scientifically
        12:37
    verified or which is capable of logical or mathematical proof
        12:42
    indigenous knowledge is passed down from generation to generation through stories
        12:47
    these stories allow us to have a better understanding of the world around us they teach us about relationships quote
        12:54
    they met a son access to perspectives often very different from our own in quotes stories helped it teach us how to
        13:01
    best navigate the world how to act in a responsible way that respects the diversity of the world around us
        13:07
    they helped us to understand that each and every being is a value and worthy of respect each entity has a unique
        13:14
    contribution to make and these in turn help maintain the balance of the natural world these stories are based on generations
        13:20
    of experience and carry empirical knowledge about the relationships that connect us to the world and to one
        13:25
    another and quote about how these relationships can be well or adversely
        13:31
    affected we do not exist separate from the world around us or from each other
        13:37
    each actually take has an effect on the world and the people around us whether we wish it or not we learn to understand
        13:43
    the world around us through relationships it is when we attempt to remove ourselves from this relatedness
        13:49
    that we lose sight of the fact that our fates and futures are intertwined even
        13:55
    if we choose not to or fail to recognize it we cannot exist outside of this relationship these relationships to the
        14:02
    people in the world around us are not something that just exists they bring with them mutual obligations and responsibilities all beings sentient and
        14:11
    non-sentient possess life the most precious gift and are thus worthy of respect the Iroquois before refer to
        14:19
    this as quote the wish to be appreciated the fundamental shared perception the first principle of existence in quote as
        14:27
    long as everything is appreciated for what it is for what it does just to say
        14:32
    sustain the cycle of creation the world will be in balance and life will continue no form of life on this planet
        14:39
    nor the planet is itself is expendable the only way to understand this completely is to have an active and
        14:45
    intimate relationship with the entirety of our surroundings we need to respect and appreciate the
        14:51
    contributions of all beings on this planet that all beings on this planet make and how our actions impact all of
        14:58
    this which sums us up as follows quote given the affiliation affiliation all
        15:03
    ties that bind humans to the nonhumans to the land and all of its constituent beings respect is the most fitting and
        15:10
    revealing moral response it requires constant attentiveness to the value of something or someone appreciation of the
        15:17
    fact that each individual has its own unique contribution to make which is vital to the natural order awareness of
        15:25
    the constraints and limitations which characterize characterize and contextualize it
        15:30
    and gratitude for all of this in quote it is only by working together using all
        15:36
    of the knowledge we have for the good of all that we will be able to survive in this world the only one we have
        15:41
    traditional Western science is so caught up in advancing its economic and political goals that is lost touch with
        15:48
    its true intent the better the human condition help us understand how our world works and how we can take care of
        15:55
    it end of each other it's perceived superiority makes us bind to all of the wisdom and knowledge that is already in
        16:01
    the world waiting to be heard let us take the time to listen to the stories of those who came before us and in doing
        16:08
    so learn what it takes to walk in the world and to live a life just based on respect of each other and our
        16:14
    surrounding everybody here in the back
        16:27
    yeah okay because I just found a microphone yes I'm Cassandra chase I am
        16:41
    from Gustavus I'll ask I'm in the BA
        16:46
    program with the primary in humanities
        16:53
    which is broken up into art and English and then my secondaries math so it's a little everywhere I kind of love it okay okay today is all about the
        17:04
    elephant in the room recognizing the powers and privileges we do and don't have we're all somewhat privileged and that we are pursuing
        17:10
    higher education for one reason or another or high pursuit whether it be for ourselves or for what is expected of
        17:17
    us from our families friends or society standards I've been thinking about my personal privileges and the privileges
        17:22
    and that lack thereof my degree program I'll be talking about my degree plan and
        17:28
    how I have come to view other degree plans here at UA UAS hundred percent opinion since I've only been in the one
        17:33
    to reply degree program recognizing that when we hear the experiences of those
        17:38
    around us we should take into account the circumstances that surround them
        17:43
    four-year degree is an ideal for everyone my degree will be at least five years that's okay taking more time to
        17:48
    finish a degree program isn't a bad thing during the time you're taking classes you're also increasing your life experiences College is all about
        17:55
    experiences life happens and people have to take breaks from school and that's just how it is some people can't afford
        18:02
    to take breaks from reality your work income is what you pay for everything but it alone pay for the extra year it
        18:08
    might take to complete a bachelor's degree I recognize that while I should not feel guilty for the time I've taken to complete my program I've had the
        18:14
    privilege to attend school as long as I have quote the discipline be more than
        18:20
    influence the structure of University they also influence communication and collaboration patterns among scholars Carrie Holly the very sizing curriculum
        18:29
    offered at this university is a privilege there are many different disciplines and programs in higher education depending on when you enter
        18:35
    the university system your experience in your program will be solely yours plus if you start at the same time as you
        18:41
    they were on the same program took classes different years like Hume 1:20
        18:47
    the teachers for that range so you get hundreds of different experiences UAS
        18:54
    only has a handful of what is offered elsewhere but this doesn't take away from the learning that happens here a sense of place plays a huge part into
        19:00
    what we study here we're a not quantized struggle with the idea of being a
        19:05
    colonist in my own home I thought I came from this place I deserve hate that word to call this place home until I finally
        19:12
    opened my eyes to see that I've been in this land significantly less time than those who came from the land talk about
        19:18
    a dull moment and a benefit to attending a small university as the diversity
        19:23
    appears in your class you could interact with people from different disciplines with different perspectives and
        19:29
    backgrounds and do the population of our school likely have had likelihood of having at least one person per semester
        19:34
    and two of your more classes is very high I'm in like three classes with this from right here which is a privilege of
        19:41
    taken for granted many times now at the part of my degree the VOA program is
        19:48
    kind of a choose-your-own-adventure type thing in my experience with the program you can bring disciplines
        19:54
    together that aren't usually part of one another I'm not confined within normal lines of many degree programs art English and
        20:01
    math they're all part of my degree which doesn't include the liberal arts core which like the foreign language and
        20:07
    stuff like that so you take a year of a foreign language which most of the
        20:14
    options for UAS are Alaska native languages I get to take Alaska native studies classes which are taught through
        20:20
    multiple disciplines are English history anthropology political science through
        20:26
    these classes I will learn how indigenous culture is an integral part of cultures of many countries but unfortunately many people don't know
        20:32
    much about them because they do not get the necessary education um so this may
        20:37
    kind of sound like I'm bashing on math and science degrees but I have part maths I'm not trying to most science
        20:46
    degrees don't include a section on indigenous studies and what we as a university lose as a result of this
        20:53
    there's more to science than Western science more to English than the PWM
        20:59
    dead white man writings and my two cents indigenized the programs hey it's my
        21:15
    turn I don't often speak very loudly so it's just kind of terrifying but can
        21:22
    y'all hear me in the back cool all right so my name is PK and I'm in the process
        21:28
    of completing ela study with focuses on
        21:33
    studio art in the environment so I'm a landscape painter so I'm just sort of
        21:38
    taking this time to during my undergrad
        21:43
    to explore you know studio art and the environment
        21:49
    or astray that through my artwork and I'm going to be discussing the importance of the arts and
        21:56
    interdisciplinary education right so there's a hierarchy of subjects that
        22:01
    exist within our educational institutions this hierarchy values the STEM subjects first which include
        22:08
    science technology engineering and mathematics while the arts are there at the bottom of this hierarchy are not
        22:14
    included at all this devaluing of the arts can be seen throughout our society as budgets for art programs contain
        22:20
    continue to be cut and a stigma against art continues to grow however it is
        22:25
    important to recognize that artistic expression has been and continues to be
        22:30
    a fundamental aspect of the human experience across cultures a more interdisciplinary educational approach
        22:38
    should be taken that recognizes the equal importance of the Arts in STEM
        22:44
    subjects and encourages the collaboration of these subjects rather than competition as an artist I have
        22:50
    experienced the detriment of the social notion firsthand throughout my life I have been discouraged from pursuing an
        22:56
    education within the arts and I still find myself to this day having to defend my choice of pursuing art as a major I
        23:03
    am told that I need to go to college to get a real job so that way I can support
        23:08
    my hobby of doing art art has always been my greatest passion in life and my way of understanding the world around me
        23:14
    having my identity be reduced down to nothing more than a hobby has been a source of distress that has caused me to
        23:21
    greatly question my self-worth and purpose in life devaluing the arts is not only harmful to artists but
        23:27
    two-sided but to society as a whole art is the cultivation of creativity and it
        23:34
    is this creativity that is fundamental to the innovation that takes place within STEM fields of study in the essay
        23:42
    defining interdisciplinarity by Carey a Holly Holly argues that interdisciplinarity Studies is motivated
        23:50
    by two distinct schools of thought quote first interdisciplinary activity is
        23:56
    embedded in an educational framework that advocates a broad integrative curriculum and quotes
        24:02
    and quote a second rationale for interdisciplinary work holds that such knowledge is a postmodern necessity to
        24:09
    solve social problems that cannot be adequately understood through one disciplinary perspective and quote so to
        24:16
    put it simply there are a great deal of problems within our society the most practical approach to solving these
        24:23
    problems is when individuals from different fields of study collaborate with one another towards a common goal
        24:29
    however this collaboration cannot exist without respect for and an understanding of the importance of different fields of
        24:36
    study having artists Wayne pricier at us has been very inspiring to me
        24:41
    his carvings are a great example of how an interdisciplinary approach of art can be used to better understand the world
        24:47
    around us and heals problems that exist within our society in an interview with
        24:53
    the Juno Empire Wayne State's quote a lot of times we as humans don't really
        24:59
    know how to take the first step in a healing process we're very capable of doing it we just don't know how what I
        25:08
    do as an artist is I provide a monument that does just that it provides a step in that direction include recognizing
        25:15
    the important role of art within society will not solve all our problems overnight but it will be a very
        25:21
    necessary step in the right direction it is my hope that uas continues to
        25:26
    recognize the importance of the art was in interdisciplinary education and continues to offer art classes in
        25:32
    addition to a variety of other classes if we as a university can take this stuff towards healing perhaps it will
        25:39
    inspire others to do the same hi
        25:52
    everyone my name is Joe Greene oh I'm a student here at U is getting my
        25:57
    undergraduate getting a Bachelors of Liberal Arts with an emphasis in history political science and environmental
        26:04
    science so today the title of my speech is the importance of indigenous knowledge through environmental and
        26:10
    political science with in today's curriculum
        26:15
    through through a lens of power and privilege today I want to talk to everyone about the importance of
        26:20
    indigenous knowledge my question to everyone today is can indigenous knowledge systems contribute to a way to
        26:28
    to the ways of contemporary science in education while some might disagree I
        26:34
    argue that indigenous knowledge is powerful and holds importance culturally and scientifically specifically as
        26:41
    Alaskans I think looking at Alaskan native science could share a lot of
        26:47
    hidden education within the elusive understanding of native elders while Western science is always evolving
        26:54
    Alaska native knowledge knowledge has been around for centuries and still holds true as an example subsistence or
        27:02
    substances like hooligan oil in Hudson Bay tea are just two types of medicines that have been used for hundreds of
        27:08
    years for therapeutic and healing purposes today are that being said I
        27:15
    strongly believe that Alaskan native knowledge should be encouraged within our curriculum and that the power of
        27:20
    Western science has shrouded our views of what we believe to be correct in comparison I quote likewise Euboea you
        27:29
    pick traditional knowledge reflects an understanding of the natural world based on a massive set of scientific
        27:36
    scientific experiments continuing over generations Co AG Lee n quill
        27:42
    we as Alaskans and more in particular as scientists need to put an end to the
        27:47
    thought Western science is above all and should start to embrace the idea that all now all knowledge is power
        27:56
    reflecting personally I myself am earning a bachelor's of liberal arts with an emphasis in environmental
        28:02
    science history and political science I believe that indigenous science holds
        28:08
    importance in our education system even though indigenous knowledge was not historically written down indigenous
        28:15
    knowledge is still pure and I quote is Science and invention of European
        28:22
    thought or have legitimate scientific bodies of knowledge in scientific ways of thinking emerged separately another
        28:29
    coal in quote continually a quote no you pick word exists for science when asked to
        28:36
    define science others define it as trying to know trying to understand trying to grasp the origin trying to
        28:44
    find the source the process of understanding a way to try to understand
        28:49
    through a process of elimination a process that is sight that the life
        28:55
    sorry excuse me a process is that sign science of life a process of seeing in
        29:03
    predicting the future and quote it seems as if Western science has became the
        29:09
    precursor for what is considered science and that any other way of doing science
        29:14
    just isn't so I disagree drawing from the indigenous worldview of you pick
        29:20
    culture I quote much of you picks scientific knowledge is manifested most
        29:25
    clearly in their technology one may argue that technology is not science however technology does not spring from
        29:32
    a boy continually you pickin inventions which include the kayak river fish traps
        29:40
    in a wide range and a wide range of hunting and fishing gear represent technique not technology that would not
        29:46
    have been developed without extensive scientific study a flow of currents and
        29:52
    rivers of the ebb and flow of tides and bays and the feeding cresting and
        29:57
    migratory habits of fish mammals and birds this is just a small portion of
        30:04
    the ways you pick people have derived their own way of science to help their better way to help better their way of
        30:10
    life however the listened errs might for migration patterns to put the
        30:15
    preservation of meats and berries to preparing clothing to extensive knowledge of navigation from traveling
        30:22
    on open seas to snow covered tundra the list goes on and on but the point that
        30:28
    is important to walk away with is that the fact that these practices have been around for thousands of years and have
        30:34
    followed the scientific method of trial and error
        30:39
    however environmental science is not the only kind of science that can benefit from indigenous inspirations in this day
        30:48
    and age political science can also be renewed in proximity to the indigenous values drawing from political itical
        30:57
    science portion of my degree I decided to look at indigenous groups as they are minorities in the United States as we
        31:06
    all know the United States is formed around this idea that we are a democratic republic however the catch is that in democracies
        31:14
    you get one vote per person well that means the majority rules while
        31:21
    indigenous groups are minorities it's important to understand that the political playing field is most certainly not level and indigenous
        31:30
    groups are not always represented equally consequently important pieces of
        31:36
    one's culture like indigenous sciences are overlooked and seen is not important however that doesn't need to be the case
        31:43
    we have students and teachers have a chance to incorporate more into our
        31:49
    curriculums and can embrace things like indigenous sciences in conclusion
        31:56
    indigenous science deserves the respect and acknowledgement of being just as real and as just as powerful as Western
        32:03
    science I believe that indigenous knowledge that if indigenous knowledge was taught and shared in our education
        32:09
    system it would open a lot of respect that is deserved within indigenous culture Western science has held the
        32:16
    power of prayer and privilege since the Enlightenment era however we all live in a new era and are trying to work on
        32:23
    sharing knowledge and power in the end this is not to say in any way Western
        32:29
    science is wrong it is merely meant to open our eyes as Alaskans and help promote the fact indigenous knowledge is
        32:36
    important as well thank you

    hi I'm ray Romberg I am a persistent college student this

        33:30
    the sentiment could just as well have been spoken fifty-one years later during the week of October 22nd 2018 when bombs

    were found in the mail of prominent Democratic American leaders when two african-american senior citizens were
        33:45
    gunned down in the parking lot of a grocery store in Kentucky and when eleven mostly elderly Jewish Americans
        33:52

    truer the world turned to hell in seconds in walk in what dr. Saul Neely
        34:53
    described as a quote spectacle of power white supremacy acted out in glaring deadly ways those 13 people named lost
        35:02
    their lives to white supremacy we will honor and remember them but what of the
        35:08
    millions unnamed who have over the centuries lost life liberty and the pursuit of happiness two systems of
        35:15
    oppression upon which this country was founded these recent violent acts of what dr.
        35:21
    Neely calls quote cultural monstrosity represent the icing on the cake of the white supremacy and cultural domination
        35:28
    which has characterized our nation for ages which is harmed and continues to harm millions of Americans how do we act
        35:35
    in the face of such violence how do we act in the face of such deeply entrenched inequities in times like
        35:43
    these how do we as individual citizens speak truth to power the writings of
        35:49
    Herbert Marcuse a-- and michel foucault offer insights into these questions why
        35:54
    Lyndon Genuity might offer an answer by examining the conditions for social
        36:00
    revolution as outlined by maracuja the concept of the parent easy ass tease or truth teller as enunciated by
        36:06
    Foucault and the complexities of indigenous worldviews we gain useful perspectives into our current day hell
        36:13
    and hope for a way out of it as Mark ooza goes on to say in the aforementioned quote we have we also
        36:21
    have the capacity to turn it the world into the opposite of hell but how with
        36:28
    the rise of hate crimes in America up 11.7% in 2017 according to FBI data it
        36:35
    would seem we were moving in the wrong direction with divisive rhetoric coming from our president with the unequal
        36:40
    distribution of wealth only increasing what is needed is not just changed but transformation indigenous ways of
        36:48
    knowing offer such a path forward according to Mark ooza we already have exactly what we need for this to occur
        36:54
    quote all the material and intellectual forces which could be put to work for the realization of a free society are at
        37:01
    hand but if these tools to create transformation are at hand why do we seem to be moving far
        37:07
    they're away from this free society Fuko points to the modern day structure of power and answering this question in
        37:13

        37:19
    modern powers capillary micro techniques Foucault sees power is decentralized and
        37:25
    depersonalized the diffusion of power through the quote capillaries of the social system alters the model of
        37:32
    political action there is no single privileged place for the political activists to go to work
        37:37
    no locus of power whose removal will bring the whole system tumbling down though no local struggle is necessarily
        37:44
    more crucial or more effective than any other the political agent must start with the local and the specific and you
        37:51

    supremacy manifests in our institutions of learning from science to linguistics to literature the domination of Western
        39:35
    ways of knowing perpetrate white supremacy within our universities according to Quigley quote Western
        39:41
    science has become the prototype for what counts the science today and other ways of thinking and doing science have
        39:48
    largely been discounted by the euro-american scientific and educational communities such a narrow view of

        40:01
    it simultaneously devalues those cultures which traditionally rely heavily on naturalistic observation and

    insight and quote it also prep perpetuates systems of power which do
        40:14
    harm to all of us in the face of bigotry which puts a premium on one right way of
        40:19
    being we can look to indigenous knowledge systems which according to Witt through stories quote permit us
        40:27
    some access to the perspectives of other beings often those very different from ourselves
        40:32
    this doesn't mean cutting out European ways of knowing but only decentering them quote if we want to learn how to

        40:45
    efficient ways to do just that learning from literature from stories quote the

    my name is Claire Helgeson I'm a senior in the Alaska Native Studies program here at UAS I'm from Seattle where I
        42:24
    earned my associates degree at Seattle Central Community College I'm very
        42:30
    grateful to be here and happy that my professors are in the audience and to them I'd like to say gunas xishi thew so
        42:38
    to thank you for teaching me it is an
        42:43
    academic fallacy to think that anything could stand still long enough for it to be truly studied or known as static in
        42:49

    that identify as dynamic and interconnected this movement enables change embracing indigenous studies and
        43:03
    its inherent movement can catalyze transformation in the institutions and communities it serves to embrace the and
        43:09
    movement we humanize each other as I can look at you all and say is Carroll Edelman warrior says of her art I am
        43:15
    under no illusion that they have permanence in their current form in her description of her process of
        43:21
    glassblowing she concludes that quote while the end product can be aesthetically pleasing such control also
        43:27
    feels like domination and the result is temporarily static rather than flexible when stressed the fixed form can shatter
        43:34
    and quote I like in this analogy as I believe warrior intended to our experience of higher education knowledge
        43:41
    is a thing we try to fix in our minds at the expense of our collective humanity our connections to each other and the
        43:47
    things we study are coming into ourselves is dominated by the process of Education when we
        43:52
    perceive our knowledge is fixed our thought world becomes shatter able youpix color and gaia cook oscar cut

    oscar Quigley in his book sharing our pathways wrote that quote native ways of
        44:04
    knowing imply action states of knowing that entail constant flux of doing the
        44:10
    universe and Mother Earth are constantly changing if we are looking at and trying to make sense of the world in which we
        44:15
    live you must speak of it as an active process this constant movement is a
        44:21
    natural phenomenon and is fundamental in indigenous cultures I've experienced this in the artistry of indigenous story
        44:27
    containing culture but not fixing it in publication as we try as we try to make
        44:33
    sense of the colonial world and Western culture through our indigenous studies lens it benefits us to accept the
        44:39
    movement of what is thought to be the past into the future the past becomes fluid and breaks free of the story arc
        44:45
    it can it is constructed as we often return to what is revealed at the admission of this movement which is that
        44:52
    the colonial past informed our present and flows through into forms and institutions that we experience as
        44:58
    pillars of society today these pillars such as white supremacy are demystified when we track their transformation from
        45:04
    their origin of european ships with white sails familiarizing ourselves with movement and transformation of ideology
        45:11

        46:22
    the reader as Charles says if it were agreed that you pick language and
        46:27
    culture could exist just on paper future generations of yupik youth and language learners would be limited to what is
        46:33
    filtered onto the page language is meant to be shared among people and exists in their hearts and culture is the movement
        46:40
    transcending semantic language that occurs in a group when as lost in translation is the movement of spirit
        46:46
    heart connection to each other in the land of origin and much more that we cannot conceive up when we come together
        46:52
    in indigenous studies with a shared goal of uplifting native cultures and languages we are no longer alone with
        46:58
    pages of words we engage as a group to prioritize connection to community the
        47:04
    late Carole Edelman warrior in her article indigenous collectives said that she offers prayers to slime molds a
        47:11
    life-form that defies Western binaries restricting life to either single or multi celled organisms they exist a
        47:19
    single-celled amoebas but when food is scarce quote they morph into a collective they work together as a
        47:25
    single body and close there is a constant quote rhythmic pulsing flow within the cell that allows it to form
        47:32
    quite a complex understanding of its environment this constant movement is what in deduced philosophers agree is
        47:38
    common among Native American cultures this is also a human characteristic that we might not recognize in ourselves as
        47:44
    Westerners the way we perceive our bodies as individuals is colored by fixed categories of our construction we
        47:52
    become more human when we recognize that we cannot observe movement movement if we are never static though we do not
        47:59
    know the extent to which we are connected we cannot claim that we are separate interdisciplinarity and ended
        48:05
    in indigenous studies allows us to see how the movement and transformation of slime molds are not bound to be linear
        48:12
    or exponential movement a trend of necessity and of care for each individual in the collective this
        48:18
    breaks binaries of individuality that we find ourselves bound to and reminds us
        48:24
    reminds us of how we can move as collectives returning our humanity and connecting us to each other
        48:29
    graciously slime molds can quote help us identify the discourses that concretize
        48:35
    and police such boundaries they can help us further the entire great interrogation into how why and where
        48:42
    such boundaries are placed and help us recognize whose interests they serve and quote with this as we begin to move
        48:50
    collectively we have to shift boundaries that separate us in our education as we become more human we strive for our
        48:57
    institutions to reflect us the little text in this burgeoning fields such as
        49:03
    the book critical indigenous studies has been published as recently as 2016 in
        49:10
    this book Daniel Heath justice of the Cherokee Nation asks in our education that we quote give up mastery for
        49:17
    modesty to find spaces where we do comprehend one another but also to be ok with a mystery between us and close for
        49:25
    a Western thinker this might incite a sure thought that without mastery we will be left with inadequacy we can
        49:31
    instead consider this shift of our value of individual excellence toward a value of understanding as quote understanding
        49:38
    the humanity understanding with humanity means recognizing the capacity of one another to love to laugh to fear and to
        49:45
    express all the joys and sorrows of our human existence rather than the quote
        49:51
    flattening out of these experiences in these differences this is what justice
        49:57
    calls for our education system to do this critique is that Western education attempts to flatten our experience
        50:03
    particularly the multi-dimensional movement of indigenous cultures into a package of all two dimensions there is
        50:09
    rarely a structure in our higher education to support human emotion and spirituality in indigenous studies we
        50:15
    strive to ensure cultural safety for each other cultural safety means that continuity of native languages and
        50:21
    cultures is not jeopardized in this way quote indigenous studies of the moral
        50:26
    imperative well as an intellectual intervention this moral imperative is to teach each
        50:32
    other is to each other as well as to history placing this in the context of
        50:37
    the land we're on and the people who come from here at you is historically denied realities of native peoples title
        50:44
    to land is taught which is direct action against current initiatives to bury this history this is movement of change in
        50:52
    knowing the history of the land under our feet we become obligated to it and to each other knowing ourselves relative
        50:59
    to this context we are no longer anonymous and we cannot possibly justify further scars to the earth
        51:06
    Graham King Amanullah Smith a maori scholar who guides us in indigenous
        51:13
    studies challenge us challenges us to quote engage in positive proactive initiatives
        51:18
    in the face of oppression and exploitation Smith reminds us that we must not spend time naming the
        51:24
    subordinate group and instead quote concentrate our limited energies and resources on what it is we want include
        51:31
    we need not solidify ourselves as the other within indigenous studies because every single time we put a name to the
        51:37
    to colonialism or speak native languages in school we shift towards equity in the institution we see the truth of colonial
        51:44
    atrocities clearer when we move from them in this way I have experienced Indigenous Studies as connecting healing
        51:51
    and uplifting we're in constant movement towards change on an undefined undefined
        51:56
    plain of dimensions imperceptible to us the movement is inward reaching far out
        52:03
    strengthening our communities Forsyth's call to action is that indigenous
        52:08
    peoples must join together in a strategic global resistance to protect our interests movement and change are
        52:16
    broad topics to write a paper on to define this change would be a fallacy to as warrior reminds us that quote all
        52:23
    things are not things so much as process or movement the movement and changes
        52:28
    that I'm interested in as I really all should be are social this became true to
        52:35
    me when a friend asked I don't get it what is the point of decolonization I responded that I believe it is to end
        52:40
    people immediate suffering people are still dying at the hands of the colonizer here I'm an outsider with minimal experience
        52:48
    speculating with hope for change in our education system to cease living out the legacy of colonialism in indigenous
        52:54
    studies I believe we aim to exist as quietly says in states of knowing that
        53:02
    entail constant flux of doing there will be inherent movement and change wherever Indigenous Studies exists space has to
        53:10
    be created in institutions for the movement and reclamation of our community as walky Charles I offer these
        53:17
    just as walkie Charles I offer these words as a collection of thoughts like fish caught in a net in a net and held
        53:23
    for just a moment some escaping and some unable to fit through the holes all
        53:41
    right well it's just about five o'clock here dinner is about to happen but is
        53:47
    there a quick comment or question yes a
        53:59
    date you yeah we have to us a good shot
        54:09
    I thought wash put your cover you today yeah yeah funky ass yeah loony you
        54:21
    yeah but you have to agree and I just
        54:28
    want to acknowledge your work and perceive your words not let them just
        54:35
    fall I think you guys are doing important work I heard a lot of names of
        54:41
    wonderful colleagues including the wife what am I really really good friends and
        54:48
    I just really want to acknowledge what you've done and what you said and
        54:54
    saw you doing a wonderful job I've heard that your students cry in your class because so much work for them to do I
        55:02
    think it's also because they're doing the important work that needs to be done to result in these deconstruction right
        55:15
    that you say those names and did not be acknowledged the Jewish names by the way
        55:22
    I just felt like in my culture when you say someone's name when they passed on here inviting them into the room so you
        55:29
    by acknowledging their names you invited them into this room and I just want to say that I acknowledge that and those
        55:37
    people that passed on them and my cultures we'd still be mourning we would
        55:43
    still be in that grieving process and I just thought when you when you mention
        55:50
    their names it was really heavy and almost felt like they were coming in here and to me culturally my beliefs
        55:56
    they were so I just want to acknowledge that because we always like you said
        56:02
    there's always a constant constant process it's a constant process well
        56:07
    something has always remained the same as healing some of us that do know that
        56:13
    healing but raising that healing and I speak of the healing I was I was I mean
        56:20
    I come to the school to try to learn how to write I don't come here to try to
        56:27
    learn about my people I don't try to come here to understand what it was like
        56:32
    100 years ago another 50 years ago I'll have to fight these battles right now I don't fight it
        56:39
    with a spear I fight it with a pen I find it I find it by going to vote so
        56:45
    these things you talk about we as indigenous people evolve we're here and
        56:51
    it's it's nice to hear a panel talk
        56:57
    about us who are us you know like we're here and we are causing rifts and
        57:03
    ripples in this tennis in this so I just want to acknowledge definitely
        57:11
    acknowledge those names crops as a fellow student you know I know how hard it is to go to school and then and then
        57:20
    to come to a symposium like this and just you know talk about what your
        57:25
    papers are about and and to to know that
        57:30
    we put so much into these papers like man I it's just so hard just to put
        57:37
    these feelings on paper and then like sometimes it just goes and only one person gets to read it and so it's nice
        57:45
    to hear your words and your feelings because this is what's gonna change this building right here and this is what's
        57:52
    going to change our perceptive perceptions on on both sides because it is gonna take unity I never once get
        57:59
    angry when I feel that my people are getting pushed down I don't get
        58:05
    defensive like I used to when I was a kid where I just let's go let's go oh
        58:10
    you want to fight let's fight I grew frightened now it's like I have to speak up and I have to say we're here
        58:18
    don't worry don't be sad whenever you feel the Trump's fit for me
        58:24
    personally the Dunleavy's you know the ones that want to put us in the schools the ones I want to take us away don't
        58:31
    worry about that we're here I'm here you're here let's be
        58:36
    proud let's unify it doesn't matter where you come from doesn't matter if

        58:48
    States of America and why are we in fear
        58:55
