      4:08
  sunrise and before i introduce tonight's moderator dr saul
      4:14
  neely i would like to take a moment to acknowledge the homelands on which many of us gather tonight
      4:20
  and to thank our sponsors our uas campuses reside on the unseated
      4:28
  territories of the aquan tantaquan and shiitake
      4:34
  on linget ani also known as juno ketchikan and sitka alaska
      4:40
  we acknowledge that lingat peoples have been stewards of the land on which we
      4:45
  work and reside since time immemorial and we are grateful for that stewardship
      4:51
  and incredible care we also recognize that our campuses are
      4:57
  adjacent to the ancestral home of the hadas and simsian and we commit
      5:02
  to serving their peoples with equity and care we recognize the series of unjust
      5:10
  actions that attempted to remove them from their land which includes forced
      5:15
  relocations and the burning of villages we honor the relationships that exist
      5:22
  between linga haida and simsian peoples and their sovereign relationships to
      5:29
  their lands to their languages their ancestors and future generations
      5:36
  we aspire to work toward healing and liberation recognizing our paths are intertwined in
      5:44
  the complex histories of colonization in alaska

      5:54
  from the past and these stories carry us as we weave a healthier world for future generations

  it's good to see you all here tonight uh as a citizen of the cherokee nation
      9:05
  who has lived in alaska for over 20 years with the last 11 of those years in
      9:10
  shinger ani on the land of aquan and taku kwan where my daughter was born and
      9:16
  enjoyed the nurturing support of many peoples especially from the indigenous community
      9:22
  it's an absolute pleasure to be here today to moderate and participate in tonight's event a most powerful song
      9:30
  elevating indigenous voices we convene this evening with a group of
      9:35
  incredible alaskan poets who not only enjoy the respect and admiration of the
      9:41
  multiple alaskan communities from which they hail but who also stay engaged in
      9:46
  those communities elevating indigenous voices in the interest of de-colonial justice and reparation
      9:54
  although i am currently residing in ellensburg washington and teaching at heritage university located on yak
      10:01
  mumami tichom the yakima nation reservation alaska
      10:06
  especially southeast alaska still very much feels like home to my family
      10:11
  so i'm grateful to jonas for the invitation to moderate and participate in tonight's event
      10:17
  both for the invitation and because i know how much work went into organizing it
      10:22
  and i'm going to say real quickly since the pandemic i've given a whole lot of talks by zoom and this is the
      10:27
  first one without a powerpoint presentation so i'm super happy about that i'm very excited to be here as part of
      10:34
  the panel of great talent but i'm also excited uh that we convene tonight as a celebration of joy harjo more generally
      10:42
  in her book in american sunrise more specifically which is the one campus one book selection this year
      10:50
  now in conversation with one another earlier this week the panel we identified a set of loosely
      10:57
  related themes beyond the influence of harjo's poetry on our own work that we
      11:02
  wanted to address this evening however directly or indirectly and we sort of settled on five uh
      11:08
  clusters of concerns poetic lineage or poetic ancestors
      11:15
  palm as sacred site increasing visibility of indigenous poetry culture history people
      11:23
  displacement as well as historical violence transgenerational trauma memory and the
      11:30
  possibility of repair and tonight we invite you to reflect on these themes or questions throughout the
      11:37
  evening as we hear from our talented poets and collectively meditate on how these themes intersect
      11:43
  diverge and break like waves over the spirited shores of our indigenous
      11:49
  futures now as moderator i'll briefly open these poetic meditations to say something very
      11:56
  briefly about why joy harjo's work is important to me which is for many reasons but i'll
      12:02
  rest on this i first studied harjo's poetry when i attended cornell school of criticism in
      12:08
  theory although i known other work i hadn't really studied it and i am not at all
      12:14
  allergic to that vocabulary of study in any way because for me to study
      12:20
  means holding a book in your hands and in this case it was how we became human
      12:25
  holding a book in your hands and listening to turn and turn the text with a kind of
      12:31
  ritual self-discipline to rub it until it bleeds as a rabbi once said
      12:37
  and what i've always loved about harjo's work is that while it stays grounded and
      12:42
  rooted and true to muskogee creek culture it also opens under the possibility of a
      12:49
  radical pan-tribal solidarity and this is actually an argument that craig womack makes who's also muskogee
      12:56
  creek and cherokee in his book red on red harjo embraces a kind of indigenous
      13:03
  cosmopolitanism and this feature of her work is what makes her the perfect poet laureate of
      13:09
  the united states and when we encounter harjo's poetry it
      13:14
  is as if we are at once called to bear witness to everything that's come before us the totality of
      13:22
  settler colonial violence and its innumerable victims while at the same time we are called to
      13:29
  secure our indigenous futures that's the calling of her poetry like in
      13:34
  grace where she writes i know there is something larger than the memory of a just dispossessed people
      13:40
  we have seen it there is the call to bear witness a calling that emerges from
      13:47
  and is discernible within proximity to the ineffable
      13:53
  like when she writes in dear dancer in this language there are no words for
      13:58
  how the real world collapses or in her poem protocol when she writes
      14:03
  i do not know your language though i hear the breaking of waves through the vowels
      14:09
  these are heavy words that nevertheless rise up out of the ineffable
      14:15
  the ineffable which might in the end be our most powerful song
      14:22
  so let me go ahead and introduce tonight's speakers earlier today by email i suggested that
      14:28
  we determine the order of tonight's poetic presentations based on geography moving north to south
      14:33
  i don't know why it just seemed like it seems like some kind of reverse colonial geography to me right like
      14:39
  instead of north to the future we're gonna we're gonna decolonize going from the north to the south
      14:45
  so we're going to start tonight with marie tozier who is coming to us from gnome
      14:52
  uh and marie teozer is an anubiac poet who earned an mfa from the low residency
      14:58

      16:23

      16:28
  him to realize a long time dream which is to write a feature film screenplay and clink it about how native boarding
      16:35

      17:40
  movements followed by a brief q a and our first movement each poet will read a bit from their own work while
      17:46
  speaking to some of the shared themes or concerns we identified earlier
      17:51
  in this way each poet will speak about 10 minutes which should last about half an hour
      17:56
  our second movement will be comprised of questions the poets will ask each other some of which have been prepared in
      18:02
  advance and some of which will be extemporaneous that should also last about half an hour
      18:08
  and our third movement each of us will read a poem by harjo that is dear to us and then we'll follow it up with some
      18:15
  questions from you all and wrap up the evening so it's a dynamic program
      18:21
  we won't delay anymore and with that will you please help me welcome to the zoom stage marie tozier
      18:30
  thank you saul um i just have very few introductory remarks um
      18:37
  i'd like to spend most of my time [Music] reading some poetry
      18:43
  um my book open the dark is mostly about sharing stories stories of family and
      18:51
  then um also of um
      18:57
  my anupiac culture i'm going to get started with my first poem entitled a quack rock
      19:05
  one spring sandhill cranes flew into sight having landed they became hard to spot
      19:13
  their bodies and wings dirt brown the color of dead willow leaves
      19:19
  that fall the crane wife fed her husband cranberries he balked
      19:25
  he made fun of the tiny morsel at night while he slept
      19:31
  she dressed his eyes in red berry pulp staining him for life
      19:42
  so one of the themes that saul touched on was um
      19:48
  making um making others visible or their
      19:54
  stories visible and one way that i like to think about that is um not only being a witness yourself but
      20:01
  sharing the witness of um [Music] others and for me that means sharing the
      20:07
  witness of um family members who have passed on and my next poem is a story um
      20:16
  that my grandfather used to share with us this one is called making do
      20:22
  grandfather watched in springtime as his older brothers gathered eggs
      20:29
  tethered to a handmade rope the eldest evans would make his way down
      20:35
  the rocky cliffs at deering he gathered turn eggs
      20:40
  large blue and speckled carefully placed in his sack
      20:46
  when he was done he'd tug at the rope my grandfather daniel
      20:53
  was not yet ready to climb the cliffs his footing unsure
      20:58
  instead he fashioned a long stick with a fabric pocket
      21:03
  reached down and swooped eggs from their nests
      21:13
  this next poem is is also another one for my grandfather
      21:20
  siblings my grandfather tells me stories of his only sister
      21:27
  elsie she died young giving birth to a third child
      21:33
  they were close he played the accordion and she the piano
      21:39
  but elsie could read music she played in the church
      21:44
  this makes grandfather love her more and in his way when he tells of her
      21:51
  death he never uses that word to him she began to disappear
      22:05
  so the the other sort of um
      22:10
  theme that i wanted to talk just a little bit about of um hard joe's is uh the idea of
      22:17
  writing about trauma or sharing trauma and um
      22:22
  i think that it's important as a writer to read what other
      22:28
  poets have written about trauma because it sort of in a way makes it okay for you to write about it
      22:35
  and so that when people are reading all of these
      22:40
  writers and poets um it makes it okay for them to talk about it which i think
      22:47
  you know when you're talking about things like um health care for indigenous people you
      22:53
  know if you're talking about the ihs hospital or if you're talking about topics like
      22:58
  suicide they're hard to talk about so i think that the more
      23:04
  that um we sort of put them out there
      23:10
  we we're giving people permission to talk about them and um
      23:17
  yeah okay here we go this this next poem is about
      23:22
  my mother confection all the health books say
      23:29
  sugar feeds the cancer my mother returned to me in a dream
      23:37
  her frail lace of lashes the sweet medicinal mother smell of her lip do her
      23:43
  smile i don't know if anyone will remember that she loved short ribs
      23:50
  salad with ginger sauce baklava baklava so decadent i refused to make it
      23:59
  while she lay in her bed unable to garner an appetite
      24:05
  i didn't bake it until her fight was gone the sweet no longer a temptation
      24:13
  like a child with a tiny treasure she bragged on her gooey honey smothered
      24:18
  pastry to millie her home nurse she stashed bits of delight away in the
      24:26
  freezer
      24:37
  and then sort of growing on um these topics
      24:43
  of sharing i have just a couple of poems um
      24:48
  that are what i guess we would call political poems they're making a political
      24:54
  statement and again i think the more that people write about them especially for indigenous people the more that we
      25:01
  write about them the easier it gets to share those topics which sometimes aren't that um popular to talk about
      25:08
  so this next one is called for the newly elected school board
      25:14
  member from anywhere but here welcome to the ancestral land of my
      25:21
  people we already know you bossy white woman thinks she owns the
      25:28
  world rules the school wags her finger in our face
      25:34
  preaches love if only we'd listen
      25:47
  okay and the last poem that i'm going to read is my longest poem in this book it's
      25:52
  called they tried to teach me history and
      25:58
  a few years ago i was invited to um a writing workshop
      26:03
  in anchorage that was held for indigenous poets and it was
      26:08
  the best writing workshop it was um there were a few alaska native poets
      26:14
  most of them were um native american poets from the lower 48
      26:20
  and uh it was just it was an amazing weekend because
      26:25
  sort of along the lines of um what i've shared with joy harjo's poetry
      26:31
  just being in a room with only indigenous writers
      26:36
  and feeling like there was this freedom to talk about things um
      26:44
  sort of helped this poem to come to come to be they tried to teach me
      26:49
  history the parents of these indian children are ignorant
      26:54
  and know nothing of the value of education john s ward u.s indian agent 1886
      27:05

      27:12

      27:37

      28:37

      30:11

      30:18

  thank you

  thank you marie
      31:11
  foreign
      31:40
  they sounded so good to my ears and thank you all for taking the time
      31:47
  to to listen uh it's a sacred thing for our people the act of listening to someone
      31:54
  and i'm so happy that uh you folks could join us and i'm very honored to be uh invited
      32:00
  here one of my first poetry teachers was diane glancy
      32:05
  and she was uh she was pretty hardcore she had really high expectations
      32:11
  and i felt like i was very productive under her teaching
      32:16
  and she was native american this was at the university of minnesota
      32:22
  in the early 1990s maybe the mid-1990s and and as i saw her
      32:28
  i thought well i think this is something i can do and of course the works of joy harjo
      32:35
  were were all over and so thinking about my path to writing
      32:42
  and producing and sharing poetry nora downhauer was a huge inspiration of
      32:48
  mine and i used to love to sit and listen to her read poetry and i would love to listen to her speechlingit
      32:55
  she also had high expectations of my thinking speaking and so that was
      33:01
  that helped me tremendously also ernestine hayes who i worked with
      33:07
  at the university of alaska southeast and as i was going into language teaching she kept saying don't forget to
      33:14
  write are you writing are you doing stuff and plenty of opportunities
      33:19
  provided by colleagues like princess johnson who invited me to apply and uh become a writer
      33:27
  for the molly of denali show i also did a workshop with sherwin bitsui i'll claim him as a teacher even
      33:34
  though it's one workshop because i think he's amazing uh so i'll just get into reading uh i'll
      33:40
  probably not say much in between each particular poem i'll just let them try and do the
      33:46
  talking i made a bad joke these are i don't have any powerpoint slides it's all just talking
      33:52
  so um i am one to ruin the event so i'll take credit for it
      33:59
  but one of the someone else who really put me on a path to continuing to write poetry is one of my
      34:06
  teachers and friends derek burleson i went to the university of alaska fairbanks kind of not knowing what i was
      34:13
  going to do with my life i'd been working for tribes for a while and i decided to go back to school so i
      34:20
  went to the university of alaska fairbanks i just met uh not too long before
      34:26
  uh mariah who would become we get married and and so we ventured
      34:31
  off to fairbanks and i said well i'll go see i'll talk to people linguistics and go talk to people in
      34:37
  english and nobody was home for linguistics and derek burleson was sitting in his office
      34:43
  and we had this amazing conversation i said i'm going to do that i'll go hang out with him
      34:48
  so this poem we traded poems years ago and this is one that i traded with him
      34:55
  it's called definition trickster for derek burleson
      35:01
  a man asked me today what is a trickster anyway what is raven
      35:07
  a god an angel a prophet i found trifle and tribune in a pocket
      35:15
  dictionary began humming the tune of a trail song brought back in a sack with beaver pelts
      35:21
  and moose meat drifted to a dream in which the caribou fell like wooden matches balanced
      35:27
  upright in high winds waited for their screams but in the eerie silence saw the want and waste in
      35:35
  the rotted meat calves milking dead mothers i long for a cup of coffee with my papa
      35:43
  raven turns upon itself the definition thickens like years old oil
      35:49
  black with use and littered with metallic flakes that tell of a coming breakdown of where and war and waste
      35:58
  the river is an odd mixture of silt and salt blood and bourbon
      36:03
  scars and laughter i drift to a dream where flames lick up
      36:08
  to the top of my favorite carvings the markers that show which land belongs to which clan
      36:15
  a young man shoots the top of his own clan marker his face is a riddle of pock marks where
      36:21
  we trade smallpox for influenza tuberculosis for meth ceremony for
      36:27
  distance standing amongst the raindrops that come
      36:32
  incessantly in sideways patterns i toil through the pages in hopes that the answer is there
      36:38
  why raven could release fresh water salmon day and moonlight and then
      36:43
  seemingly leave us to our own disastrous methods i let the small book fall into the river
      36:50
  it floats off like a canoe without a rudder a man without wisdom the echo of a shape that does not exist
      36:58
  is not carved from the soil and dripping with blood and suffering
      37:03
  the voice comes up from the river the voice comes up from the river
      37:09
  it is distant at first the sound of other footfalls while walking through a dense forest
      37:15
  a beaver pushing rocks off the shore definitions turn upon themselves to
      37:20
  reveal nothing but the paint-strip surface of an old carving one that has survived fires and floods
      37:28
  its children turning upon themselves and their people the man has been here long enough to
      37:34
  answer his own question beginning with a riddle of silence i look into his eyes and see my
      37:40
  distorted reflection this is stillness the river roars into my ear all the
      37:46
  things i could see the history of a people who have lost their way over and over again
      37:53
  it is a pattern i tell him one that comes from your mind imitation of imitation trying to mimic
      38:00
  the voice of the river pretending to be ourselves it is a man being eaten by cancer and
      38:07
  laughing and loving because his footprint is filled with joy and faith in the language of his paternal uncles
      38:14
  it is the hammer nose that carved a place for us where we are born in the lap of our paternal aunties
      38:21
  it is all of this and none of this and more it is the soft solitary call of a raven
      38:27
  who has lost her loved one and she will not stop looking it is the voice of
      38:32
  reason in a time of pestilence it is the voice of the spirit that left luggage
      38:37
  and dry fish bundles in a river that fills with sustenance year in and year out
      38:44
  it is never too late i tell him to start our own definition
      39:03
  the kingfisher is either looking at me or away between dusk and twilight the lions
      39:09
  soften and run together there is a knot in the tree where all my thoughts reside a shadow in aging
      39:16
  cottonwood beginning to freeze even as a pretend season gives way to the thaw
      39:23
  the cold is coming son the day when i let go of your hand
      39:29
  i never wanted to see you this way i never even thought about a time to release
      39:36
  she is walking with the ancient ones it was all i could say to my big brother over the phone in the night
      39:44
  it was all i could do reach out to all corners of the known world in one instance i am a child again
      39:50
  protected beneath a powerful wing the kingfisher is too far away
      39:57
  i think i know the shape but my eyes fail me at this distance
      40:02
  sometimes we know when we are alone even when surrounded by love and growth
      40:07
  the moments turn into themselves and eddie where the salmon used to gather i thought at one time i had the strength
      40:14
  i thought at one time i knew where to go my grandmother once dreamt of a hill
      40:21
  her two sons played happily but would not look her way her husband's parents were with them
      40:26
  looking back at her over the distance letting her know her time had not come
      40:34
  the kingfisher is gone when i look back but why do i feel like it is in my cupped hand
      40:44
  maybe i'll do i'll do two more
      40:51
  the old lady with all the money
      40:56
  this gallery is all dust and facade planted in a town where gold rush is the
      41:01
  center of humanity trapping us in a place of false beginnings
      41:07
  there was a world that wasn't coated in snow an old lady walks in and makes the
      41:12
  rounds she picks a mask up off the wall as if it were an insect
      41:18
  gritting rose of a percola a shade of bluish green that has taken a lifetime of practice to perfect
      41:26
  it's called warrior with a stroke but i don't tell her that the mask is made of alder dried out and
      41:33
  on its way to anciently familiar half its face wrinkled and sagging
      41:39
  pupils rolled up in a way that symbolizes visions of a world populated with spirit helpers
      41:44
  living dead we are all foreigners to the familiar
      41:50
  her face pulls down at the edges so much i picture a white rat perched on her hand scratching towards her face with
      41:58
  its pink eyes and pink tail it brings a plague of devices
      42:04
  my grandfather's grandparents are buried in the hills here this town is a row of buildings designed
      42:10
  to look old tenants hunger for the dollars of the same tourists who shop the same stores in the caribbean winter
      42:18
  a traveling world of illusions that has taken over the rush never quit
      42:24
  merciless in its consumption she finally asks why these masks are so
      42:29
  expensive i bought one just like this in the philippines for five dollars and you
      42:34
  expect me to pay a thousand here can you tell me why she asks oblivious
      42:41
  natives like money too i tell her and watch her walk out the door taking all
      42:46
  that she has somewhere else where stolen lies can shake hands over bones
      42:51
  forgotten
      43:07
  those little birds go full speed into their home raven named them landing through a hole
      43:14
  and i watched amazed that they have such precision you and i are just the right touch of
      43:20
  chaos emerging from battery and booze and drugs creating home for these babies who are
      43:26
  you me us and an ongoing man once talked about
      43:31
  watching seabirds they were a mass of thousands moving impossible fast and yet
      43:36
  never crashing into one another the image keeps surfacing in my mind of when i first saw you picking up luggage
      43:43
  at the juno airport maybe i watched longer than i should have but that was you
      43:50
  those birds he said are like a combined organism constant motion that relies
      43:55
  less on words and more on instinct watching them is meditation an impossible fast bird cloud
      44:03
  the life that scratches around us sometimes leaves new scars those hills and valleys where i wanted
      44:08
  to nuzzle into still call me with twists and turns that pushed me to oblivion
      44:15
  suddenly i am among the hemlock their citrus breaks the surface of my taste buds and the deepest parts of memory
      44:22
  become filled with opportunities to create memories without trauma
      44:27
  these birds and their nests i wonder about the worlds they maintain and how i told you that this is forever
      44:34
  and we rise and fall like love tides
      44:46
  i'm going to jump in real quick as is moderator and apologize for the technology glitch earlier i did want to
      44:51
  acknowledge the beauty of marie's words and then welcome to the zoomed stage my good friend cuone
      44:57
  but i could not unmute myself so i apologize marie it's important that your words are reciprocated
      45:03
  so i appreciate clonie for stepping in and doing that i'm going to cheese clone a for your words that always stoke
      45:09
  passion and inspire and what a way to end with a love poem
      45:16
  so let's uh welcome to the stage now uh vivian faith prescott so vivian
      45:25
  thank you i gotta follow these two great poets and friends too um
      45:31
  i'm reading to you from rangel kochkanak that's how we say this lovely
      45:37
  name and uh but i'm gonna take you about 3 000 miles right now
      45:44
  um to sop me and this is we're talking about poetic
      45:51
  lineage um this is probably in the shadow of the midnight sun contemporary
      45:58
  sami prose and poetry edited by harold gaske this is
      46:03
  probably one of the most well-known english language translations of
      46:09
  sami poetry and sami literature has its foundations
      46:14
  in old oral literature literary legacy maintained by skillful narrators and singers and that's a quote
      46:22
  from harold gaske and he says the oldest sammy poetry
      46:27
  consists then of yoik texts these texts include both short
      46:33
  love poems longer myths historical tales bits of poetry that describe people
      46:38
  places animals and fish and if you don't know what a yoik is i'd suggest you go to youtube after this
      46:45
  and find out but it's a sami uh traditional uh song chant and they're
      46:51
  usually either without lyrics or they have very short lyrics
      46:57
  and so the idea is this is the origin of uh poetry or our poetry
      47:06
  and some of the contemporary poets and older poets who have passed on paulus
      47:11
  utsi rani rani maga lucari sanovi pearson
      47:17
  sigborne skaden inger marie iko aryan anik nillis holmberg and
      47:24
  kirsty palto and you might know nils aslak
      47:30
  valkapa he's probably one of the most well known he's
      47:35
  since joined the ancestors but he has some similar things where you put
      47:41
  words and poems to music particularly jazz so that's uh
      47:46
  interesting um similar to joy harjo
      47:52
  and i was going to read you a very um short poem by paulus utzi
      48:00
  and it's called the yoik the yoik is a sanctuary for our thoughts
      48:07
  therefore it has few spoken words free sounds reach farther than words
      48:15
  the yoik lifts our spirit allows our thoughts to soar
      48:20
  above the little clouds has them as its friends
      48:25
  in nature's beauty and this is a translation from this book
      48:33
  and there are um probably the most too well-known uh
      48:38
  sami american poets writing right now my contemporaries are gary anderson who's a vietnam
      48:46
  veteran he's written this book sky fixer and he used this uh writing poetry in
      48:54
  order to heal and when we have one of our themes about settler colonial violence and
      49:01
  the transgenerational trauma gary has written these poems and he also has
      49:08
  some nice translations in the back his poems are written in
      49:15
  finnish sami swedish yeah northern sami finnish swedish and
      49:21
  norwegian so you'll get a really good dose of of his poetry in different
      49:28
  languages i'll read you one of his poems called it's a short fairly short one sky
      49:34
  fixer journal it's whisper time after daylight
      49:41
  before sunrise you meditate in silence listen for gaps in sound and thought
      49:50
  from this perch above camp creek canyon you imagine chief joseph's horses
      49:57
  women in blankets your eyes move along their route and you realize you are not the first to cry
      50:05
  here your drum speaks of images within images
      50:10
  journeys within journeys metaphor within metaphor
      50:16
  masks of ancient secrets raise your sami yoik
      50:21
  to the spirits of prairie of sunrise of guides and helpers
      50:27
  of earth water look what you have done welcome the seep
      50:33
  absorb artifacts of layered landscapes convergence of chronology not all answers yet evident
      50:42
  some found in a portal in a canyon just over the horizon
      50:49
  as the last echoes of drum beats rumble to the prairie your knees weaken breath labors
      50:56
  this journey's not over bright green sound moves through your
      51:01
  head music heard and seen not scales of your a minor childhood
      51:08
  no longing in these hopeful chords then birdsong
      51:14
  western meadowlark vesper sparrow
      51:19
  this is uh gary anderson and another contemporary whose
      51:26
  work if you can follow him on facebook he's really kind of hilarious and
      51:32
  also uh tragic sad fun funny his poetry is all over the place but it's really good and
      51:38
  he writes uh fiction too and i think he's a filmmaker
      51:43
  too and this ron reichi and his
      51:49
  title of his book is my ancestors are reindeer herders and i'm melting in extinction
      51:55
  so he has fiction nonfiction poetry in here and
      52:01
  the one i wanted to read you is called of his is called death and taxonomies
      52:08
  in class i mentioned my sami roots and strangely found anti-indigenous comments tarnishing
      52:15
  bones america's melting pot immigrant culture
      52:21
  how cultures are kept under glass under wraps underground as if buried
      52:28
  and a comedian on npr asked his racial mate makeup said
      52:34
  i don't want to answer that soon as you tell someone your ethnicity they start boxing you in
      52:40
  boxing as in punches thrown there is a cosmetology
      52:46
  to identity how to cover the bruises from all the domestic violence
      52:52
  my brother who works at a hazmat center says he watches the raccoons climb in
      52:58
  and out of the biohazard bins says he saw a deer glowing in the dark
      53:05
  i ask if he's kidding and he says there is nothing funny about america
      53:15
  yes i i love those also poetry and
      53:20
  gary anderson and i were recently poems translated by harold gaske and put
      53:27
  into sami's magazine it's a magazine over in
      53:34
  um sapmi that teaches the sami language so they
      53:40
  actually translated uh two of my poems and
      53:46
  uh two of i think one of one of gary's poems so that's really cool to have my
      53:53
  my poems translated and this one is one of my poems the translated one and
      54:01
  i'm not going to read it in sami because i'm just learning i'll read it in english although it does have a sami
      54:07
  title a word for snow and it's called bel gamas
      54:14
  half frozen to my ancestors who migrated from a migratory life
      54:20
  and to those who stayed that first meeting of our faint tracks
      54:26
  you called me out from the line drawn in water leaving wind pressing earth
      54:33
  keeping it close to the deepest lake my presence reminded you that you could
      54:39
  have been more like us an unfurled breath a soul's flight of
      54:44
  spirit but no you went packing took your children pulling the whole of
      54:51
  life into a strange form that day also brought you a village
      54:57
  beneath a pocket of sky but it slipped into the lake before your
      55:02
  eyes and you wondered if your mind was tricking you until the wind gave you instructions
      55:09
  stay back and dream of our singing
      55:15
  i noticed reading joy harjo's book rereading it that she has about
      55:22
  at least 25 poems or references of singing and and uses that as a theme
      55:27
  throughout the whole thing so that's kind of why i chose chose my heritage and joyc
      55:34
  and the idea of songs rhythms things like that
      55:39
  and this poem was also translated and it's called uh survival skills
      55:46
  if you wander through mid-summer believing in spirits grown old
      55:51
  the summer fog smoothing the sea raven dipping his wings hinting at
      55:57
  ancient cracks in the world perhaps you can silence this longing
      56:03
  this chanting of hollows shift this stretching light perhaps you can walk to my door and take
      56:11
  me with you there is a crust on the snow not strong enough for caring humans
      56:21
  so i have a poetry collection coming out from university of alaska press and it deals with the
      56:28
  basically the sami american diaspora many of the issues that we have
      56:33
  searching for our family back in satomi and reconnecting with our language and the
      56:40
  doji the crafts and even the poets and
      56:47
  being activism from over here how we deal with that
      56:53
  um because there's a lot of similar issues mining
      56:59
  trains going through the reindeer herding area
      57:04
  windmills things like that and so we try to work the sami american groups here
      57:11
  to help people over there but this poem here is called it's a prose poem it's called
      57:18
  unleash we could call up a gale and gust and breeze and storm
      57:25
  we are children of the sun yet rule the wind a fibrillation of current unwound
      57:32
  we use old songs to claw down trees and pluck gulls from the sky
      57:37
  our songs were once a secret handwritten on drum mats dancing in the
      57:43
  half-light of the moon now i use the old songs to soothe bees
      57:48
  to call a soft snowfall for calling up the wind from a scarlet evening sky
      57:55
  for pleas of sailor and sea we were once shunned and yes hung and
      58:01
  stoned even burned the rope in our hands an ancient method
      58:07
  to sing up the wind untying one knot then two
      58:12
  then three for singing they murdered us for singing
      58:19
  and this is a basically a poem about a drum that was one of the last
      58:26
  witch trials and the drum was confiscated the noah d
      58:31
  shaman was hung or murdered
      58:37
  and they have the drum is in a museum a dutch museum i believe and
      58:44
  recently the sami have been working to get it back
      58:49
  and so stay tuned for that because they may get it repatriated this very sacred drum
      58:57
  so that's about all i have and you know this uh contemporary poetry uh sami american
      59:04
  it's it's even though there's only a few of us uh is also sami so we're gonna add his book
      59:13
  to our growing list now so thank you
      59:20
  viviane that was fantastic and thank you for taking that opportunity to elevate indigenous
      59:26
  voices um that was such a delight
      59:31
  and we're gonna start to transition here into the next part in which uh each of
      59:36
  our poets will ask a question of another poet and we had
      59:42
  uh sort of set this up where marie would ask lance a question lance would ask vivian a
      59:47
  question and vivian would ask uh maria a question um so so we'll get
      59:53
  we'll get right into that uh but man i just i just gotta say you all i'm sitting here i'm looking at the
      59:59
  participant list and it's ah i miss the community of southeast alaska so much
      1:00:05
  it's so good to be here even though it's by zoom with all of you so this is fantastic
      1:00:13
  uh marie um would you like to start us off or how
      1:00:20
  are you feeling there sure i'm i'm okay thank you to lance and vivian um
      1:00:26
  it's really nice to hear your poetry my question for lance is
      1:00:34
  when you write do you find yourself writing for your people
      1:00:40
  or a general audience who do you write for
      1:00:45
  oh that's a great question uh i think it kind of depends uh sometimes when a poem
      1:00:53
  arrives uh it's just sort of me just sort of looking at a moment and
      1:00:58
  sometimes i'm not thinking about who it might be addressing there certainly are times where i think
      1:01:06
  uh it does address particular folks like i've written what i would consider shame
      1:01:11
  pull poetry where i try and blast some folks who i think are doing stuff like racist stuff and you know
      1:01:18
  things that i have to deal with and writing is one of my ways to to deal with that but then also
      1:01:24
  sometimes i'm thinking about our people or i'll write poems to my children and those ones have a different
      1:01:32
  sort of intimacy as i sort of think about what kinds of things would i want them to
      1:01:37
  to be able to hold on to and then um in 2014
      1:01:44
  my father was alive my mother was alive my stepmother was was alive and one of my younger brothers was alive and
      1:01:50
  they're all gone now and so over the past uh several years i've written a lot of
      1:01:57
  poems to them as a way to sort of deal with grief because because
      1:02:02
  sometimes your losses in life stack up like all in a row and and i really
      1:02:09
  was lost and i have a lot of people who helped me and a lot of people who
      1:02:14
  who saw me and and who um reached out and who were very kind
      1:02:19
  a lot of those in the language community a lot of students but the writing has always connected me
      1:02:26
  to sort of a place where i can also deal with some emotions i can
      1:02:31
  let go of because i think well i don't know how to deal with this thing and i don't want to carry it all over the
      1:02:37
  place so i'll just put it out there and so sometimes they have particular audiences in mind
      1:02:43
  um and other times they don't and sometimes i write kind of joke poems like i don't know if they're really joke
      1:02:49
  poems but it's sort of like that that lady who came in and asked about the mask like that was a real
      1:02:55
  thing and that was my actual response to her and she just turned around walked out the door when i said natives like
      1:03:00
  money too and so sometimes i want to just sort of capture that moment i was like how could i capture that moment because
      1:03:07
  it was funny but i was also i was mad and that was like the beginning of my exit from the tourist industry
      1:03:13
  [Music] i still haven't composed one where there was another guy who had this we we have these things that sometimes
      1:03:20
  we'd use to to take people out and we had one of those type of instruments there
      1:03:26
  and it was um he's like is this for like opening up clam shells or something and
      1:03:31
  i was like that's for busting skulls and then he just put it down after they thought i got to get out of this industry so um
      1:03:38
  yeah thanks for asking that's uh it depends but then there's some too
      1:03:44
  that uh that'll address it right to them in in the poem itself like derek he was uh
      1:03:51
  he was live when when i wrote that poem and so derek burleson when we traded those poems it was still dedicated to
      1:03:57
  him and for that one i wrote it for him and uh it was fun because he had this list of words that we weren't supposed to use i
      1:04:03
  think i'd probably use four or five of them in that poem so i was like ha ha take that teacher so
      1:04:09
  thank you for asking uh let's see so i will ask
      1:04:15
  vivian a question [Music] and i i really loved hearing poems of
      1:04:21
  our people that's through my my mother's my father's mother
      1:04:27
  the sami sai and he was he's made a lot of he made a lot
      1:04:32
  of reconnections in his life and i look forward to making those reconnections as well so my question for
      1:04:38
  you vivian is a poet is often surrounded by the voices of other poets
      1:04:45
  in what ways do they inform your work
      1:04:51
  well huge it's my earlier influences um joy harjo beth
      1:04:58
  brandt uh sister goodwin mary tall mountain polygon allen allison hedgecock some
      1:05:06
  people i've made friends with on facebook and i think ah i'm friends with allison hedge goku that's so cool
      1:05:13
  but what i do is i read a lot of poetry and i sit with it for a while and a book
      1:05:20
  can take me months to read one person's book i'm i'm rereading marie's for
      1:05:27
  example again and it took me a long time to read that collection because i read one poll maybe
      1:05:35
  a day maybe two poems and what they do is
      1:05:41
  make me braver i guess sometimes i'll read a poem and think wow i have a similar experience but i
      1:05:48
  didn't know i could say it i didn't know i could do that
      1:05:54
  and so i think that's mostly what they do and and then i'll come across a poet who's
      1:06:00
  maybe writing a certain form and i'm thinking about form and i might say wow i want to try that because we
      1:06:07
  all borrow from one another and i try not to take someone's like
      1:06:15
  specific style or voice and make it my own kind of thing even though we build
      1:06:20
  on those kind of things as writers and poets we do until we find our own way of of
      1:06:26
  speaking or saying things and in looking at the sami
      1:06:32
  poets in particular sami american poets um i noticed some similarities and
      1:06:38
  themes and the things we're trying to discover and say and so we do tend to
      1:06:43
  have a similar i don't know if it's voice or language in some of these poems
      1:06:51
  but i think subject matter form and mostly
      1:06:56
  like i think marie was saying you read other poets and and you think wow it's okay to say that
      1:07:04
  it's okay to be brave and and some people do use your poems to open up
      1:07:11
  um topics and talk about things and that's really an honor when someone does that so
      1:07:18
  anyway that's my answer
      1:07:24
  great thank you viviane and um do you want to share your question then with
      1:07:30
  marie well i'm fascinated by fiber artists i
      1:07:36
  think because uh my sister's a fiber artist but so when i found out marie
      1:07:43
  uh is a fiber artist which she works in meeting of sewing um
      1:07:48
  skin sewing knitting and you can see in the picture she's got sewing sewing
      1:07:54
  machines beside her i just love that it fits my question because
      1:07:59
  i like multi-disciplinary artists like kunai and
      1:08:04
  turns out marie too so i'm very interested in how
      1:08:10
  they work their art into their craft of poetry but for marie
      1:08:17
  you're a fiber fabric artist working in the mediums of sewing and knitting among others what skills
      1:08:23
  from that sewing and knitting art practice do you use to write poetry
      1:08:31
  yeah so um thinking about your question uh
      1:08:39
  the first thing is um i have written a couple of poems about sewing or about
      1:08:45
  knitting and um i want to say the first time that i
      1:08:52
  tried to write a poem about knitting my um professor at the time
      1:08:59
  didn't i didn't like that i was spending my free time you know doing anything but
      1:09:05
  reading or writing about poetry but for me um i really believe that when
      1:09:12
  you um [Music] when you get stuck in your writing if you turn your brain to something um
      1:09:20
  monotonous like knitting that you can do you know without thinking about it you
      1:09:25
  give your brain space to work out whatever issues um you have in your
      1:09:30
  writing so i think that's um
      1:09:36
  like the the biggest thing for me is um
      1:09:42
  knowing that if i take the time to play with you know with fiber with knitting
      1:09:47
  or um uh the thing that i've been doing a lot lately is working with kibbute which is
      1:09:52
  musk ox fiber musk ox yarn um is that
      1:09:58
  i it's it will eventually help me with my writing um and then the other thing
      1:10:03
  is i wrote a piece once that had to do um
      1:10:09
  i don't think i it might have been about sewing but what i did was i followed like
      1:10:16
  the um the steps that you would take in sewing so cutting out a pattern you know sewing
      1:10:23
  sewing it together and then hemming and it just it it just gave me this space to
      1:10:30
  write what i was wanting to write about but it gave me a um
      1:10:36
  it's like when you start to write a story or something and you don't really know how you're going to get from the
      1:10:41
  beginning to the end but you keep giving yourself these little um trail markers
      1:10:46
  and you just you know you don't know what the end looks like but you know what the next step looks like and that's what i think
      1:10:53
  that piece did for me was it showed me that i that i could write a longer piece
      1:10:58
  um and just write it without a set plan
      1:11:03
  i don't know if that was a good answer or not that's my answer
      1:11:09
  thanks viviane that's great
      1:11:15
  uh this is this is great this is fantastic um good stuff i wish we could stay here all night um
      1:11:22
  but uh it's just i don't know it's such a joy we're about to move into the the last part here our third movement before
      1:11:29
  q a uh but man when you are in the presence of indigenous poets and multidisciplinary artists as vivian says
      1:11:36
  you can start to feel secure in our indigenous futures and so
      1:11:42
  i think uh to echo our harjo keynote as we move
      1:11:47
  into our third movement here will each share harjo poem important to us uh before we go into the q a and maybe
      1:11:54
  we can just follow the rhythm or the cadence that we've developed so far uh and i'll go first and then we'll
      1:12:01
  follow with marie and then a and then vivian um
      1:12:06
  so yeah so i will i will get into
      1:12:12
  to this i'm the poem i'm going to read does come from hard joe's american sunrise
      1:12:19
  and uh this book was published in mid-august 2019
      1:12:24
  i literally received this book that week it was published it was the
      1:12:29
  week that i returned from the trail of tears trip with my father and my daughter and i read this poem how to write a poem
      1:12:37
  in a time of war and uh you'll hear at the end of the poem why it came to mean so much to me
      1:12:45
  how to write a poem in a time of war you can't begin just anywhere
      1:12:51
  it's a wreck shrapnel in the eye of a house a row of houses
      1:12:57
  there's a rat scrambling from light with fleshy trash in its mouth
      1:13:02
  a baby strapped to its mother's back cut loose soldiers crawl the city the river the
      1:13:09
  town the village the bedroom our kitchen they eat everything or burn it
      1:13:16
  they kill but they cannot take they rape but they cannot kill they take
      1:13:23
  rumors fall like rain like bombs like mother and father tears
      1:13:30
  swallowed for restless peace like sunset slanting toward a moonless
      1:13:36
  midnight like a train blown free of its destination like a seed fallen where
      1:13:42
  there is no chance of trees or any place for birds to live
      1:13:47
  no start here deer pier from the edge of the woods
      1:13:53
  we used to see woodpeckers the size of the sun and were greeted by chickadees with their good morning songs
      1:14:01
  we started to creek outside slippery with dew and laughter ah these smoky sweet sunrises
      1:14:09
  we tried to pretend war wasn't going to happen though they began building their houses
      1:14:15
  all around us and demanding more they started teaching our children their
      1:14:20
  god's story a story in which we'd always be slaves no
      1:14:26
  not here you can't begin here this is memory shredded
      1:14:32
  because it's impossible to hold with words these memories were left here with the
      1:14:37
  trees the torn pocket of your daughter's hand-sewn dress the sash the lace
      1:14:43
  the baby's delicately beaded moccasin still connected to the foot a young man's note of a promise to his
      1:14:51
  beloved no this is not the best place to begin
      1:14:57
  everyone was asleep despite the distant bombs terror had become the familiar stranger our beloved twin girls curled
      1:15:05
  up in their nightgowns next to their father and me if we begin here
      1:15:10
  none of us will make it to the end of the poem
      1:15:15
  someone has to make it out alive saying a grandfather to his grandson his granddaughter as he blew his most
      1:15:23
  powerful song into the hearts of the children there it would be hidden from the soldiers
      1:15:29
  who would take them miles rivers mountains from the naval court place of the origin story
      1:15:35
  he knew one day far day the grandchildren would return generations later
      1:15:42
  over slick highways constructed over old trails through walls of laws meant to hamper or destroy over stones bearing
      1:15:49
  libraries of the winds he sang us back to our home place from which we were
      1:15:56
  stolen in these smoky green hills yes begin here
      1:16:04
  all right
      1:16:10
  okay okay thank you saul thank you i am going to read um
      1:16:16
  white bear and it's from joy harjo's book she had some horses
      1:16:25
  white bear she begins to board the flight to albuquerque
      1:16:31
  late night but stops in the corrugated tunnel a space between leaving and staying
      1:16:39
  where the night sky catches her whole life she has felt like a woman
      1:16:45
  balancing on a wooden nickel heart approaching herself from here to there
      1:16:52
  tulsa or new york with knives or cornmeal the last flight someone talked about how
      1:17:00
  coming from seattle the pilot flew a circle over mount saint helens
      1:17:05
  she sat quiet but had seen the eruption as the earth beginning to come apart
      1:17:12
  as in birth out of violence she watches the yellow lights of towns
      1:17:19
  below the airplane flicker fade and fall backwards somewhere she dreamed there is the white
      1:17:27
  bear moving down from the north motioning her paws like a long arctic
      1:17:33
  night that kind of circle and the whole world
      1:17:38
  balanced in between carved of ebony and ice oh so hard
      1:17:45
  the clear black knights like her daughter's eyes and the white bare moon
      1:17:51
  cuffed like an ivory rocking cradle tipping back it could go either way
      1:17:59
  all darkness is open to all light
      1:18:05
  thank you honey sheesh uh so i wrote a short
      1:18:14
  dedication so maybe a a short poem for a wonderful poem
      1:18:21
  for shikatsuka indigenous peoples keep fighting
      1:18:27
  the good fight not each other for allies keep listening
      1:18:33
  so you will hear what to do not from within but with
      1:18:39
  for academia which i love am grateful for and also want to burn down
      1:18:46
  all these things can be true and for supremacists who should know it's time to
      1:18:52
  go this poem was called the fight
      1:18:58
  the rising sun paints the feet of nightcrawling enemies and they scatter into the burning hills
      1:19:06
  i have fought each of them i know them by name
      1:19:11
  from before i could speak i've used every weapon
      1:19:17
  to make them retreat yet they return every night if i don't
      1:19:23
  keep guard they elbow through openings in faith tear the premise of trust
      1:19:30
  and stick their shields through the doubt of smoke to challenge me
      1:19:37
  i grow tired of the heartache of every small and large war
      1:19:42
  passed from generation to generation but it is not in me to give up
      1:19:50
  i was taught to give honor to the house of the warriors which cannot exist without the house
      1:19:58
  of the peacemakers
      1:20:06
  vivian your turn
      1:20:12
  i picked a poem from an american sunrise page 53 if anybody has the book
      1:20:21
  it's called singing everything once there were songs for everything
      1:20:28
  songs for planting for growing for harvesting
      1:20:33
  for eating getting drunk falling asleep for sunrise birth
      1:20:40
  mind break and war for death those are the heaviest songs
      1:20:46
  and they have to be pride from the earth with shovels of grief
      1:20:52
  now we all hear our falling in love songs and falling apart after falling in love
      1:20:59
  songs the earth is leaning sideways and a song is emerging from the floods
      1:21:06
  and fires urgent tendrils lift toward the sun
      1:21:12
  you must be friends with silence to hear
      1:21:17
  the songs of the guardians of silence are the most
      1:21:22
  powerful they are the most rare
      1:21:28
  it's incredible vivian thank you so much for sharing that poem because that's the keynote i
      1:21:34
  struck at the beginning that maybe the ineffable is our most powerful song
      1:21:40
  brilliant brilliant we came full circle and we didn't even plan it let's uh let's move into the q a now um
      1:21:47
  thank you for all of our brilliant poets thank you to the community who showed up
      1:21:53
  um we did get a our first question comes from sabrina croft
      1:22:00
  and i'll just read it here have the panelists or poets ever encountered resistance or
      1:22:07
  censorship towards the ideas expressed in their poetry if so from whom and how did you respond
      1:22:15
  to it
      1:22:26
  i'll answer that uh yeah i've i think uh
      1:22:32
  ran into the same thing where he mentioned when a mentor said don't write about
      1:22:38
  this so or don't use these words so then you do so
      1:22:43
  that's that's what i one of my favorite poems that i've ever written that's been
      1:22:49
  pretty widely accepted it was because actually derek burleson was my mentor
      1:22:55
  too in the mfa but he had said grandmothers are cliche
      1:23:00
  and don't write about them so i wrote grandmother's art cliche and wrote about
      1:23:05
  them so when someone tells tells you not to write about something or it's or tries to censor you or you
      1:23:12
  submit a poem and the poem is rejected because of the subject matter you use a
      1:23:18
  word whatever it is then just send it somewhere else but yeah it goes on
      1:23:27
  um when it comes to poetry i don't i don't think so i i've been in workshops before
      1:23:33
  where there was sometimes a bit of an uncomfortable reception to some of the things that i
      1:23:38
  would talk about like if the concept of whiteness and and white superiority if those enter into
      1:23:46
  the the poem uh but at the university of minnesota i was
      1:23:51
  really inspired by this book called stabilizing indigenous languages that i happened to stumble upon because
      1:23:57
  somebody happened to be driving by with a big box of them and dropped them at our
      1:24:03
  american indian student center there and so i wrote a paper called stabilizing indigenous languages and i
      1:24:09
  turned it in this was for an upper level english class and i got the paper back and i got a c
      1:24:15
  minus on the paper and there was no comments on it it just said on the front page why doesn't
      1:24:22
  everybody speak english and so for me that was an act of institutional racism
      1:24:29
  and so i took it to the uh it was a grad student who was grading the papers in the class
      1:24:36
  so i took it to the teacher i took it to the dean i took it to the head of the english department and got the grade changed but beyond
      1:24:42
  that uh was inspired by that to really
      1:24:48
  fight for our languages and to try and make some systemic changes and uh
      1:24:54
  yeah i would i don't invite censorship or attempts to silence me but
      1:24:59
  uh i'll certainly write poems about that if it happens
      1:25:05
  for myself i don't i can't think of a time that i was censored uh
      1:25:11
  for any of the poetry that i've written i think
      1:25:17
  for me it was um like almost self-sent censorship because
      1:25:23
  um my experience was that um
      1:25:29
  you know you can write those poems that are hard to write but you don't want to give them to
      1:25:34
  anybody like you're afraid what they're going to tell you about them and so my goal for the last couple of years has
      1:25:42
  been to be um like an old native woman and the first poem that i read tonight
      1:25:48
  it's called a quack truck and that's what it means it means old woman um and i was going to say something
      1:25:55
  about lance's poem because he had a poem about an old woman but his wasn't as nice as mine
      1:26:01
  but my grandmother in her old age lost any sort of um
      1:26:08
  self censorship that that she ever had she was a
      1:26:13
  a christian woman but she got to the point when she was older where you could walk into her
      1:26:19
  house and you you knew that she loved you but she would look at you and tell you things
      1:26:25
  like man you got fat
      1:26:31
  you know i could never say that to anyone but the older i get it's like okay yeah i think i can say that to
      1:26:37
  someone thanks
      1:26:42
  awesome self-censorship indeed we did have a question earlier uh vivian
      1:26:49
  nancy lord was asking about the the if you could name the second sami poet that you read from
      1:26:59
  um were you gary anderson was one
      1:27:05
  and ron reichi r-i-e-k-k-i
      1:27:10
  is the other one and then i read from paulus utse from
      1:27:16
  the in the shadow of midnight sun so i'm not sure which one nancy you're referring to
      1:27:22
  but thank you viviane yeah ron reinke but i
      1:27:27
  wasn't sure how to spell his name yeah he's a filmmaker too and i think you would you would really like
      1:27:34
  his sense of humor
      1:27:40
  can can you spell his name or type in r-i-e-k-k-i i think that's how he spells it
      1:27:52
  and this book he has is from apprentice house press
      1:27:59
  and it's a mixture of prose and poetry
      1:28:06
  thank you very much
      1:28:11
  okay let's see i just received another question um [Music]
      1:28:17
  if you are new to reading and listening to poetry who do you recommend
      1:28:28
  i hope i got that question right
      1:28:48
  you know i i'll out yeah harjo of course uh i see vivian holding up harjo um
      1:28:54
  and and you know though the the poem that vivian read um
      1:29:02
  from uh in american sunrise singing everything it actually reminds me of a line
      1:29:08
  that poem reminds me of a line from simon ortiz uh his book of poetry from sand creek and he talks about
      1:29:16
  you should have seen the fool's singing summoning eternity right i love that
      1:29:21
  line and uh ortiz uh from sand creek in
      1:29:26
  particular that's uh one of my favorite books of poetry to teach it's one of my two favorite books of poetry ever
      1:29:33
  um and i love to teach that one it's really haunted it's a it's a it's a
      1:29:38
  haunted haunted book of poetry i don't know if our poets have other
      1:29:45
  suggestions yeah i think if you know your friend whoever or someone you're going to give
      1:29:51
  poetry to to introduce them to it you got to know a little bit about maybe
      1:29:58
  their personality what they might like or not like because there are differences
      1:30:04
  but i think joy harjo is a good one to start with because she she's a musician so her her stuff has musicality to it
      1:30:13
  and usually people who don't if you're not experienced with poetry you most likely
      1:30:21
  have no songs and you're singing with the radio and things like that so you
      1:30:26
  can start off with a poet that's um visually her stuff looks similar to songs too and she
      1:30:34
  doesn't have a lot of flowery words but the way she puts them together
      1:30:42
  it's really powerful so i think her stuff would be appropriate for someone who's
      1:30:48
  who's just getting into poetry
      1:30:55
  that's great renee were you gonna say something
      1:31:00
  yeah i was going to second simon ortiz uh sherwin batsui norah downhauer
      1:31:06
  richard dowenhauer um but like poetry is so incredible and i
      1:31:13
  really like what vivian said where you really take time to digest it and then
      1:31:19
  there's poetry all over the world and then there's there's poets and then there's moments and
      1:31:25
  and to really explore like what is going on and what can someone do in a
      1:31:30
  relatively short space you know and so that with the word
      1:31:36
  uh every word is going to count so much and every word counts always in writing but
      1:31:42
  with poetry it's going to be of just a moment you know like i remember uh one time i saw nora downhill or read
      1:31:50
  and she said um she said this poem is called genocide and i was like oh so i kind of buckled
      1:31:56
  my belt right like here it comes like this is gonna be the thing and she said
      1:32:02
  uh and i'll paraphrase because i don't have it in front of me but she's do you have it
      1:32:10
  okay i think saul is gonna pull up the poem and maybe he'll read it for us but i i think it's so fun because you
      1:32:16
  can be so surprised um and so this one like so you could see it on the screen
      1:32:23
  and this is nora mark's downhour and so she's she's giving a reading in fairbanks and then um
      1:32:30
  it happens so fast because it's got this big title right and then she says
      1:32:36
  picketing the eskimo whaling commission an overfed english girl stands with a
      1:32:42
  sign let the whales live and
      1:32:48
  fell out of my chair you know and you know what clooney when i teach this poem when i teach this poem this is how i do
      1:32:54
  it i render the ink white
      1:33:00
  and then i read the poem and then i deliver the title
      1:33:06
  and that's usually this moment where but it's not working do you and that's when the that's when the
      1:33:13
  students just freak out i'm so glad you brought that up
      1:33:24
  so i had a student at uas i had a student at uas this poem changed uh her
      1:33:29
  life she took one of my classes and we read this poem in class and at the end of the semester she said i don't want to
      1:33:35
  be that girl it was amazing
      1:33:42
  fabulous i think another
      1:33:47
  oh go ahead go ahead sorry sorry just gonna say really quickly um two poets that i really enjoyed because they sort
      1:33:54
  of taught me something about writing poetry were um jane hirschfield i know not indigenous that's okay and denise
      1:34:01
  levertoff just um for the way that their poetry sort of um
      1:34:09
  like in one little poem comes full circle with the title to the last line and i
      1:34:15
  think can teach you something about writing your own poetry
      1:34:24
  it's a great question um and i we probably have time for one more jonas is that
      1:34:30
  what do you think in there jonas
      1:34:38
  maybe while we're waiting for the response um another thought that i had was
      1:34:44
  to to read some poems and then to listen to the poet i know a couple that i think are really
      1:34:50
  pretty wonderful uh is we real cool like gwendolyn brooks
      1:34:56
  uh because when you read it like you have and i i would like to i usually i would have students read i was like read it
      1:35:02
  out loud how do you think it sounds you know and then i would have her then we would watch a recording of her reading it and
      1:35:09
  it's it's really amazing the way that she reads it and then i would have an interesting experience
      1:35:14
  as well with uh reading the poetry of langston hughes and then when i listened to to him i was like
      1:35:20
  oh wow that doesn't i i pictured it totally different in my mind and so i think it's fun too because
      1:35:27
  a poem it it's really interesting because it lives on a page but also lives in this moment
      1:35:34
  coming back norak she called it song
      1:35:39
  song language you know and it's really fun because sometimes when you're in that moment and you're
      1:35:45
  hearing the poet read it it's so much different than when you read it by yourself but then
      1:35:50
  there's also there's this agreement or sometimes a disagreement between those two
      1:36:00
  excellent and i saw i was muted there but um i think laura best was just asking
      1:36:07
  marie the second poet you mentioned was was that denise lovertoff
      1:36:14
  yes it was yes and uh let's see it there's another
      1:36:21
  oh great liza zacker said she had her ravens take a weaving class uh tuning into the talk tonight
      1:36:27
  from sitka so uh we do have time uh for for at least another question
      1:36:34
  if anyone uh wants to send one in via the chat or unmute yourself it looks like saul's already got a question well i i just
      1:36:41
  asked when this is this is when it uh
      1:36:46
  ah oh i was muted or did you i did that sorry it's okay um you know
      1:36:53
  and and this is the influence that finger on e had on me the 11 years i lived there um
      1:36:58
  you know i did my phd a third of my dissertation was written on joy harjo i came to uas
      1:37:05
  claiming you know specialty in native american literature which i don't deny
      1:37:10
  but when i got to sing it on e that's when i discovered and it was primarily through
      1:37:16
  the influence of my good friend ishmael hope that you know uh
      1:37:22
  written poetry like this and its proximity to the oral literary
      1:37:27
  tradition uh and that would be the question i i'd ask our our poets tonight is how has
      1:37:34
  oral literary tradition influenced your written published word
      1:37:45
  can i jump in really quick please so um
      1:37:50
  i would just like to say that quite a few of my poems come from stories that my grandparents shared with
      1:37:56
  me like all of my life and um the re one of the reasons for writing
      1:38:02
  them the poems in the book was that my own children grew up with my
      1:38:08
  grandparents um we were just really lucky that they lived to be you know
      1:38:13
  pretty old and um just as a way to
      1:38:19
  remember those stories and to remember the jokes that they told you know every
      1:38:24
  time you saw them it was but um yeah definitely
      1:38:30
  it's fantastic
      1:38:35
  uh well learning thingit uh you're really trained to do
      1:38:41
  what we call um and not everybody is but some people are
      1:38:48
  and so i i certainly was from uh one of my great uncles and and from a
      1:38:55
  number of folks who who would talk about what you're supposed to do and nora
      1:39:00
  i remember one time cyril george we asked him to give a
      1:39:06
  response to a keynote speech when we hosted the alaska native studies council and
      1:39:13
  it was so incredible because he couldn't hear he couldn't hear anything by that point his hearing was
      1:39:19
  completely gone and i realized that because i drove him home from this event and he kept asking me questions and i was shouting my
      1:39:26
  answers as loud as i could and he could not hear me but
      1:39:31
  we had this wonderful friend steveteen kathy reddy who would sit beside him and type things
      1:39:38
  up for him and for this conference actually hired someone who would just type out the
      1:39:44
  entire keynote speech as it was being spoken on a laptop
      1:39:49
  and cyril was sitting there reading it because he could not hear it and that's what he responded to
      1:39:55
  and when he stood up he was saying when a person talks it's like they put up the house post
      1:40:01
  and when someone stands up and receives those words and responds it's like they put the roof onto the house and sitting
      1:40:08
  like a row or two behind me was nora dallenhauer and he was speaking both clinget and english and she said it's
      1:40:14
  poetry it's poetry she was so excited by what he was doing in that moment
      1:40:20
  and so sometimes i try to capture those things because it's it's an in the moment thing
      1:40:26
  and it's it's it's when you do it in singet it's supposed to be unscripted no notes on
      1:40:32
  your hands no nothing supposed to go and uh and it's a real challenge to do that because
      1:40:38
  sometimes you're talking at a funeral or or you're helping someone with your words and you know that these words
      1:40:44
  might be the the one thing that like they say
      1:40:50
  our language saved us
      1:40:58
  i'm probably more influenced by the klinget culture because that's where i've lived my whole life but
      1:41:04
  in learning about the sami culture i am understanding the influences cultural
      1:41:12
  the cadence cadence the story structure the things that i'm do in my
      1:41:18
  storytelling that carry over into my poetry um
      1:41:23
  digressing our stories repetition and and i too like marie said i'm i'm
      1:41:29
  also writing poetry of the oral histories of my community
      1:41:35
  the sami american community what we've gained or lost in the old country
      1:41:41
  my father's stories contemporary stories lessons things like that so
      1:41:47
  it's all kind of it's hard to separate that but it's all it's all
      1:41:52
  together i guess excellent
      1:42:05
  well this is the this has been just a fabulous uh evening
      1:42:10
  uh i again i can't i can't thank our panelists enough i can't thank jonas
      1:42:16
  enough for for letting me be a part of this um if this was an auditorium right we
      1:42:21

      1:42:31
  multimodal applause
      1:42:36

      1:43:42
  and uh i hope you you go into the world and find more poetry and and
      1:43:48
  i think joy harjo has a has a line that says you know
      1:43:53
  if you're worried about what a poem means when you listen to a song do you
      1:43:59
  do you wonder what the song means just just listen just let your heart tell you what it means
      1:44:04
  so i'm paraphrasing but i hope you go forth and and fill your lives with poetry and uh
      1:44:10
  with indigenous poets for sure
      1:44:15
  good night everyone good night everybody thank you all thank you
