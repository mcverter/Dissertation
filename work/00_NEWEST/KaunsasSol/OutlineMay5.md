The Face of the Earth (פְּנֵ֣י אֲדָמָֽה): An Indigenously-Inspired Levinasian Matrisocial 

"Don't break that tree. Trees are people too" 
  -- Camille Dugee 

Introduction
===============

This paper takes its inspiration from our great friend, the late Sol Neely, asks us to allow the writings of Emmanuel Levinas to become inspired by indigenous thought in order to elaborate an ecological phenomenology that takes ethical responsibility for the "the irreducible kinship relation expressed by 'all my relations' —the utterance itself of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard".  The question of our ethical relationship to nature seems especially pertinent now, both for us right here right now at this conference where we are considering the relationship between humanism and otherness and for us as humans responsible for the exploitation and decimation of the natural world.  

Heraclitus
=============

To do this, we begin by considering Levinas's work as a inversion to not just Heidegger's thinking of Being but moreover as a perversion of Heraclitus's thinking of Becoming, whose dictum  Πάντα ῥεῖ[^1],  everything flows, is complemented by his assertion that war is the master-father of all beings[^2] .  Levinas opens up Totality and Infinity renouncing the "obscure fragments of Heraclitus { that } prove that being reveals itself as war to philosophical thought."[^3]  This idea of becoming as force inspires the entire genealogy descended from Heraclitus, opposition of forces runs through Locke's billiard ball empiricism[^4] and Hobbes's mechanistic[^5] and Hume[^6], Newton's forces, Spinoza's conatus, Hegel's dialectic, Nietzsche's will to power, Heidegger's ecstatic Being, Deleuze, Foucault, as so on.[^7]  


LEVINAS CONTRA HERACLITUS
============================
Levinas's response to this Heraclitus's truth of becoming as war takes many forms

Throughout his work, Levinas dialogue with ontology entails not only a subversion of the meaning of Being but also a further perversion of the notion of Becoming, the tradition that runs from Heraclitus's dictum Πάντα ῥεῖ (everything flows), through Spinoza's conatus essendi as striving to persevere in Being through Hegel's dialectical struggle as becoming, through  Nietzsche's Will to Power as Becoming, through Heidegger's analysis of Being as ecstatic Becoming.

CONTINUOUS CREATION
-------------------
> “the discontinuity of Cartesian time, which requires a continuous creation, indicates the very dispersion and plurality of created being” (TI 58).[

* Jewish sources: HA-ADAMAH: The Face of the Earth
    1. The first blessing before the morning Shema goes on to praise Hashem,
       > “Who, in goodness, perpetually renews creation every day,”

       > mehadesh bekhol yom tamid ma’aseh bereshit
       > ובטובו מחדש בכל יום תמיד מעשה בראשית 

    2.  Psalm 104:29-30 
       > כטתַּסְתִּ֥יר פָּנֶיךָ֘ יִבָּֽהֵ֫ל֥וּן תֹּסֵ֣ף ר֖וּחָם יִגְוָע֑וּן וְאֶל־עֲפָ֘רָ֥ם יְשׁוּבֽוּן:
       >לתְּשַׁלַּ֣ח ר֖וּֽחֲךָ יִבָּֽרֵא֑וּן וּ֜תְחַדֵּ֗שׁ פְּנֵ֣י אֲדָמָֽה:
       
       > You hide Your face and they are frightened; You gather in their breath and they perish and return to their dust.
       > When you send your breath/spirit, they are created,  and you renew the face of the earth

       Metaphorics:
       * REBIRTHING: Death => Life (rebirthing)
       * OTHER/SAME: Their breath => Your breath
       * WASTES/NATURE: Dust => Earth
       * FACE: Your Face => The Face of the Earth
       * death to dust to the earth the face of god is transformed into the face of the earth 
       * the movement of the "Face and the "breath" life and death 
       * In verse 30, the Psalm describes God bringing death to creatures by inhaling their spirits, then creating others by exhaling new breath into their lungs. And thus תחדש פני אדמה, “You renew the face of the earth.”
       * Psalm 104:30 continuous breathing of god

* Descartes and Bergson: Time as continuous creation
>  “the discontinuity of Cartesian time, which requires a continuous creation, indicates the very dispersion and plurality of created being” (TI 58).[

  * Descartes, Bergson, and Continuous Creation, Khafiz Kerimov, https://journals.openedition.org/methodos/5083?lang=en#ftn1
  > Descartes: it does not follow that we shall exist a moment from now, unless there is some cause—the same cause which originally produced us—which continually reproduces us, as it were, that is to say, which keeps us in existence
  > Bergson: [The] idea of creation is altogether absent […] in Greek philosophy: when the Greek divinity intervenes in the world, it does so by arranging it rather than creating, while in Jewish theology God creates the world 

  * Bergson: continued vs continuous -- 
    * pointilism of time of moments, levinas has complex and creative moments of creative duration
    * Kherimov: The conception of the divisibility of time being necessary for Cartesian mechanics, the idea of motion implicates at once the divisibility of time and the divisibility of matter 
    * Bergson: In following the second, on the contrary, he would have been led to all the consequences which the intuition of true duration implies. Creation would have appeared not simply as continued, but also as continuous. The universe, regarded as a whole, would really evolve. The future would no longer be determinable by the present
  * Unforseeable  
    * 33 Henri Bergson (2007), L’évolution créatrice, p. 30: « a continuous creation of an unforeseeable form ».
    * 67 Henri Bergson (2017), L’évolution du problème de la liberté, p. 201: « the human being finds before himself nature and truth that have already been created ».
  * Life Death rebirth: Jean Wahl
    * « [the] thought of death and the thought of forgetting—it is under this double form that the idea of the independence of moments of time is affirmed here »75. Jean Wahl
  * Indeterminacy and freedom
    * something like continuous (as opposed to continued) creation can be glimpsed. What the adjective « continue » suggests here is a kind of creation that never ceases to be creative (in the full sense of the word), inventive, free. It is a creation whose future is indeterminate, unforeseeable, a creation that cannot but unfold « from one moment to another [d'un instant à l'autre] »92. There is something dreamlike or ghostlike about human beings in their freedom. What makes us free is that we comprehend neither whence we are coming nor whither we are going.
    * From the standpoint of universal mechanism, creation is indeed continued: due to the selfsameness of God’s activity, the future is determinable on the basis of the present. From the standpoint of human freedom, on the other hand, creation is continuous, which means that the future is unforeseeable, indeterminate. The time of continuous creation is the time of freedom. Yet, human freedom is inextricably connected with human finitude. To be free for a human being is to be in doubt concerning the future, concerning one’s destination. If Descartes’ chief motivation for continued creation stems from the thesis about the reciprocal independence of temporal moments, then it can be explained equally well by the project of mechanism and by human finitude. If I may cease to exist at the next moment, then the present moment does not entail the existence of the next one. Thus, we see Descartes’ decision to make freedom an exception to mechanism result in two divergent aspects of one and the same doctrine of creation: continued versus continuous creation.

THE ELEMENTAL AS THE FACE OF THE EARTH
--------------------------------------
1. Introduction
   * The environment: The real problem of Levinas scholars is that of the environment and so the defense of humanism has to be the articulate-able with the ecological consciousness.
   * the dread of this primal elemental forces that haunts this work from 30s Hitlerism with the assertion of power as force.  
   * the idea of the heidegger as a being subsuming everything.  the being of beings.  
   * The environment: The real problem of Levinas scholars is that of the environment and so the defense of humanism has to be the articulate-able with the ecological consciousness. 
   * This theme has been explored by many others thinkers of Levinas
   
   >    "Il se déploie dans sa propre dimension la profondeur, inconvertible en largeur et en longueur où s'étend la face de l'élément."
   >    Or rather it has but a side: the surface of the sea and of the field, the edge of the wind; the medium upon which this side** takes form is not composed of things.

2. In contrast to the visage, Levinas uses the French word face to describe the façade or surface of the elemental, the formless depth of materiality. 
3. Lingis, however, translates the face as side, explaining
   > “It is in order to reserve the English word ‘face’ to translate ‘visage’ — the countenance of the Other — that we are using the term ‘side’ to translate ‘face’ in this context.”70 Yet readers should hear both the height of the visage and the depth of the face in the ethical confrontation of the face-à-face.  70 Ibid., p. 131. Translator’s footnote.  3. Element and Things, Implements

4. In his essay on Hitlerism, the is embodied by a force the elemental forces of hitlerism
5. humanism of the other is a series of essays responding to the antihumanism of merleua ponty and heidegger but also a struggle with nietzcheanism.  "Where unfaithfulness to Nietzsche is seen as blasphemy"
6. Check "Time and the Other" / "Existence and Existents" for any connection between il y a and the element
7. In Totality and Infinity 
   * The face of side of the element, 
   * which nourishes us and 
   * threatens the future 
   * An inhumanity as the substance the elemental becomes a sinister thing, 
   * Check to see if he uses the word "inhuman" anywhere
   * which is the status of the
   * unforseeabilty of the future (Bergson)
8. Otherwise than Being
   * Sensibility 

Levinas: Regeneration of generations
-------------------------------------
For Levinas, the generative family demonstrates that, rather than merely issuing from an origin, existence is a continuous creation
* Time as continuous creation, as the genesis of gendered generations, time as continuous regeneration 

There is a sense in which Totality and Infinity may be read as if were the first Book of Moses, Genesis or בְּרֵאשִׁית, { There is a footnote here } the story of the regenerating engendering of generations.  It tells a story of life stage development, from the newborn nursing on the element through job and mature home ownership, through old age, through sex and sacrifice and murder, to the rebirth of a new subjectivity who begins the story at the start in naissance an . At the end you realize that the the sacrifice and murder of the self is what constintued the infant at the beginning.


Amphilogous Oscillations of Temporalized Matter-Waves
------------------------
1. In accord with Levinas’s thinking of inspiration in terms of the literalness of respiration, they are composed with the cadence of breath and attuned to the systole and diastole of the heart.
2. Oscillations and periodicities, sounds, rhythms, reverberations of Xennakis 
3. Substitution is Metaphor
   * Metaphor = meta+phor => phor = to give birth
   * substituion of the self for me
   * replacement over time
   * Here it is being-born and it's relationship with rebirthing
    >    Or do the being encumbered with oneself and the suffering of constriction in one's skin, better than metaphors, follow the exact trope of an alteration of essence, which inverts, or would invert, into a recurrence in which the expulsion of self outside of itself is its substitution for the other?  
4. Examples / Quotes
   * Breathing: inspiration / expiration / respiration, etch
     > The expression "in one's skin" is not a metaphor for the in-itself; it refers to a recurrence in the dead time or the meanwhile which separates inspira- tion and expiration, the diastole and systole of the heart beating dully against the walls of one's skin. The body is not only an image or figure here; it is the distinctive in-oneself of the contraction of ipseity and its breakup.12 This contraction is not an impossibility to forget oneself, to detach oneself from oneself, in the concern for oneself. It is a recurrence to oneself out of an irrecusable exigency of the other, a duty overflowing my being, a duty becoming a debt and an extreme passivity prior to the tran- quillity, still quite relative, in the inertia and materiality of things at rest. It is a restlessness and patience that support prior to action and passion. Here what is due goes beyond having, but makes giving possible. This recurrence is incarnation. In it the body which makes giving possible makes one other without alienating. For this other is the heart, and the goodness, of the same, the inspiration or the very psyche in the soul.
    * River / Water / Heraclitus 
      > Rather than being a metaphor taken from the movement of waters in a river, would not flowing be the very temporality of time and the "science" of which "consciousness" (conscience) is made? To speak of time in terms of flowing is to speak of time in terms of time and not in terms of temporal events.18 The temporalization of time-the openness by which sensation manifests itself, is felt, modifies itself without altering its identity, doubling itself up by a sort of diastasis of the punctual, putting itself out of phase with itself-is neither an attribute nor a predicate expressing a causality "sensed" as a sensation. The temporal modification is not an event, nor an action, nor the effect of a cause. It is the verb to be.
      > The ego is in itself like a sound that would resound in its own echo, the node of a wave which is not once again consciousness.6 The term in recurrence will be sought here beyond or on the hither side of consciousness and its play, beyond or on the hither side of being which it thematizes, outside of being, and thus in itself as in exile. 
      > Indeed in the transcendence of intentionality diachrony is reflected, that is, the psyche itself, in which the inspiration of the same by the other is articulated as a responsibility for another, in proximity. Sensibility is in this way situated back in the human exception. But one has to go back from this reflection to the diachrony itself, which is the-one-for-the-other in proximity. It is then not a particular signification. The-one-for-another has the form of sensibility or vulnerability, pure passivity or susceptibility, passive to the point of becoming an inspiration, that is, alterity in the same, the trope of the body animated by the soul, psyche in the form of a hand that gives even the bread taken from its own mouth. Here the psyche is the maternal body.


Quantum and Relativity Physics
------------------------------
  1. Reimann/ Einstein curvature of space time  gravity  
  2. Material things as a standing wave, as an interference pattern, a deBroglie wave packet or matter wave, the amphibology of a standing presence and a fluctuation of the continuous creation of becoming
  3. De Broglie called this wave the "phase wave" («onde de phase» in French)
  4. Background radiation.    Electrical network frequency (ENF) analysis is an audio forensics technique for validating audio recordings by comparing frequency changes in background mains hum in the recording with long-term high-precision historical records of mains frequency changes from a database. In effect the mains hum signal is treated as if it were a time-dependent digital watermark that can help identify when the recording was created, detect edits in the recording, or disprove tampering of a recording.

[^4]: "Neither have we from body any idea of the beginning of motion. A body at rest affords us no idea of any active power to move; and when it is set in motion itself, that motion is rather a passion, than an action in it. For when the ball obeys the motion of a billiard stick, it is not any action of the ball, but bare passion: also when by impulse it sets another ball in motion that lay in its way, it only communicates the motion it had received from another, and loses in itself so much as the other received: which gives us but a very obscure idea of an active power moving in body, whilst we observe it only to transfer, but not produce any motion. For it is but a very obscure idea of power, which reaches not the production of the action, but the continuation of the passion."
