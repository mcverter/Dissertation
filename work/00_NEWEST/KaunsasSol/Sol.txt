 Such an “inspired” eco-phenomenology accords well with “Lingít
tundataani” (Tlingit thinking), which is born of this transcendence of words.
The word “lingít” means “human”;

The humanism of the other person
requires this “fundamental historicity” (diachrony
as ancestry) and a “hearing the land speak,” which is always already storied
and ecological in ways that cultures of usurpation are historically tone deaf
toward. On

other person nature diachrony as ancestry 

so means this: “[I]n social relations the real presence
of the other is important; but above all it means that this presence, far from signifying pure and simple coexistence with me, or expressing itself through the
romantic metaphor of ‘living presence,’ is fulfilled in the act of hearing” (148).
This is radical, and Bruns picks up on what is unique here to Levinas: It’s not that
sound is the medium of utterances; it’s that utterances become the medium of sound
itself (107). The sounds and noises of nature disappoint when they are not heard
from the point of view of the utterance, when they remain mired in the tranquility and materiality of things at rest, registered only in the medium of sound
with all its aesthetic self-sufficiency. In contrast, it is the social relation—the
irreducible kinship relation expressed by “all my relations”—the utterance itself
of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard
through an inspired eco-phenomenology. This does not mean that Levinas
characteristically hierarchizes “ethical (i.e., human
