I find Alaska especially inspiring because you walk out into the woods and there's a holiness and there's a magic to the forest that can't be found anywhere else. You become immediately connected to the environment around you. 

That is literally inspiring. The word inspiring means to breathe life into. You can walk out into the forest and you can walk out into the glacier fields and you can be renewed and restored in spirit. 

You find a kind of relation with the world that you don't find elsewhere. Oftentimes you, you know, the city urban centers cut you off your relations with others and with the world around you.
