        4:23
    was just sharing a little bit in in thing it's that to think that people the
        4:28
    AH Kwan and one of my ancestors names was on a school from the wish Keaton and
        4:36
    I just feel it's very grateful being on their land and also the NAD on our
        4:44
    Ravens side and I wanted to just in think it first and then a little bit in
        4:51
    English share my appreciation for Saul and his father George daughter Mila and
        5:00
    I've gotten to know Saul more in over the past 10 years I'll talk a little bit
        5:08
    more about about him in a minute but just I was just sharing the appreciation
        5:14
    of him being an indigenous person on this thing good territory which this is
        5:21
    gonna be called The Raven bioregion is it's actually a thing my father and II
        5:27
    hope the third coined he called it the Raven creator bioregion but since
        5:32
    Richard Nora da mineira didn't like calling the Raven a creator and and preferred the term and Demiurge I kind
        5:40
    of switched to just call it a Raven bioregion and that's sort of the northwest coast of you know of this area
        5:49
    where there's the Raven and it's interesting to see that that these these
        5:55
    epic stories of the transformation of land and having a characteristic of one
        6:02
    being that represents that thing that's unpredictable and and maybe wild and non-human being
        6:12
    embodied and that's that's the thing that happens with we called the trickster or Demiurge or a creator but
        6:20
    we have the Raven in North West Coast so I really I just admire Saul and and
        6:28
    really look forward to hearing hearing from him but let's let's introduce the
        6:34
    speakers George Neely is from Lodi California
        6:40
    he's retired Army officer we just met but we've we've known each other we've
        6:46
    known about each other through Saul you know just from from all the amazing
        6:51
    conversations and connections and and things that we talk about and George is
        6:58
    a retired Army officer he's retired from GE in the corporate world and he's a
        7:05
    retired schoolteacher and Mila Neely is
        7:11
    in fourth grade and she loves Cherokee
        7:16
    being Cherokee you know oftentimes we get we had told that we're of descent
        7:22
    when were like we're we're of Cherokee descent or clink it descent but you
        7:29
    can't divide yourself up like that if you identify with that that ancestral
        7:34
    belonging that's who you are and there's no question so I just it's neat to see
        7:43
    just observing me lad just loving being Cherokee and she also is going to so
        7:53
    yaik gasps no school and is learning klinken song-and-dance learning the
        8:00
    language saying things like one time said to me yo Aosta tini or - yay across a teen and
        8:07
    then I said you can to your question team so I and and we also have Saul and
        8:16
    Saul is a PhD from Purdue University I actually went
        8:22
    to his alma mater and spent time with his teacher sander good heart who
        8:29
    they're their leading philosophers and critical theorists and Saul is a leading
        8:36
    indigenous critical theorist because like James Thomas Stevens my mohawk poet
        8:43
    colleague he once talked about another Native poet and said although he doesn't
        8:49
    ever directly address his own native heritage he's native because he has a native mind
        8:56
    you know and and so but additionally in addition to that you know as we see deep
        9:04
    concerns of wanting to know what it means to be indigenous Cherokee you know
        9:13
    and on fling Kotani which in many of his classes would have taken taken many of
        9:19
    his classes that's often the question he talks he brings up how do we address these concerns while living on fling
        9:26
    Kidani you know and I'm I've just deeply appreciated that so I he's a PhD from Purdue from with
        9:37
    with in religion religious studies and literature literature comparative
        9:44
    literature please excuse me he could correct me in a minute and I just looked
        9:49
    up his bio and I muscle space this but he he also went to University of Alaska
        9:56
    Anchorage for his bachelor's and later MA in English so he's got these long
        10:04
    connections with Alaska ten years being a professor here at UAS but also that
        10:10
    experience in the earlier 2000s getting his his earlier education and I think I
        10:19
    probably said all the things I was wanting to say about Saul I just I I
        10:24
    just admire the intellectual vitality
        10:30
    that when there were people like Richard and Nora down our who've been in these spaces for many
        10:35
    many many many times as speakers as panelists and in the audience and when
        10:43
    people like them pass on and and they brought a milieu a cultural and
        10:48
    intellectual milieu of deep richness and broadness and greatness that you you you
        10:58
    missed that when people like that who you know go on and so when you have an
        11:05
    exciting you know young indigenous scholar in addition to sander Goodheart
        11:12
    I put his intellectual lineage to Linda Smith who published decolonizing
        11:18
    methodologies and on my o'clock Oscar Quigley and maybe he who published a you
        11:25
    back worldview which is that equally as as innovative and influential even if
        11:30
    not why as widely known as decolonized methodologies and even if Saul hasn't
        11:36
    published something like that yet that's the kind of thinker I that's the kind of
        11:42
    respect I have for him as a thinker um so goodness Qi show where I ID plea look
        11:49
    forward to hearing from Saul George and Milla okay
        12:02
    sheesh I asked Ishmael to stay up here for a second because I wanted to acknowledge
        12:08
    the very generous and kind words that he he just spoke and as we sort of this is
        12:15
    still part of the intro and welcoming but I'm also have to jump right into a little bit of the presentation which is a very quick biographical sketch so that
        12:22
    this makes sense to you I thought about calling this talk becoming Cherokee in
        12:29
    the Raven bioregion and students of mine know that I'm actually pretty allergic to the vocabulary of being I prefer the
        12:36
    vocabularies becoming and but as Ishmael
        12:42
    was just saying you know it's it's the ancestral connection is there so it
        12:49
    makes sense to talk about being as well but I just want to say as a child I was
        12:55
    raised by my grandfather to feel fiercely proud of being Cherokee there's there was no doubt I comported myself I
        13:01
    behaved I was a Cherokee child but that kind of that confidence kind of failed
        13:07
    at some point in our family life when I was 18 and I graduated high school I was gonna go live with my uncle
        13:14
    my great uncle my grandfather's brother whose name is Sequoia that everybody called him bull and I was gonna live
        13:21
    with my uncle Bullock's he was the last fluent speaker in our family and but he had a stroke and he lost the ability to
        13:28
    talk and I was pretty devastated by that and I remember talking to my grandpa and he said to me how does it feel to be the
        13:34
    last of the damn Mohicans and you know at some point in my early 20s you know
        13:42
    my dad was also saying we gonna talk about this tonight as well also was just saying look man you got to give it up just give it up right needs to go go
        13:48
    steady European philosophy he had just finished college and loves Socrates go study Socrates and but I had this
        13:56
    concern that the richness of that ancestral and genealogical strength would silently vanish and I never did
        14:02
    give it up I did study Native American living in grad school it was an area of concentration when I applied for the job
        14:08
    at UAS one of my sample syllabi was a course called trickster Herman
        14:13
    and I ended up teaching that class the first summer here and that's how I first met Ishmael he came to the class and he
        14:18
    told Ravens stories and then later on when he took some of my my classes I got
        14:24
    to drive him home every night and the joke was I had Tuesdays with Ishmael and
        14:30
    he was such a just wonderful wonderful conversations and the drive from here
        14:36
    back to Douglas and I told him this story the brief biographical sketches I
        14:42
    just told you and he came back like a week later and said I want you to know that that's really meaningful to me I to
        14:48
    know you know that like so many other native families it only takes a generation to really lose that proximity
        14:55
    in that rootedness in it and from then on Israel really resuscitated and
        15:01
    transformed my indigenous genealogy and really celebrated me as an indigenous scholar but he did it modish me in a
        15:08
    really really powerful way and he said you can lay out your credentials in
        15:15
    Native American literature but unless you were close to the oral literary source material it means very little and
        15:22
    that's why I talked about becoming Cherokee in the Raven bioregion because it's precisely the oral literary
        15:29
    traditions and the modalities of consciousness that attend to that that
        15:34
    have proved profoundly transformed me as a thinker and you know Ernestine Hayes
        15:42
    will say education saves generations well as this presentation shows and is and is that my father my daughter here
        15:50
    proved Ishmael's influence on my life has saved generations and so it's a
        15:59
    small token of our appreciation but it's a full-sized facsimile of the
        16:05
    first Cherokee phenotype age of the first Cherokee Phoenix bilingual
        16:10
    Cherokee and English newspaper the first Native American newspaper in the United
        16:16
    States it came out in 1828 and we brought this from New Echota Georgia where the printing press was originally
        16:22
    located so that's what we wanted to go thank you
        16:45
    thanks everybody for coming hello YouTube world as promised
        16:54
    tonight's presentation I'm gonna read a little bit of script here but it's mostly gonna be extemporaneous is okay
        17:07
    powerpoint is not advancing help
        17:25
    we checked it all
        17:48
    we should have his six o'clock to run through all of this
        18:09
    they're talking I can hear through the headphone
        18:21
    are you getting are you getting
        18:46
    are you giving it now are you getting it now
        19:16
    while they're working on that neither
        19:21
    may the joke as we were traveling that it was actually for generations because
        19:27
    pickles joined us pickles with
        19:33
    everywhere oh no no no no no the auto
        19:38
    recovery is gonna crash it it's gonna crash it
        19:50
    while they're doing this I'll just say if you have a MacBook Pro and you have not up created your software to catalina
        19:56
    yet don't do it I ate up all the extra space of my hard
        20:02
    drive and yeah thank you thank you thank you alright so as promised tonight's
        20:08
    presentation will feature memoir which have already offered a bit of and some
        20:14
    story some critical theory if I was pressed to identify genre of this presentation I would say that it's Auto
        20:22
    ethnography and so what is Auto ethnography here's a succinct definition
        20:28
    I called from the internet it is quote qualitative research in which an author
        20:34
    uses self reflection and writing to explore anecdotal and personal experience and connect this
        20:39
    autobiographical story to wider cultural political and social meanings and understandings here's another definition
        20:46
    I like quote Auto ethnography is an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically
        20:54
    analyze personal experience in order to understand cultural experience this
        20:59
    approach challenges canonical ways of doing research and representing others and treats research as political
        21:06
    socially just and socially conscious act a researcher uses tenets of
        21:11
    autobiography and ethnography to do and write Auto ethnography thus as a method
        21:17
    auto ethnography is both process and product I hadn't actually thought to
        21:22
    describe my sabbatical research in those terms until recently when an editor of the Peace Chronicle reached out and
        21:29
    asked if I would contribute an auto ethnographic essay for the journal and I realize that Auto ethnography is exactly
        21:37
    what I'm doing here the coincidence of the personal and the existential with the political and cultural is one I
        21:44
    usually adopt anyway and I owe that tendency to some of my graduate professors who Ishmael mentioned like Martin Mateusz too can stand a good
        21:51
    heart both of whom encouraged this braiding of concern in their critical theory and philosophical practice for
        21:58
    years I've privileged the vocabulary of genealogy because it offers us not just history
        22:03
    but as Michele Foucault writes a history of the present genealogy is always
        22:08
    already storied it is situated adopts a perspective remains open to
        22:14
    interpretation and it's always in a state of becoming we have our personal genealogies and we have our cultural and
        22:21
    political genealogies Auto ethnography provides a methodology for reading these personal cultural and political
        22:28
    genealogies through each other rendering various aspects of our auto ethnographic
        22:33
    work more or less legible depending on the apertures through which we focus our
        22:38
    attention that is why I like the second definition of Auto ethnography as both process and product we are reminded that
        22:46
    every one of us has a story even as none of us are reducible to our histories
        22:51
    when we adopt such an approach we realize that the quality of our relations is not uniquely occasion by
        22:59
    what we intend we can approach our work from intentional consciousness but we
        23:04
    must remain open to that which comes to us from beyond ourselves we must remain
        23:09
    open to revelation things and relations that do not have their origins within our own idiosyncratic intentions and
        23:17
    this was true for us during our journey when we had unbelievable uncanny moments
        23:25
    of Revelation and strange coincidences and as we started out I made a post on
        23:31
    Facebook in Louise Brady from the kik said he clan and sitka wrote your
        23:36
    ancestors are guiding you and that certainly seemed to be the case because there were too many coincidences for
        23:42
    that not to be true so tonight's presentation arrives in two parts and the first part will describe our journey
        23:48
    of the Trail of Tears by appeal to genealogy and history and in the second
        23:55
    part I'll give some brief meditations on the cosmopolitan in critical aspect of what this means to me living in fing
        24:02
    Adani and so as I do this I'm going to invite my dad and my daughter to
        24:09
    interrupt whenever they want they have a live mic and we'll stay cognizant of the time it will move through this and a fun
        24:15
    and an expeditious way interrupts anytime
        24:22
    dad yeah yeah so this is actually a
        24:35
    slide so when we got back we meal and I give a brief presentation at Hearst
        24:41
    class and so I made this slide for the kids so they could just get a sense of where we were at and where the Trail of
        24:48
    Tears occurred in relationship to Juneau Alaska but this is a pretty nice map and
        24:55
    you can see does it okay if I take this out so you can see here's Georgia and
        25:06
    our ancestors come from the area around Dahlonega Georgia this is where their
        25:12
    land was around the Etowah River and the Chestatee River and they had their land
        25:17
    stolen from them in 1832 and what we did
        25:23
    is we started in New Echota Georgia this was the last capital of the cherokee
        25:28
    nation before the removal and we went up to red clay State Historic Park we'll talk about this in more detail here in a
        25:34
    minute and then we took a detour to
        25:40
    Cherokee North Carolina which is the capital of the Eastern Band of Cherokee and then we reconnected back over here
        25:48
    at Blythe Ferry and we took the northern route the red one the Trail of Tears and
        25:56
    so that's the route we took it's the longest route and it's the route that most Cherokees who are on the Trail of
        26:02
    Tears had to take Oh gotcha okay so what
        26:10
    we did is we followed the the northern route right there
        26:15
    just to lay out some generation they have some genealogy this has been really
        26:21
    fun research to do and so we've laid our

    my great-great great-great-great grandmother and I talked a little bit about them here just briefly my fifth
        27:02
    great-grandmother was a lot totaiiy and I found historical documents where she
        27:07
    was listed as Miss laughs ty which i think is funny and she was born in 1765
        27:14
    and she died in 1832 you can see she died in Cherokee Nation Indian Territory in Oklahoma that's the same year that
        27:20
    they were they were forced off their land in Georgia and sent to Oklahoma so she barely survived that removal and
        27:28
    then my great-great-great Graham great-great great-great grandmother call what it isn't that great is meal and I
        27:34
    studied Cherokee it's cool the Cherokee language has an unvoiced L just like linkit so qual what and her eating the
        27:43
    same was Elizabeth Graves Terrell born in 1788 Cherokee Nation East and then died again in Cherokee Nation Indian
        27:49
    Territory in Oklahoma she married a guy named John Jack Tyrell it was adopted by the Cherokee Nation and when they were
        27:56
    forced to move in 1832 all but two of their children went and my great great
        28:02

        28:09
    the Trail of Tears in the Nancy Terrell my great-great-great grandmother again

        28:22
    the three of them all they all they all move together into what is today
        28:29
    Oklahoma and then my great-great grandfather Andrew Jackson Robertson he's the first generation born after the
        28:35
    removal in Cherokee Nation Indian Territory nobody in my family knows why he's got the name Andrew Jackson
        28:41
    robertson like nobody knows but my middle name is jackson my dad's middle
        28:47
    name is jackson and so that's carried on in our family and he was brilliant he
        28:53
    was a leader in the rebuilding of the cherokee nation after the removal he was fifteen years old he made bricks for the
        29:00
    cherokee courthouse which is the center of Tahlequah Oklahoma it's just it's an architectural gem very very there's a
        29:09
    great sense of pride around that building he served on Tahlequah Council
        29:14
    he was he served on the old settlers council he was elected to Cherokee
        29:19
    National Council Tribal Council for two years he started a post office just a
        29:26
    just a brilliant very influential man and he was known as Uncle Jack everybody called him Uncle Jack my dad was telling
        29:32
    me that even my grandpa so like he's my grandpa's grandpa and even my grandpa
        29:38
    called him uncle Jack and then he gave birth to Bill Biddy Allie Robertson and
        29:46
    and she was my great-grandmother who then gave birth to my grandpa Lucien
        29:51
    Buffington Neely Buffington is a Cherokee chief and that's another middle name that's been passed down my brothers
        29:56
    middle name is Buffington and and my dad
        30:01
    will actually say a couple of things about them before I go into the time
        30:07
    line all right Uncle Jack was quite the
        30:16
    character he was the is one of the main people who
        30:24
    helped the Cherokee Nation in telecoil become what it is so we were very proud
        30:29
    of him but it's interesting by the way my dad did not die in 29 9400 here we
        30:35
    have a little bit of a type over there all right it was 2004 just wishful thinking he really is and he's here with
        30:43
    us tonight you can see that that Uncle
        30:48
    Jack died in February 1934 and then my father's mother died in April
        30:55
    of 34 my dad was 10 11 years old when
        31:01
    she passed away and I heard a lot of stories about now it's about what you
        31:06
    were talking about earlier about being or becoming Cherokee and and that it's
        31:13
    funny what happened it's funny what happened back in then and I say funny not haha my grandmother
        31:22
    was a strong Cherokee woman and I noticed by the oral of you know my
        31:28
    father telling me stories and his brothers telling story I said that no one came to her house
        31:33
    this was back during the tough times or any depression no one came to her house and was turned away she fed everybody
        31:39
    that came by and my father saw that I think that that's one of the things that
        31:45
    that made him like he was he was such a giving man but you know what happened
        31:50
    during this time period they moved away
        31:56
    from being Cherokee they they kind of lost that this all talked about his
        32:04
    grandfather helping bring him up Cherokee that didn't happen when I was a
        32:10
    kid you know my dad would he'd always said that oh we're Okies and he said
        32:17
    that it didn't talk that much about being Native Americans so we kind of lost that but thanks to Saul we're
        32:25
    getting that back and I really really appreciate that but so my dad left
        32:31
    Oklahoma left telecoil went out to California along with many other people from that time period and that's where
        32:38
    that's where we grew up and that's where we lost a thing about being jerky but I'm gonna talk about that a little bit
        32:44
    later and and what happened on this trip but a great people it was uh it was a
        32:52
    pleasure my dad was just an incredible man and later he became Cherokee again
        33:00
    yeah and and so here's a quick timeline for just to contextualize the history
        33:07
    here in 1802 the federal government promise Georgia that it would remove all indian titles to land in
        33:13
    exchange for ceding land that became alabama and mississippi during you know
        33:19
    1817 to 1835 the federal government offered Cherokees who wanted to
        33:25
    voluntarily emigrate to Indian Territory means an access to do that and they
        33:30
    became known as the old settlers in 1830 Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act but in 1832
        33:37
    the first Gold Rush in the United States occurred near Dahlonega Georgia and things became very brutal that's when
        33:43
    they started the six land lottery and that's how my ancestors lost their land
        33:49
    in 1832 there's also a landmark case a Supreme Court case called Wurster versus the state of Georgia and the Supreme
        33:56
    Court actually sided with the Cherokee Nation but Andrew Jackson refused to
        34:04
    follow to follow the Supreme Court ruling he said Chief John Marshall made his
        34:12
    decision now let him enforce it which is sort of a famous saying and so then you
        34:18
    know in 1832 you can see our direct ancestors immigrated to Indian Territory I mentioned that already in 1835 the
        34:25
    Treaty of New Echota was signed and the Treaty of New Echota was very controversial there was a group of
        34:32
    Cherokee leaders liest Buddha not major Ridge John Ridge Andrew Ross and some
        34:38
    others and they felt like okay look we're losing everything I mean you gotta December 1835 treaty after treaty after
        34:45
    treaty was violated multiple Cherokee towns were burned repeatedly over and over and over again in 1828 the state of
        34:52
    Georgia made a rule that Cherokees could not congregate except for one purpose and that was to cede land and so it was
        34:59
    really vicious and so these Cherokee leaders thought look the only thing we can do is move take provisions that the
        35:06
    federal government are gonna offer us take the land and establish our sovereignty in Indian Territory but most
        35:14
    of the Cherokee Nation thought that they were traitors and immediately John Ross who was principle chief of the
        35:20
    Cherokee Nation at the time wrote a letter saying look this is not the position of the Cherokee Nation and
        35:25
    16,000 Cherokee people signed that letter and they sent it to Congress but still that treaty was ratified by a
        35:32
    single vote thus laying down the legal groundwork for the Trail of Tears and then in 1838
        35:39
    1839 that was the actual Trail of Tears in 1839 my my great-great-great uncle
        35:45
    Thomas signed an old settler resolution and what that resolution did is I mean
        35:51
    you can imagine this there were there are multiple factions but there were three main factions at the time there was the old settlers and they had
        35:58
    established their own government in Indian Territory then there was the lay
        36:04
    coming old settlers like my ancestors and then there was the immigrants from
        36:10
    the trailer tears you know another 12,000 Cherokee showing up who also have
        36:15
    an established political system under John Ross chief John Ross and so in 1839
        36:20
    the old settler resolution deposed the old settler leadership and an
        36:27
    established principle Chief John Ross and then you got some pretty vicious
        36:33
    acts of legislation they'd followed that in 1887 the Dawes Act which inaugurated
        36:39
    allotment so you know Cherokee land was held in common but then the Dawes Act
        36:45
    allotted 160 acre lots of land individual Cherokee families and they
        36:50
    sold off the rest to white settlers in 1898 the curtis act was sort of an extension of that for the cherokee
        36:57
    nation 1904 my family a lot of it happened in fact I just got the record
        37:02
    for that which is great like two weeks ago we figured out where exactly my family's along it was cuz it's lost now
        37:09
    and then in 1907 Oklahoma became a state so yeah so that's that's some history
        37:15
    and some background and we can get into the the the journeys time-lapse of us landing are heading into Dahlonega and
        37:22
    new Achor New Echota so like I said New Echota
        37:27
    when we visited there it's the it was the capital of the cherokee nation from
        37:33
    1825 to 1835 it was a vibrant robust town and it
        37:40
    wasn't always populated but when the Cherokees were meeting in tribal council it was it was a very rich vibrant town
        37:47
    they had a two-story council house they had a Supreme Court a print shop and the print shop is where the Cherokee Phoenix
        37:53
    the paper I was just talking about was first published in 1828 and its editor
        38:00
    was Elias Boudinot who was one of the people who signed the Treaty of New Echota and Sequoia had introduced the
        38:09
    alphabet at the syllabary that he invented in 1821 and it was really
        38:14
    intense to sort of be there at at New Echota and milla what what happened to
        38:21
    you and knew your children I got bit by fire and welcome to the south so a
        38:36
    grasshopper jumped off of the top of a building and it didn't land on its legs
        38:43
    and I was carrying it for a really long time and then I found a log and so I put
        38:50
    him by the log and I didn't realize that I stepped on a mound of fire ants and
        38:57
    then I says I just saw like told me shoot I just swipe them off and then
        39:04
    like five minutes later I felt it like a really bad stain on my leg and yeah and
        39:13
    her girl saw the fire yeah I was intense
        39:26
    and you know in New Echota it was pretty intense to to be on to be on that land
        39:31
    we were the only ones out there that day we had the whole the whole village was just us and so we got to sort of be
        39:39
    intimate with both with each other and with the place but the new which showed
        39:44
    is the place where that treaty was signed in 1835 and however a controversy it was it was very controversial because
        39:51
    after the removal the people who signed the the leaders who signed the New Echota treaty were killed they lost
        39:59
    their lives for it because there was a Cherokee law that if you purposefully get rid of some matter of fact it was
        40:05
    John Ridge when he signed the treaty said I'm signing my death warrant
        40:10
    yeah that's right that's right that's right exactly I'm signing my death and yeah and they did because the Cherokee
        40:18
    law was if you purposely give away Cherokee land it's it's as you lose your life and here's a crazy thing major
        40:27
    Ridge he was one of the signers John ridges father he saved Andrew Jackson's life in battle
        40:34
    like in the early 1820s I think so that's a profound irony okay but but one
        40:41
    more thing about that Treaty of New Echota you probably have heard that the Cherokee Nation is getting
        40:48
    representation in United Sates Congress that's from this treaty right and so
        40:54
    before going on this trip I also adopted this perspective that the treaty party was kind of a traitor party but we
        41:00
    discovered how complicated and how complex this history is and it's not it's not an easy history after that we
        41:09
    went to Chief John Ross house this is where he lived as a child and before the removal
        41:15
    and this was really neat for us because
        41:20
    there were a few places along our journey where we had a destination and we arrived at the destination and there
        41:28
    was nobody there and so we would contact somebody or call somebody and told them our stories and
        41:35
    they would open these places that for us and this was one of them we went to you can see in the background there you can
        41:40
    see how industrial it is all around this house so you've got Chief John Ross his house on this little bit of land but
        41:46
    right next door is a big insurance building across the street is a warehouse so this the the city's creeped
        41:51
    up all around it and but we were there and there's a fence around his house and
        41:57
    we couldn't get in and we were really frustrated by this this fence and just as we're about to get in the
        42:03
    car and leave we hung out there a little bit by ourselves I just notice that there was a phone number associated with the house on the internet so I called it
        42:11
    I said and some lady answered the phone and I told her our story and within five
        42:16
    minutes they had the caretaker down and he opened it up for us and he he he was a brilliant oral historian of that place
        42:22
    of John Ross of everything that was going on there so we talked with him for a couple of hours and it was it was
        42:27
    really brilliant and milla what do you remember about the house there was a
        42:36
    longbow on top of a fireplace and I do
        42:44
    archery in my driveway because I stole my dad's bow and it was really cool to
        42:55
    see the longbow yeah and Dad you what
        43:02
    are you the caretaker and I've much more
        43:07
    than they they just didn't just take care of the place he really knew the history of that area and and the house
        43:14
    and everything and he filled us in not only on the time period during and
        43:22
    leading up to the Trail of Tears but also up through the Civil War and how the house fared in the Civil War and all
        43:27
    that was really interesting so again that the oral history I don't know that any place that we could find that yeah I
        43:34
    think it's right yeah so that that was extraordinarily special and and then
        43:43
    after that we headed to red-clay State Park and this is located in Tennessee
        43:49
    this is one of our most special moments on the trip it's the last it's red clay
        43:57
    is the site of the last Cherokee Tribal Council before the Trail of Tears and it's just above the Tennessee just above
        44:04
    the Georgia border into Tennessee because remember Georgians did not allow Cherokee to congregate for any reason
        44:12
    except to cede land and so they had their last Tribal Council here here's the sacred Springs they chose
        44:17
    this site because of these sacred Springs and you know what why don't you
        44:24
    tell the story so that's the sacred
        44:31
    Springs and the Cherokee stayed there
        44:36
    [Music] and they called it the Blue Hole because
        44:43
    in the middle of the springs the water is blue and it looks like it's only like
        44:52
    five feet but it actually goes down like 14 feet and I'm the water spider is a
        44:59
    very important animal and Cherokee
        45:05
    culture because that's how and there's a
        45:13
    story that the water spider brought their Cherokees the first fire and there
        45:22
    were water spiders in the water yeah this was a trip of special events
        45:31
    special times this was probably one of the most special times that we had you saw early there there was a park
        45:39
    ranger there her name was Erin she's been here 13 years and she told me says
        45:44
    I've only made one arrest since I've been here and that was for a non Cherokee woman that crossed over into
        45:53
    that that spring that was all fenced off with no trespassing signs and all she
        46:00
    opened that up for us and let us go in and it was just a really really special
        46:05
    moment it is a incredible place and again you know Georgia wouldn't uh would
        46:13
    not allow Cherokees to meet in their area and so we sort of had a we coated
        46:22
    our Cherokee baptism being able to get into this sacred Springs like that it's also the site of
        46:28
    an eternal flame because in 1984 the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation held
        46:34
    a tribal council there once more is the first one since the Trail of Tears and so they put up a an eternal flame which
        46:43
    is really lovely and then from there we probably went to one of the most
        46:48
    significant cultural experiences of the entire trip Waffle House
        46:58
    Milas first Waffle House I was raised in the southeast there's like two out of
        47:04
    every corner you think there's a lot of Starbucks there's a lot of waffle houses in the south did you like it either yeah
        47:13
    but that was at the end of this incredible day that we had the Waffle House dinner was but okay now I'll talk
        47:21
    about one of our more difficult days that we had for a couple of reasons from there we headed up to forecasts near the
        47:27
    city of Charleston it says site of forecasts Trail of Tears National Historic Trail now this was a difficult
        47:33
    day because I we were using one of the resources we were using to research the
        47:39
    trip was Barbara Duncan's book she would cover it with Brett Riggs and it was an amazing book
        47:45
    Barbara Duncan is an amazing Cherokee scholar and she she wrote about
        47:50
    forecasts and there's nothing there's no Memorial there but what forecast was is
        47:56
    it was the site of almost all of the concentration camps in which Cherokees were were detained rounded up and
        48:04
    detained before they were shipped on the Trail of Tears something like 14,000
        48:09
    Cherokee people were locked up in these concentration camps for castes itself
        48:14
    was 10 miles wide and 16 miles long almost two thousand Cherokees died even
        48:20
    before the Trail of Tears started so it's I call it the ground zero of removal um
        48:26
    but you go through there and you know they set up these concentration camps here because there was a spring
        48:33
    rattlesnake Springs but you can't get to it because everything is private farmland I had stolen private farmland
        48:41
    and so we were going through these roads trying to figure out where things were and there's no Memorial there's no sign
        48:48
    there's no there's nothing and I was reminded of Tony Morrison who writes about the Middle Passage she says
        48:54
    there's there's no bench there's no Memorial there's no Museum and it really felt like that and so we were driving
        49:01
    around the area the Hiwassee River and we hooked up with part of the original trailer tears and we drove that and then
        49:08
    we Mila was the whole trip had a little passport book and we were hitting all these stops along the National Historic
        49:15
    Trail and she'd give him stamped right so we went into the Cherry the Hiwassee River Heritage Center to get her stamp
        49:20
    do you want to buy this you look like you yeah I can't even think the lady's
        49:27
    name that we met there but she basically just changed history
        49:32
    you know she was trying to tell us how the Trail of Tears wasn't so bad you
        49:38
    know many many of the the Cherokees actually just left the Trail of Tears
        49:44
    they didn't die they just left because the the land was so nice that they moved on to that and just stayed there and she
        49:53
    was talking I have to kept maneuvering myself between Saul and her so the key
        49:59
    but he handled it well he you know did not go off on the lady but it is amazing
        50:06
    how people can change his she believes that you know she doesn't want to
        50:11
    believe anything bad about her little area right there and I know she's trying
        50:16
    but it was first time we'd run into that and you know what that was actually the
        50:22
    only time that we ran into somebody who did that but the whole air it was either it was gone and there was no relics of
        50:31
    the concentration camps and that's exactly what they were they concentrated that the Cherokees there
        50:38
    and then they sent them out in groups of eight hundred to a thousand with leaders
        50:44
    and they negotiated that this Trail of Tears so this was nothing more
        50:51
    concentration camp and they tried to change it and make it into something that was a little more palatable Franco
        50:59
    she kept saying what the media wants you to think that it's really bad yeah real
        51:04
    quick if you see this Nancy word he said High Priestess of the Cherokee loyal friend to the white settlers so
        51:11
    right after we left forecast area in that Heritage Center we went to the grave of Nancy Ward she was the last
        51:18
    beloved woman of the Cherokee and we went to her grave and there were all these markers up by Daughters of the
        51:25
    American Revolution and again what we encountered was just more historical revision right I mean High Priestess of
        51:32
    the chair that's not vocab it's not charity ball Cavalleri right well friend to the white settlers no
        51:38
    it's a little more complicated than that but it was it was it was that was why it
        51:45
    was a difficult day you know following on the tail of the previous day and then
        51:51
    we headed out to Cherokee North Carolina so we took kind of a detour because if
        51:57
    we would have stayed on the direct route we would have gone from forecast to to
        52:03
    Blythe Ferry but we took a detour into Cherokee North Carolina we saw some the
        52:10
    two beautiful museums there's a Museum of the Cherokee Indian there then they got the O'Connell oofta Indian village it's a living museum that we got to
        52:17
    visit where they've they've Brett Riggs and other great scholars of Cherokee
        52:23
    history created this village and you can walk around it and it was really neat we
        52:31
    learned a lot about the Seven clan systems there but Cherokee North Carolina is really weird has anybody
        52:36
    been to Cherokee North Carolina yeah it's weird right because they got this phenomenon they called chiefing you know
        52:43
    I mean it was a really impoverished community back in the day and in order to get money they had to they wanted
        52:49
    tourists to come and the tourists didn't want to come see Cherokees as we were historically right they wanted to see
        52:54
    teepees they wanted to see headdresses and for that reason the Cherokees from that area just started performing that
        53:01
    and so now he could go into Cherokee North Carolina it's like it's weird Simon Locker and this weird
        53:07
    Disney feel but to the credit of the Eastern Band they're working hard now to combat that working very hard to combat
        53:13
    that imagery and and sort of phase that out but I was gonna ask Mila what's your
        53:19
    what was your favorite part about the O'Connell oofta village but one thing
        53:32
    well so things um there was a blowgun
        53:50
    and it was really cool to learn about that that um every that the children
        53:59
    were the ones who would hunt and who would use the blowgun and they got so
        54:10
    they would practice and they got so good dad when they shot the blowgun they
        54:17
    would get like squirrels and birds and like rabbits and almost every time they
        54:24
    could shoot the animal in the eye that
        54:31
    impressed Mila oh and then the sign just popped up good dude that was the mother
        54:37
    town right there near Cherokee North Carolina the mother town of the Cherokee and the Cherokee Nation or the Eastern
        54:45
    Band just finally got that land back so we got to visit there I think it's called GU dua and Cherokees used to call
        54:50
    themselves the odd he could do people love could do a from there we reconnected then with Blythe ferry back
        54:57
    on the trail now Blythe Ferry is very interesting here's some images of it you
        55:04
    can follow the trail of tears now because the National Park Service has established his National Historic Trail
        55:09
    but the first place in reestablishing that trail was Blythe Ferry right here
        55:15
    and the reason it became so important is be because two-thirds of all Cherokees on the Trail of Tears came through this
        55:22
    very this is where they crossed the Tennessee River and it's probably the most comprehensive and the most
        55:29
    beautiful memorial we saw on the whole way and I think what was most intense
        55:36
    about this is at this memorial they used specifically the vocabulary of ethnic
        55:41
    cleansing that's what they said the Trail of Tears was was ethnic cleansing and I think this was probably the most
        55:59
    impressive memorial that we saw this whole time but there was actually two spots here and this is where they they
        56:06
    held the Cherokees at and then they had to cross the Tennessee River and it
        56:11
    might take four days to get that group of 800 Cherokees across that river so
        56:16
    then you had camps on on both sides of it so that's another thing that these
        56:21
    Cherokees went through yeah it was it was a tough tough life and our direct
        56:27
    ancestors when they left in 1832 they took the water out so they would have taken the Tennessee River sort of move
        56:33
    through some of this let's see we I so this is where my powerpoint presentation was kind of difficult that's a
        56:49
    I think a good file left I wonder quickly I'm gonna play a
        56:54
    montage for you okay this is the it's a four-minute musical montage that I'm
        57:00
    that we made for Milla's classroom talk so this is this is kind of a meal eccentric can I get there a meal
        57:07
    eccentric montage
        57:16
    the song is Cherokee morning song by Rita Coolidge and Robbie Robertson
        57:25
    and you'll see why this is Mila centric here in a minute you gotta understand pickles is adored in Milla's class
        57:37

        1:01:46
    [Music]
        1:02:09
    so this was a an incredible journey what happened is is it when we stopped every
        1:02:17
    time you stopped we would pick up another little piece of the the puzzle so start putting this thing together and
        1:02:22
    getting a picture of what our ancestors went through I can say it was tough we
        1:02:30
    learned so much about one of the things we learned I thought that was amazing his way the Cherokee the status of women
        1:02:38
    in the Cherokee Nation was actually very high much more so than than what modern
        1:02:48
    America is it's just it was crazy Nancy
        1:02:53
    Ward the last beloved woman of the Cherokee the beloved woman's Cherokee
        1:03:00
    has the power to veto the Chiefs decision that's pretty cool so we
        1:03:10
    learned that about just and then we learned about the the seven clans which
        1:03:15
    was really interesting and the clans passed through the mother not the father it passes through the mother so it that
        1:03:23
    was that was really interesting mm-hmm yeah and that said that when before the
        1:03:30
    removal when the Cherokees in the Europeans would try to negotiate treaties and the Cherokees would show up
        1:03:35
    they said where's your women and in response the English called the
        1:03:41
    Cherokees described them as a petticoat government and so here we are at the end
        1:03:48
    of the trail we arrived in Tahlequah Oklahoma and we were out looking for my great-great great-great grandmother's
        1:03:54
    grave and we yeah here let me play this
        1:04:01
    video for you real quick it's a short one so we were out driving near Stilwell
        1:04:07
    Oklahoma looking for my great-great great-great
        1:04:12
    grandmother's grave Elizabeth Terrell wha-what and we happened to stumble
        1:04:20
    across signs indicating this was the the end of the trail there's the back of the
        1:04:28
    sign we followed those signs and it brought us here
        1:04:33
    there's Stilwell Cemetery which was decided this is Webre slant ation seven
        1:04:43
    disbandment depose the Treaty of New
        1:04:50
    Echota promised when years subsistence provisions to be distributed at these
        1:04:56
    Depot's and the Cherokee Nation crazy
        1:05:29
    really feels like our ancestors pulled us to this spot even know about it
        1:05:40
    except we stumbled upon it by looking for Elizabeth
        1:05:46
    Terrell's great yeah it's done if you
        1:05:53
    were my dad that had been raining all day and as soon as we get there literally the sky opened up and the Sun
        1:05:59
    came out and it just felt like an intense moment of holiness and what I
        1:06:07
    said to my dad was like man we needed this and we didn't even know it it provided the the absolute total closure
        1:06:14
    to the trip the last full day of our trip mm-hmm that we were out on the
        1:06:19
    trail anything else to add to the description of the trip before I just say a couple of extra things here about
        1:06:25
    the good critical theory stuff that is me all those you know the there's some
        1:06:34
    parts up here the trip was two weeks and it was it was incredibly intense so there's a lot more of it we're not gonna
        1:06:41
    have you stay here for the whole thing but it was uh it was incredible we we
        1:06:48
    camped most of the way the logistics of the things we all flew into Atlanta and I'd reserved a hotel room there they
        1:06:55
    flew in separately we all flew in separately rented a car the next day went to Walmart bought camping equipment
        1:07:01
    we used that camping equipment throughout the thing Saul had set the
        1:07:06
    agenda he said okay this is where I want to go and it was my job to find the places so we had all the reservations
        1:07:12
    made and everything so we went around and and we did that and then right after this the day that we left we took that
        1:07:18
    camping equipment we went into Tulsa or where we were gonna catch planes out and
        1:07:23
    we donated it to Goodwill and then that was that but it was incredibly intense
        1:07:30
    trip and I know you're gonna talk more about that some other things but if you ever get a chance to do something like
        1:07:36
    this with your kids do it do it do whatever you can to get there and do it
        1:07:44
    there was all there are kinds of obstacles that we ran into planning this thing but we we knew that we were gonna
        1:07:51
    do it we committed to it and I was really worried I was worried because I had such high expectations of the trip I
        1:07:57
    kept wanting to bring that down I said no I you know cuz I'll be disappointed it so far exceeded all of my
        1:08:05
    expectations in every way it was just an incredible trip and I I hope for you
        1:08:12
    that you get a chance to do something like that with your with your family
        1:08:19
    when we were on the trip we went to like a little pond I think Springs oh yeah
        1:08:27
    and we saw a Crawdaddy and I need to lil
        1:08:33
    daddy cuz he was like orange and white and black and he was like a really tiny
        1:08:42
    crawdad but so so called crawdad I need a little daddies and when
        1:08:51
    you said that they gave them like a hundred and sixty acres right of land um
        1:08:57
    sometimes they would give them like 160 acres in one place and then 160 acres
        1:09:05
    and then the Hat like half of that in
        1:09:11
    one place and then the other half um like 200 miles away mm-hmm yeah that's
        1:09:20
    good that's your good history and they would take the hundred sixty acres split it in half put one portion here one portion over there they can't travel to
        1:09:27
    the other portion so squatters would get on it and that was another way of taking the land yeah excellent we rode every
        1:09:34
    kind of Road we walked every kind of path it was it was pretty pretty intense oh yeah
        1:09:41
    we were on the trail um there was we
        1:09:47
    were at a museum I think and a guy told us to go to this little spot Cemetery
        1:09:53
    and there was this little wooden trail we actually got to walk and we got to
        1:09:59
    explore the Ragan the wagon rut you could actually see wagon ruts in the
        1:10:05
    ground from where the wagons had been on the Trail of Tears it wasn't marked or
        1:10:12
    anything it was just like in the forest
        1:10:17
    and you go in there and you could just see like deep ragged wagon ruts and they
        1:10:25
    traveled there and it wasn't marked and there was nothing going on there or
        1:10:31
    anything and it was really cool intense or yeah I'll save that story for later
        1:10:37
    that's a great story thank you being that so yeah just to sort of contextualize this then in terms of that
        1:10:44
    cosmopolitan aspect you know Ishmael and I and we'll Geiger actually have been
        1:10:49
    talking in conversation about indigenous cosmopolitanism thinking about you know well the P the the natives of
        1:10:55
    southeastern United States had extensive trade networks that went all the way up to the the Great Lakes Kevin Jones is
        1:11:02
    here they use they use the mobility and trade language and Kevin bought me a book on the mobility and trade language
        1:11:09
    we're gonna try to revitalize that just like their extensive trade networks all
        1:11:14
    across the Raven buyer region down into California and you know you think about
        1:11:20
    that well one of the things that Ishmael and I sort of think about a lot is joy
        1:11:27
    Harjo has this notion of the English language as a trade language and so we think about what it is to translate
        1:11:33
    experiences between descendants of perpetrators and victims of colonialism
        1:11:39
    and what it means to translate that experience so that the experiences of
        1:11:44
    the descendants of victims can be legible to the consciousness of the
        1:11:50
    descendants of victims but there's four key things and I'll just do this quickly that really stand
        1:11:57
    out to me thinking about taking this journey and living here on finga Donnie and the first is historical violence I
        1:12:06
    think I say this frequently and I think people need to really take it seriously
        1:12:12
    michel foucault makes the argument that the state is not born with a cessation
        1:12:17
    of war right it's not like you know this is Hobbes kind of thinking right that the
        1:12:22
    state of nature is a state of war of all against all and you bring that to an end and then you form this state Foucault
        1:12:28
    points out no in fact the state is codified in the mud and blood of war the state is codified warfare that presents
        1:12:35
    itself with a thin veneer of peace but you look at the whole history of federal Indian law right and this is nothing but
        1:12:41
    codified warfare and I think we need to take that very seriously when we think
        1:12:47
    about social justice and thinking about restorative justice and healing and aspect to that too is the genealogies of
        1:12:54
    violence as we're taking our trip it's hard not to think about Trump's America
        1:13:00
    right now I mean you know rounding up people separating mother and children putting them into concentration camps
        1:13:06
    and then shipping them out right the genealogy there's a direct genealogical
        1:13:12
    connection I would say between the violence of the trailer tears and the violence of trumps America which is really best signified by the fact that
        1:13:19
    trauma takes office and puts Andrew Jackson's portrait up in his in his office also thinking about the fact that
        1:13:25
    last Saturday was the hundred and thirty seventh anniversary of the 1882 bombing of Angoon right we sort of think about
        1:13:32
    the indelible imprint of historical violence the second feature is memory
        1:13:38
    memory and counter memory memorials are wonderful things the blithe Airy memorial was really incredible but some
        1:13:44
    memorials can smuggle within them counter memory and we saw this with the Hiwassee River Heritage Center and I
        1:13:50
    think we see a lot of that here on finga Donnie teaching at the outter customer seminar this summer in Sitka I got to go
        1:13:56
    to the totem park and talk with a lot all the artists and sometimes we would just sit there by ourselves and just
        1:14:01
    laugh at the ridiculous things that you know non-native tourists come in and ask and
        1:14:07
    say and you know it's because there's no memory Walter Benjamin said that even
        1:14:13
    the dead will not be safe if the enemy wins and the enemy has not ceased to be
        1:14:18
    victorious and so I think that this is a key aspect of it of a journey like this
        1:14:24
    is seeking out the oral histories think seeking out the oral literary traditions
        1:14:30
    and and in encountering the landscape that memorizes that grief and we talked
        1:14:38
    a lot about to the psyche Gastineau right which is was built on a clinker
        1:14:44
    burial ground and we think about the 1962 burning of the Douglas Indian village you know that
        1:14:50
    just people of this community don't know it's like you know my dad's lifetime and that memory isn't carried the third one
        1:14:57
    so historical violence memory sovereignty is the third one Oklahoma
        1:15:02
    governor is actually a citizen the Cherokee Nation this is absolutely crazy he's trying to renegotiate tribal
        1:15:08
    casinos to help the Oklahoma economy
        1:15:14
    which hasn't raised its taxes like since the early 1990s right they got a crumbling infrastructure that the same
        1:15:20
    thing happened in Oklahoma happened in Kansas and is happening here in Alaska right now but also thinking about you
        1:15:26
    know fake Cherokees thinking about Elizabeth Warren thinking about the fact that a man presented himself as Cherokee
        1:15:32
    and got a 300 million dollar contract last year you know so thinking about sovereignty in those relationships and I
        1:15:39
    really appreciated Central Council President Richard Peterson's op-ed a couple weeks ago regarding the push to
        1:15:46
    exempt the Tongass National Forest from the roadless rule saying you have to you have to listen to the tribes on this one
        1:15:52
    so sovereignty is key and then finally the fourth one would be repair across
        1:15:58
    generations you know recede here on finga Donny we see transgenerational healing we see it
        1:16:06
    and our own family and really sort of being very proud of the language being
        1:16:13
    proud of the culture not experiencing the shame and his Ishmael said in his
        1:16:18
    introductions - just just to own that don't divide yourself in that regard so
        1:16:27
    yeah me that how do you say ganache sheesh and Cherokee
        1:16:36
    Wado how do you say - yay cost 13 and Cherokee donut I'll go hottie
        1:16:42
    yeah didn't even need English did we so that's our talk and love to have
        1:16:48
    questions and discussion if you are [Applause]
        1:16:59
    please raise your hands up so I can see
        1:17:07
    right on I'm not gonna talk much but just good if she shook huh that was
        1:17:12
    awesome and as I was maybe sitting here in your close proximity I you know I think about
        1:17:19
    a lot of I don't I'm not gonna presume I don't know much about Cherokee ways um
        1:17:24
    but I thought about the non-verbal you know your emotional life but also just
        1:17:31
    your presence so just having gone through that experience what are some of
        1:17:37
    the the you know are there parts of the
        1:17:42
    nonverbal experience that you can
        1:17:48
    verbalize you can talk about yeah one of my favorite Cherokees stories in like my
        1:17:54
    dad said God we got so much footage here it's it's a toad by Freeman Al and it's called people singing in the earth I
        1:18:01
    think you've heard me really this story before and I don't really have time to
        1:18:06
    tell it all but it's you know it's about a man who was brought to a mountain that
        1:18:14
    opened up and it was springtime in there and people were happy in there and he'd
        1:18:19
    come with a group of Cherokees who were invited to go into this mountain but he was so fascinated by it he's stopped he
        1:18:26
    turned around he ran back to his village to get his family and he brought them back and by that time they had closed and they thought he was crazy they went
        1:18:32
    back to the village and said he sat there and he sat there seven days and he just listened and listened and listened
        1:18:38
    and he was so still that he could hear the people singing in the earth and I love that phenomenological
        1:18:46
    phenomenologically being on these places being in forecasts hitting along the Hiwassee River
        1:18:52
    there's no memorial but if you sit there steel enough and you sit there long enough and and often enough like you can
        1:18:59
    hear people singing in the earth and you know where that hit me that most was totem Park this summer cuz through all the stress of the budget
        1:19:06
    stuff going on this summer that's where I would go take refuge I would just sit there for just like two hours and sit
        1:19:12
    there the banks of the Kosta Hien and just be quiet and and I think you can feel it I
        1:19:17
    think that's the nonverbal the you you can you can discern that but you have to have that modality of consciousness
        1:19:23
    that's capable of of hearing it right but yeah did you want to yeah the area
        1:19:29
    that Mila was talking about that the Park Service had just bought and there
        1:19:35
    were actual wagon ruts in the ground where the wagons for the Trail of Tears
        1:19:43
    carried the supplies had gone through and worn out and they they had to keep moving it so they had four of them
        1:19:49
    because the weather was so bad it was so hard when we got there it was just us we
        1:19:56
    went back in there in the woods and the
        1:20:01
    leaves had pretty much fallen and we're just back there with those wagon ruts you could feel it you know you could
        1:20:07
    feel those people haven't been through that area and it was a that was one of
        1:20:12
    the most emotional times of the trip for me and Saul did a beautiful video on it
        1:20:19
    that we're gonna put on a web site and guys can check it out later but it was amazing so that's the kind of thing I
        1:20:26
    think you're talking about that what you can feel so I just have a personal
        1:20:37
    question for you particularly for your father but you as well and and your
        1:20:43
    daughter um since you were cut off from this traditional history how has this
        1:20:52
    journey affected your sense of identity as an American in your sense of American
        1:20:58
    history and as a family that's a great question that's a great question it Saul
        1:21:05
    and I have been talking about this for a while and it's been changing but you know I had no idea what the Trail of
        1:21:12
    Tears was really like I mean my I'd heard there was a Cherokees that moved
        1:21:17
    from you know Georgia to Oklahoma so in a child's mind you know you've got these
        1:21:22
    bunch of people all gathered up and just walking Krauss you know that's not what it was so I I began to accept that my my
        1:21:37
    heritage I see when I was when I was
        1:21:44
    growing up it wasn't like that at all we were the Dawes Act the Dawes rolls
        1:21:53
    was a way of genocide for the Cherokees because once you start listing on there
        1:21:59
    and then the generations the the blood-quantum keeps dropping every generation right well pretty soon you
        1:22:07
    haven't got enough Cherokee and you to claim your Cherokee that's wrong and you
        1:22:13
    know that I mean it's that whole feeling of you know who you are as much the
        1:22:19
    Cherokees adopted people they made them Cherokees didn't have a drop of Cherokee
        1:22:25
    blood in you know didn't come but they adopted him so that's how it's changed
        1:22:30
    me I have totally embraced that part now yes I was asked to fill out a paperwork
        1:22:36
    and it said ethnicity Native American I hadn't done that you know we wouldn't do
        1:22:44
    that before because we felt bad about having so little actual blood that you felt
        1:22:54
    like you were taking away that from from full-blood Cherokees you know it's just
        1:23:01
    kind of a so that's why it was but yes now I tell you I've totally embraced it
        1:23:06
    and I just give that all to my son now there's a life changing experience and I
        1:23:14
    knew and I talked about the persistence just to see the horrors of what everybody went through to understand
        1:23:20
    like man that's persistence these people persisted they survived and it makes our
        1:23:28
    problems like not being able to fight froat fine froyo seem really small in
        1:23:33
    comparison and like when John Paul presents to get up on the counter and eat the pizza so I I had a question for
        1:23:49
    Saul I so a couple years ago I was reading the new translation of the
        1:23:55
    Odyssey which was totally easy to read and I started comparing it to some of the old ones I had read which were
        1:24:02
    really difficult to read because they were meant to be heard and so I'm
        1:24:08
    thinking about about what you've told us about your story that you do critical hermeneutics which is all about the text
        1:24:14
    and you gave us a presentation that was really about these impressions and about
        1:24:21
    the stories of your family so I'm wondering you know as much as this is this is a journey that has meant that
        1:24:26
    you would want us to hear about how has your time you know becoming Cherokee
        1:24:33
    affected your way of understanding as a scholar well thanks so you know I was I
        1:24:40
    was doing Native American Lit in grad school and I was also doing Jewish Studies in grad school and particularly
        1:24:48
    the work of Emanuel 11 oz renowned Jewish philosopher and Ishmael has
        1:24:54
    studied that in my class and I just remember the great conversation we had
        1:25:00
    in class one day when we worked through an eleven ounces tax and you know there
        1:25:05
    there's a from his Jewish sense of reading he always talked about a consciousness of hearing versus a
        1:25:11
    consciousness of seeing and that Western philosophical practices are dominated by a consciousness of seeing ever since
        1:25:19
    Plato kicked the storytellers out of his ideal city and from that moment on the Western literary imagination is an
        1:25:25
    impoverished imagination so I was really enamored with what Livanos was doing
        1:25:30
    with Jewish Studies talking about well how do you read with a consciousness of hearing similarly Toni Morrison says when I sit
        1:25:36
    down to read I listen when I sit down to write I listen then comes so you don't have honesty in the translation and keeping that oral
        1:25:43
    quality alive even within even within the the artifact of a book and I I think
        1:25:51
    what happened is my work with Ishmael over the years he's the one who brought
        1:25:57
    me back to the oral literary tradition of thinking about the world literary tradition constantly on which at rest
        1:26:02
    and so I think that's what's been particularly transformative about all of
        1:26:09
    this I think that that was all preparation for this like 10 years of living on finga Donnie was the
        1:26:14
    preparation for this so that people singing in the earth could be legible to
        1:26:20
    my consciousness and in a really somatically an embodied way and in fact this is interview that and indigenous
        1:26:29
    phenomenology and click 'add how screams it's coming out very soon it's will Geiger and Ishmael hope and and myself
        1:26:35
    you know we it's called within the within the whole body that's a line in the interview that
        1:26:41
    Ishmael said and really thinking about that radical sense of embodiment that
        1:26:47
    Western again the Western philosophical imagination hasn't had since Rene Descartes locked everything up is an
        1:26:52
    active rationality yeah I guess I've got
        1:27:01
    the microphone so I guess it's my turn yeah yeah I'm wondering if you could compare the the strength of the Cherokee
        1:27:12
    culture with a with the strength of the klinke cultures similarities differences
        1:27:18
    and also I was kind of wondering worthy if there's a core center of the Cherokee
        1:27:24
    Nation now and and also I don't think you mention anything about reservations
        1:27:30
    and I didn't know if the Cherokee people were put on reservations and I wanted to
        1:27:36
    know how the hell the nation is doing right now yeah maybe compare it a little bit with
        1:27:42
    this mm-hmm very strong Lincoln culture we have yeah yeah thanks so the
        1:27:49
    in 1984 the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Band got together three federally recognized Cherokee nation's
        1:27:55
    there's the Cherokee Nation which we're citizens of it's about 300,000 strong right now it's I think at this point
        1:28:01
    it's the largest and then there's the United Keetoowah Band which is also in
        1:28:08
    Tahlequah Oklahoma they're descendants of the old settlers and then there's the
        1:28:14
    Eastern Band in Cherokee North Carolina and at this point all three are really
        1:28:20
    revitalizing themselves in rich ways we have a new chief Chuck Hoskin jr. who's
        1:28:26
    doing amazing things just dropped like 30 million dollars on language revitalization they're building a whole
        1:28:31
    new center Mila and I get to take online language classes with IDI fields who's a Cherokee national treasure and we get he
        1:28:38
    doesn't see us but we get to see him we can communicate through the keyboard and so that's really powerful the first part
        1:28:45
    of your question is a very interesting one because a clink it friend of mine in
        1:28:50
    this community once he was talking about the difference when sake linkit and Ubik
        1:28:58
    or a new p AK did the clink it have a history of a little bit more assimilation well the Cherokee Nation
        1:29:05
    has a deep history of assimilation trying to assimilate to survive right I
        1:29:12
    mean doing everything that federal US federal government told us to do get a written language you know lose the
        1:29:21
    natural lineal social organization you know all of these things that we did and
        1:29:26
    we did and we did instill they violated treaties and they stole the land and in these kinds of things and so it's a it's
        1:29:33
    a really rough history of assimilation I think and so yeah yeah you know I don't
        1:29:42
    know I thinking about that's something I think that clink it oh and Cherokee Nation doesn't have we
        1:29:50
    don't have reservations Dawes Act destroyed you know all of that the
        1:29:57
    Eastern Band is a very interesting history because they ended up after the
        1:30:02
    Trail of Tears they were able to have a white man because the Cherokees weren't allowed to
        1:30:08
    own property they were allowed to buy lay back chunks of land put it in trust
        1:30:13
    with this white man once they collected enough land then he was able to get that
        1:30:20
    I give him give it back to them so they call it the Qualla boundary in Cherokee North Carolina you drive into Cherokee
        1:30:26
    North Carolina says welcome to the Cherokee reservation but it's not legally a reservation so there are no Cherokee reservations
        1:30:33
    it's the Cherokee Nation is 40 Northeast counties of Oklahoma how significant was
        1:30:44
    Sequoyah to preserving the Cherokee language and identity yeah very
        1:30:52
    important and they called him the talking leaves when he invented it that there's a whole interesting fascinating
        1:30:58
    history with that the way he taught the syllabary he was through the story form
        1:31:06
    so if you look at the original syllabary and how it was written out it actually tells the story and that's why people
        1:31:12
    learned it like that and he used his daughter Mila Mila was really fascinated about this a Koi his daughter became
        1:31:17
    central and showing everybody like look how easy this is to learn and it caught
        1:31:22
    on because it was foundationally pedagogical and so I was able to preserve that we have a guy named now
        1:31:28
    and guy now named William Durban who's doing the same kind of work and everybody compares him considers him a
        1:31:33
    modern-day Sequoia for all of the work he's doing language preservation and revitalization so yeah yeah couldn't
        1:31:43
    write he didn't know written language mm-hmm and he developed this I mean and I don't
        1:31:50
    think he had that much schooling or anything right so it was amazing individual Oh Mila does a story and his wife burned
        1:31:59
    all of his paperwork twice so fanatic
        1:32:05
    about it yeah thanks
        1:32:20
    since folks are having questions on Cherokee culture you don't mind out Cherokee stories at the Turtle Island
        1:32:26
    liar's club is a heck of a book cuz it's modern elders and it's just in their
        1:32:33
    words and Sequoyah guess who really sadly just pass was one of the master
        1:32:41
    storytellers of a world and that's the thing I pay attention to when it comes to oral indigenous storytellers and so
        1:32:49
    question earlier about compare you know cultural strength or anything like that like there's master storytellers amazing
        1:32:56
    master storytellers around today yeah that's right thank you
        1:33:07
    it's it's 8:30 said Dan all right well thank you all
        1:33:12
    for attending [Applause]
        1:33:33
    [Music]
        1:33:42
    cool hey [Music]
