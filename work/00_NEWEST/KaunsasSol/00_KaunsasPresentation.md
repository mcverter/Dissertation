Phenomenal, non?
I don't know what it means. 
I recognize only the names given to relations with others: Sol Neely,  Allensberg, Washington, and the concrete locality of Lingít Aaní, Tlingít ancestral land, where Sol Taught at University of Alaska Southeast (UAS), what thTlingit/Inupiaq writer Ishmael Angaluuk Hope calls the "Raven Creator Bioregion"

The sound of Sol's speech begins with the regard of an other person, the smiling face of his friend to say "me voici"


We tricksters have to honor each other so I give this talk in honor of Sol Neely 

We must hear the speaking of Sol Neely again, allow us to inspire us, listen to his recurrent cry to hear Levinas translated 
n a 2016 paper, Sol Neely, our great friend, asked us to allow the writings of Emmanuel Levinas to become inspired by indigenous thought so that we could learn to take ethical responsibility through "the social relation—the irreducible kinship relation expressed by 'all my relations' — the utterance itself of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard through an inspired eco-phenomenology."1. The question of our ethical relationship to nature seems especially pertinent now, both for us right here right now at this conference where we are considering the relationship between humanism and otherness, and for us as humans responsible for the exploitation and decimation of the natural world.

# Faceless Levinas

![Faceless Levinas](FacelessLevinas.jpg "Faceless Levinas")



We will begin with the anarchy of a faceless Levinas, considering what Levinas means by the "face of the earth" in Totaltiy and Infinity the depht and gravity of materiality, of motherhood in Otherwise than Being. 


I dare Levinas scholars to become iconoclasts, like Abraham, to smash the idol of the face

* “Does X have a face” is always the wrong question
Straightforwardly ontological, predicative
Reification of the face as a thing
Face is idolatry. You never look at the face of God

The problem begins in the book of Exodus, when the prophet Moses, speaking with God on Mount Sinai, asks God to show Moses his glory. God warns that: "…You cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live." (Exodus 33:20, NIV) 
The face isn't a thing. The mistake of reification, predication, ontological attribution is all over the scholarship. "The Face" is a mode of relating, one that is fundamentally ambiguous as you point out. This is an obvious truth: I see everything Gad presents as himself, as his Face, on his Facebook for example as a mode of self-presentation, but is that presentation of Face really who Gad is? Yes and no. The Face is a fundamentally ambiguous presentation. Moreover, "le visage" is a sort of a metonym for "intentionality" in general and sort of a wordplay on vision, vis-a-vis, videre (to see). It's an inquiry into the positionality of the one who sees, the one who looks, an inquiry into the position of the masculine, virile Subject. The face-to-face is a reconsideration of Hegel's struggle between self-consciousnesses, but this absolutely not the only nor the most important dynamic in Levinas. It's his undermining of all that macho bullshit of virile subjectivity. In his later works, he makes it more clear that the face is not the most important concept.
Really: worship of the Face in Levinas is flat out idolatry
I haven't read this article and I probably won't any time soon. In general, the idea of the "Face" is widely misunderstood. You get scholars asking dumb questions like "What is the face" and "Does X have a face". This is very clearly an ontological question, one of predicaton, of the Being of Face. Clearly the wrong question, reifying question.

In Sol's paper, he refers to a discussion 
“Le Visage” = Intentionality
Vision
Visuality
Intentionality The Subject Position
Man-to-Man position
Persectivism in Levinas the visage is not the only important viewpoint
“Le visage” is a straightforward wordplay, well-known philosophical trops
Vis a vis, vision
Intentionality of the seer, the power of theoria, of consciousness to subsume the external as internal
A seer is a subject, a masculine and virile subjectivity
The face-to-face is a man-to-man faceoff, a reconsideration of Hegel’s struggle for self-consciousness




Iconoclasm Anarchic, Faceless Levinas
In his later work, Levinas stops using the language of the face
Prevents the ontological error of thinking the face is a thing
His work foregrounds the depths from which subjectivity is given birth by maternity
Faceless becoming
