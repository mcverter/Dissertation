Phenomenal, non?  
I don't know what it means.
 
I recognize only the names given to relations with others: Sol Neely,  Allensberg, Washington, and the concrete locality of Lingít Aaní, Tlingít ancestral land (the word “lingít” means “human”), where Sol Taught at University of Alaska Southeast (UAS), the "Raven Creator Bioregion", a term coined by the father of Tlingit/Inupiaq writer Ishmael Angaluuk Hope, named for the Raven trcikster whose stories narrate the transformations of the land

The sound of Sol's speech in the video begins with the smiling face of his friend Wim Laven listening to him, regarding him, awaiting his revelation, his "me voici".  We still have much to hear in the teaching of Sol Neely.

In a 2016 paper, our great friend, whom Eric Garrett describes as a father, a husband, a son, a teacher, an activist, and a great Levinas scholar, Sol Neely asked us to allow the writings of Emmanuel Levinas to  become inspired by indigenous thought so that we could learn to take ethical responsibility by becoming attuned to "the utterance itself of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard through an inspired eco-phenomenology."  

He learned to become human in Linglit 'Aani where he took responsibity as a professor at University of Alaska Southeast and at The Flying University at The Lemon Creek Correctional Facility, learning from those around him that becoming human entailed becoming responsible in a rich kinship of human and other-than-human relations. 

The question of how we relate to nature and how we will liberate all beings seems especially pertinent right now, both for us right here right now at this conference where we are considering the relationship between humanism and otherness, and for us as humans responsible for abolishing the carceral state and the exploitation and decimation of the natural world and ending the carceral state.  

In his paper, Sol explains that several eco-phenonenologist have accused Levinas of setting up human beings at the top of a heirarchy among species based on an interview with Levinas, in which he is asked, “Does a snake have a face?” And he responds, “I don’t know if a snake has a face. I can’t answer that question.”  Sol responds to these objections by explaining that, instead of endorsing domination, Levinas is simply admitting that animals and nature in general experiences revelation and inspiration in a different way than we do.  His has no sovereign sovereign power to know the interiority of other beings. 

I would add my own notes to this.  
First of all, the uproar over a being "not having a face" indicates a wider misunderstanding of how negativity functions in the work of Levinas. From the very start of his publications,  he indicates that negation is essential to otherness. As he states even already in his doctoral thesis, he states "the existence  of material things contains in itself a nothingness, à possibility of not-being." The me who is here now before you is not the same person as the person who was there in the past or the person who will be in the future.  Because beings become within duration, they alter themselves, becoming what they are not, transforming from self to other to self and other to self to other.
> A multiplicity of sentients would be the very mode in which a becoming is possible-a becoming in which thought would not simply find again, now in movement, a being subject to a universal law, producing unity. Only in this way does becoming acquire the value of an idea radically opposed to the idea of being, does it designate the resistance to every integration expressed by the image of the river, in which, according to Heraclitus, one does not bathe twice, and according to Cratylus, not even once. A notion of becoming destructive of Parmenidean monism is acquired only through the singularity of sensation. (Totality and Infinity, page ____)
In Totality and Infinity, Levinas explains that Plato therefore had to "commit a parricide on his father Parmenides", a reference to when the Eleatic Stranger pleads:
> I have a yet more urgent request to make. Promise not to regard me as a parricide. Because, in self-defence, I must test the philosophy of my father Parmenides, and try to prove by main force, that in a certain sense not-being is, and that being, on the other hand, is not. ( Sophist, 241d)
Futhermore, Levinas's explicit usage of the term "parricide" and deliberate [clarification] with the word "father" indicates that the entire text of Otherwise than Being is in a sense, a further exploration described of his discussion of the metaphors of murder to describe the sacrifice of the paternity of the present to father the futurity of the son: "murder, rather than being one of the occasions of dying, were inseparable from the essence of death, as though the approach of death remained one of the modalities of the relation with the Other" 

# Faceless Levinas

![Faceless Levinas](images/FacelessLevinas.jpg "Faceless Levinas")

But even more troublesome than its misunderstanding of the negative in Levinas, the question betrays a profound misconception of Levinas's term *le visage*.  * “Does X have a face” is always the wrong question.  It is straigtforwardly an ontological question, one of predicaton, a reifying question, of the Being of Face, of its *quiddity*.  The worship of the Face is idolatry
> And He said, "You will not be able to see My face, for man shall not see Me and live. (Exodus 33:20)
>כוַיֹּ֕אמֶר לֹ֥א תוּכַ֖ל לִרְאֹ֣ת אֶת־פָּנָ֑י כִּ֛י לֹֽא־יִרְאַ֥נִי הָֽאָדָ֖ם וָחָֽי:
I challenge Levinas scholars to themselves become iconoclasts, like Abraham, to smash the idol of the face and to put an end to its worship.

For Levinas, *le visage* functions as a metaphor for intentionality.  In his doctor d'etat, he explains, that for Husserl's intentionality 
> In fact, all the forms of our life, affective, practical, and aesthetic, are characterized by a relation to an object. ... Our gaze is directed like a ray from the pure ego to the object correlated to the relevant state of consciousness (thing, state of things, etc. ) and achieves the consciousness of this object which may be very different from case to case.” (Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology)
The one who has a visage is one who sees, whose present stance postions the world outside vis-a-vis his vision to his masculine, virile subjectivity, consuming its externality as his own internal state of consciousness. The "face-to-face" of Levinas is a man-to-man faceoff, a reconsideration of Hegel's discussion of the Independence and Dependence of Self-Consciousness:
(Phenomenology of Spirit 178-188).  
It would wrong to consider this face-to-face relationship between two adult males as the goal of one’s ethical development.  Although Levinas only employs the term “ethical” in certain sections of his texts, each moment of his genealogy opens up a new perspective, a different ethical orientation towards the Other, a different hyperbolic Riemann curvature of intersubjective space.  Although the face and the face-to-face are important metaphorics in Totality and Infinity, Levinas stops using them in his later work, partially to prevent the ontological error of considering the face to be a thing and to foreground the ethical depths from which subjectivity is given birth by maternity


### *La face* is not *le visage* 
![Al Lingis farewell at the Baltimore Travel Plaza](../../al.jpg "Al Lingis farewell at the Baltimore Travel Plaza")


But Levinas does use the word "la face" in Totality and Infinity but in a way that is way that has been profoundly betrayed in its English translation.  I visited World traveler, philosopher, translator, and fellow trickster Alphonso Lingis at the Baltimore Travel Plaza with my bestest pal Shorty The Dog -- to he i am for evva true -- in Baltimore in 2006 while hounding and hitchhiking to the NALS conference at Purdue. I love that crazy fool and his pet peacocks but I need to call him out on this error.

Levinas uses the word "face" not to refer to the human visage but rather to the side of the element:
In TI (find the section), Levinas states
> It unfolds in its own dimension: depth, which is inconvertible into the breadth and length in which the side of the element extends. To be sure, a thing likewise presents itself by but one unique side; but we can circle round it, and the reverse is equivalent to the obverse; all the points of view are equivalent. The depth of the element prolongs it till it is lost in the earth and in the heavens. “Nothing ends, nothing begins.

> Il se déploie dans sa propre dimension la profondeur, inconvertible en largeur et en longueur où s'étend *la face de l'élément*. La chose, certes, elle non plus, ne s'offre que par une face unique; mais nous pouvons en faire le tour, et l'envers en vaut l'endroit. Tous les points de vue se valent. La profondeur de l'élément le prolonge et le perd dans la terre et dans le ciel « Rien ne finit, rien ne commence. » (my italics, gote)

Lingis explains his regrettable choice choice:
> It is in order to reserve the English word ‘face’ to translate ‘visage’ — the countenance of the Other — that we are using the term ‘side’ to translate ‘face’ in this context.

*La face* in Levinas is in many ways the subversion of *le visage*, the materiality of maternity, the gravitational curvature of space-time, extending in the dimesnion of *depth* as opposed to the *height* of *le visage* 

### Elemental Quesion 

THe question of the element is a fundamental one for Levinas, from the very outset of his antifascist philosophical inquiry
In his 1990 preface to his 1935 article "Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism", Levinas explains:
> The article stems from the conviction that the source of the bloody barbarism of National Socialism lies not in some contingent anomaly within human reasoning, nor in some accidental ideological misunderstanding. This article expresses the conviction that this source stems from the essential possibility of *elemental Evil* into which we can be led by logic and against which Western philosophy had not sufficiently insured itself.
He begins the 1935 article:
> The philosophy of Hitler is primordial [primaire]. But the primitive powers that burn within it burst open its wretched phraseology under the pressure of an elementary force. They awaken the secret nostalgia within the German soul. Hitlerism is more than a contagion or a madness; it is an awakening of elementary feelings. 
> But from this point on, this frighteningly dangerous phenomenon becomes philosophically interesting. For these elementary feelings harbor a philosophy. They express a soul’s principal attitude towards the whole of reality and its own destiny. They predetermine or prefigure the meaning of the adventure that the soul will face in the world.
The elemental takes form as enchainement of the soul to the body:
> The importance attributed to this feeling for the body, with which the Western spirit has never wished to content itself, is at the basis of a new conception of man. The biological, with the notion of inevitability it entails, becomes more than an object of spiritual life. It becomes its heart. The mysterious urgings of the blood, the appeals of heredity and the past for which the body serves as an enigmatic vehicle, lose the character of being problems that are subject to a solution put forward by a sovereignly free Self. Not only does the Self bring in the unknown elements of these problems in order to resolve them; the Self is also constituted by these elements. Man’s essence no longer lies in freedom, but in a kind of bondage [enchaînement]. To be truly oneself does not mean taking flight once more above contingent events that always remain foreign to the Self’s freedom; on the contrary, it means becoming aware of the ineluctable original chain that is unique to our bodies, and above all accepting this chaining.
These philosophies of elemental force inevitably lead to war and conquest, a world of masters and slaves 
> But force is characterized by another type of propagation. The person who exerts force does not abandon it. Force does not disappear among those who submit to it. It is attached to the personality or society exerting it, enlarging that person or society while subordinating the rest. Here the universal order is not established as a consequence of ideological expansion; it is that very expansion that constitutes the unity of a world of masters and slaves. Nietzsche’s will to power, which modern Germany is rediscovering and glorifying, is not only a new ideal; it is an ideal that simultaneously brings with it its own form of universalization: war and conquest.


Levinas's task from the outset is therefore to conceive the becoming of beings within the flux of time that does not start with the assertion of force and conflict.  That is, Levinas's work is a subversion of not only Heidegger's thinking of Being but moreover as a perversion of Heraclitus's thinking of Becoming, whose dictum  Πάντα ῥεῖ[^1],  everything flows, is further elaborated by his assertion:
> War (polemos) is the master-father (pater) of all beings; and some he has made gods and some men, some slaves and some free
Levinas opens up Totality and Infinity renouncing the
> obscure fragments of Heraclitus { that } prove that being reveals itself as war to philosophical thought.[^3]   
While this is most likely a reference to Heidegger's embrace of Heraclitus, his belief that force and conflict are fundamental to the dynamic of becoming, to the flow of change over time has been widely influential: atomism, materialism, Spinoza, Hume, Locke, Hobbes, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Deleuze, Foucault, Bradiotti, deep ecology, ecophenomenology, anarchoprimitivism and many others inherit this basic understanding from Heraclitus. 

### Continuous Creation

In order to think otherwise than war and conquest, Levinas conceives of Becoming as continuous creation, as the generation and regeneration of gendered generations.  His conception of continuous creation comes from numerous sources.  He makes clear and distinct references to "the discontinuity of Cartesian time, which requires a continuous creation," an understanding that comes from Descartes through Bergson: 
> Creation would have appeared not simply as continued, but also as  continuous. The universe, regarded as a whole, would really evolve. The future would no longer be determinable by the present.
This indeterminacy occurs in Levinas as the transsubstantiation between self and other through time.   

More interestingly, the idea of continuous creation is the theme in one of the Jewish morning prayers, a text taken from Psalm 104:30        
> When you send your breath/spirit, they are created,  and you renew the face of the earth 
>     לתְּשַׁלַּ֣ח ר֖וּֽחֲךָ יִבָּֽרֵא֑וּן וּ֜תְחַדֵּ֗שׁ פְּנֵ֣י אֲדָמָֽה:
Jewish liturgy already understands that inspiration and creation come through the face of the earth, PNAY ADAMAH
Levinas seemingly draws from this verse by conceiving creation as a being inspired, breathed-into, birthed through the matrix of maternity into a world of sensible materiality, where in nurses on the element. According to the coming-of-age narrative told through the sections of Totality and Infinity, this newborn grows up, marries a wife, moves into a house, gets a job, grows older, has sex, dies, and is reborn as a new subjectivity.  In Otherwise than Being, Levinas focuses instead on the ethical-phenomenogical relations of maternity and of being-born.
>The-one-for-another has the form of sensibility or  vulnerability, pure passivity or susceptibility, passive to the point of becoming an inspiration, that is, alterity in the same, the trope of the body animated by the soul, psyche in the form of a hand that gives even the bread taken from its own mouth. Here the psyche is the maternal body.

### Allomothering and Prison Maieutics
In her book "Maternal Thinking", Sarah Ruddick defines the maternal standpoint not as an instinctive disposition or a specifically gendered role but rather as a set of practices that preserves the life of the child, nourishes their growth, and prepares them for acceptance in the wider society.  The anthropologist Sarah Hrdy adds an additional dimension to this idea of maternal practice by explaining that  the evolutionary success of childrearing does not rest on the mother alone but rather on the community of caretakers around her, allomothers, persons other than the mother who are willing and capable of performing the tasks of childcare, and who will return the child intact to the mother once they are done with it.    Anthropologists have found that the person who has proven to be most reliable in performing this allomothering role is the grandmother who dedicates herself to keeping both the mother and the grandchild healthy and well-fell.

According to Sol's students at the Flying University, Sol could be understood as a maternal figure. Sol turned the Lemon Creek Correctional Facility into a *schul*, teaching them, enacting the practice of *maieutics*, acting as a midwife to aid in the birthing of their philosophical understanding.  His student Shawn Jessup explains ""The mother is our the house so to say, but the the grandmother is the pillars, the foundation. In a bigger picture, mother earth, who fits mother earth's grandmother.  ... But yes, if you quote levinas, then you must bring up sol. Think of it this way. Levinas was a "grandmother" Martin matustik was a "mother" and sol the "child" but also the "grandmother" to his students and so on."
![Sol Neely, Granarchist!](images/AllomotheringFlyingUniversity.PNG "Sol Neely, Granarchist").  Another student remarked that his father told him that his best days in prison were when 
> the days that people would come in and play Monopoly or checkers or have a book club or teach a class or have a religious service or those types of events because in those moments he encountered strange but those strangers would look him in the face and those strangers would look him and they would meet his gaze and he      said it made him feel human and so what I thought Saul was offering me was the opportunity to go and maybe try to make  some other people feel human that could use that in their lives"

### Singing in the earth (still working on this last section)

A relationship of maternity with the earth
> The supply of food and gift items was in the hands of the Gantowisas, which meant that they had explicit responsibility for rendering and maintaining the Iroquoian gift economy. This was a clear expression of the resonance between the gift giving Earth and gift giving women: just as the mound beds were regarded as the breasts of Mother Earth, the corn her milk, so the gifting of the Gantowisas was compared with breast-feeding. Gift giving was considered a motherly action from which all people drew their lives.5
> "Upon her death from carrying too many children, the Lynx was buried on Turtle Island, where she transformed into fertile Mother Earth, nourishing the people: corn, or “earth-milk,” grows from her breasts, squash from her navel, and beans from her feet. These are her daughters, the sacred Three Sisters"
> "The guiding image for the economy is Mother Earth herself, and as with earth, sharing and giving away out of an abundance are its supreme values. The gift is the lynchpin of the economy, patterned after the continuous gift giving of earth and sky."
> "Matriarchal gift giving supports the securing and maintenance of peace at all these levels." (Heidi Goettner Abendroth: Matriarchal Societies__)


ROBIN WALL KIMMERER:   "the grammar of animacy"
> "A bay is a noun only if water is dead. When bay is a noun, it is defined by humans, trapped between its shores and contained by the word. But the verb wiikwegamaa— to be a bay— releases the water from bondage and lets it live." .... So it is that in Potawatomi and most other indigenous languages, we use the same words to address the living world as we use for our family. Because they are our family. To whom does our language extend the grammar of animacy? Naturally, plants and animals are animate, but as I learn, I am discovering that the Potawatomi understanding of what it means to be animate diverges from the list of attributes of living beings we all learned in Biology 101. In Potawatomi 101, rocks are animate, as are mountains and water and fire and places. Beings that are imbued with spirit, our sacred medicines, our songs, drums, and even stories, are all animate. The list of the inanimate seems to be smaller, filled with objects that are made by people. Of an inanimate being, like a table, we say, “What is it?” And we answer Dopwen yewe. Table it is. But of apple, we must say, “Who is that being?” And reply Mshimin yawe. Apple that being is. Yawe— the animate to be. I am, you are, s/ he is. To speak of those possessed with life and spirit we must say yawe. 



SOL:
>    the seventh day he began to hear the singing deep within the earth and so he went back to the village and from that day forward he told the people in the village that if you're quiet enough long enough and if you sit and listen to the streams and really are aware and very quiet and still that you too can hear the people singing within the earth those happy ones that went on before ...  We must preserve the earth and we must value the lives of our elders in the lives of our children and save them a place to live if we don't then there will be a revelation for the people of today as  well as for all of the cherokee
