Phenomenal, non?
I don't know what it means. 
I recognize only the names given to relations with others:
* Sol Neely, 
* Alensberg Washington, 
* Alaska,
* Tinglit Aani, ( get this frm sol's paper desciption of this term) what "Tlingit/Inupiaq writer Ishmael Angaluuk Hope calls the "Raven Bioregion" 

The sound of Sol's speech begins with the regard of an other person, the smiling face of his friend  to say "me voici"



We tricksters have to honor each other so I give this talk in honor of Sol Neely 
allomothering, other than mother
in indigenous it's the house
in jewish, the schul, the learning center,
teaching as allomothering
