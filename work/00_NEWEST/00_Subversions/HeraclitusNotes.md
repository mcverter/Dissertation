Strife is justice

Dike depicted on the Vermont state house. Heraclitus considered strife fundamental to a just world.
Heraclitus said "strife is justice";[am] and "all things take place by strife".[an] He called the opposites in conflict ἔρις (eris), "strife", and theorized the apparently unitary state, δίκη (dikê), "justice", results in "the most beautiful harmony,"[an] in contrast to Anaximander who described the same as injustice.[26][37][38]

Aristotle said Heraclitus disliked Homer because Homer wished that strife would leave the world, which according to Heraclitus would destroy the world; "there would be no harmony without high and low notes, and no animals without male and female, which are opposites".[ao] It may also explain why he disliked Pythagoras, with the Pythagorean emphasis on harmony, but not on strife.[35]

Heraclitus suggests the world and its various parts is kept together through the tension produced by the unity of opposites, like the string of a bow or a lyre.[39][ap] On one account, this is the earliest use of the concept of force.[40] A quote about the bow shows his appreciation for wordplay: "The bow's name is life, but its work is death."[aq][note 5] Each substance contains its opposite, making for a continual circular exchange of generation and destruction, and motion, that results in the stability of the world.[41][42] This can be illustrated by the quote "Even the barley-drink separates if it is not stirred."[ar]

According to one author, "War is the central principle in Heraclitus' thought."[43] Another of Heraclitus' famous sayings highlights the idea that the unity of opposites is also a conflict of opposites: "War is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods, some as men; some he made slaves, some free;"[as] war is a creative tension that brings things into existence.[41][44] Heraclitus says further "Gods and men honour those slain in war,"[at] "Greater deaths gain greater portions."[au] and "Every beast is tended by blows."[av]


Classical
Plato
Plato is the most famous philosopher who tried to reconcile Heraclitus and Parmenides; through Plato, both of these figures influenced virtually all subsequent Western philosophy. Plato knew of the teachings of Heraclitus through his follower Cratylus.[72] Plato held that for Heraclitus knowledge is made impossible by the flux of sensible objects, and thus the need for the imperceptible Forms as objects of knowledge.[84][85]

Aristotle
Aristotle depreciated Heraclitus, accusing him of denying the law of noncontradiction, and thereby failing to reason.[u] However his material monist and world conflagration interpretation of Heraclitus also influenced the Stoics.[4][86]

Modern
Modern interest in early Greek philosophy can be traced back to 1573, when French printer Henri Estienne (also known as Henricus Stephanus) collected a number of Presocratic fragments, including those of Heraclitus, and published them in Latin in Poesis philosophica.[108] Renaissance skeptic Michel de Montaigne's essay On Democritus and Heraclitus, about weeping philosopher versus laughing philosopher, and which is better (Montaigne sides with laughing), was probably written soon after.[109] The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare features the melancholic character of Antonio, who some critics contend is supposed to be Heraclitus.[110] At another point of the same play, a woman named Portia assesses her potential suitors, and says of one County Palatine "I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old".[111]

According to Bernard Freyberg, "Both Parmenides and Heraclitus are direct if distant ancestors of Spinoza," since they both said all is one.[112] David Hume wrote while discussing personal identity: "Thus as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages."[113]

Since Kant philosophers have sometimes been divided into rationalists and empiricists.[114] As is typical, Heraclitus has been considered each by different scholars.[13] For rationalism,[115] one could cite fragments like "Poor witnesses for men are the eyes and ears of those who have barbarian souls."[bw] For empiricism,[20] one could cite fragments like "The things that can be seen, heard, and learned are what I prize the most."[bx] Gottlob Mayer argued the philosophical pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer recapitulated the thought of Heraclitus.[116]

The German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher was one of the first to collect the fragments of Heraclitus specifically and write them out in his native tongue, the "pioneer of Heraclitean studies".[117][118][119] Schleiermacher was also one of the first to posit Persian influence upon Heraclitus, a question taken up by succeeding scholars Friedrich Creuzer and August Gladisch.[101][119]

The influence of Heraclitus on German idealist G. W. F. Hegel was so profound that he remarked in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy: "there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my Logic."[120] Hegel interpreted Heraclitus as a dialetheist, and as a process philosopher, seeing the "becoming" in Heraclitus as a natural result of the ontology of "being" and "non-being" in Parmenides.[1] He also doubted the world-conflagaration interpretation popular since Aristotle.[1] The Young Hegelian and socialist Ferdinand Lassalle wrote a book on Heraclitus.[115] "Lassalle follows Hegel in styling the doctrine of Heraclitus "the philosophy of the logical law of the identity of contradictories."'[101] Lassalle also thought Persian theology influenced Heraclitus.[115][55][121] Marx called Lasalle's work "like a schoolboy"[122] and Lenin accused him of "sheer plagiarism".[121]

Classical philologist Jakob Bernays also wrote a work on Heraclitus.[101] Inspired by Bernays, the English scholar Ingram Bywater collected all the fragments of Heraclitus in a critical edition Heracliti Ephesii Reliquiae (1877).[123] An English translation was provided by G. T. W. Patrick in 1889.[13] Hermann Diels wrote "Bywater's book has come to be accounted...as the only reliable collection of the remains of that philosopher."[123] Diels published the first edition of the authoritative Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics) in 1903, later revised and expanded three times by Diels, and finally revised in two subsequent editions by Walther Kranz. Diels–Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers. In Diels–Kranz, each ancient personality and each passage is assigned a number to uniquely identify it; Heraclitus is traditionally catalogued as philosopher number 22.[124]

The existentialist and classical philologist Friedrich Nietzsche preferred Heraclitus above all the other pre-Socratics.[26][125] The nationalist philosopher of history Oswald Spengler wrote his (failed) dissertation on Heraclitus.[126] Existentialist and phenomenologist Martin Heidegger was also influenced by Heraclitus, as seen in his Introduction to Metaphysics. Heidegger believed that the thinking of Heraclitus and Parmenides was the origin of philosophy and misunderstood by Plato and Aristotle, leading all of Western philosophy astray.[127][67]

The Irish author Oscar Wilde was influenced by Heraclitus.[128] Wilde is credited with the saying "expect the unexpected", though Heraclitus said "If you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult."[129][by]

In the 1950s, a term originating with Heraclitus, "idios kosmos," meaning "private world" as distinguished from the "common world" (koinos kosmos) was adopted by phenomenological and existential psychologists, such as Ludwig Binswanger and Rollo May, to refer to the experience of people with delusions, or other problems, who have trouble seeing beyond the limits of their own minds, or who confuse this private world with shared reality.[130] It was an important part of novelist Philip K. Dick's views on schizophrenia.[131] The quote is: "The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own."[bz]

Socrates tells Theaetetus that he cannot make out what knowledge is, and is looking for a simple formula for it. Theaetetus says he really has no idea how to answer the question, and Socrates tells him that he is there to help. Socrates says he has modelled his career after his midwife mother. She delivered babies and for his part, Socrates can tell when a young man is in the throes of trying to give birth to a thought. Socrates considers his philosophical work as midwifery (Maieutics). This method, later also called Socratic method, consists in eliciting knowledge by a series of questions and answers.
