reborn life and death is circular
not linear thinking 
death is never an end


very important is the 

ancestors are not far away or are dead.  they are the other living part of the extended faily they live in the other world but they are lving . they speak to themas if they were still with them.  not a separation between the living and the dead.  the ancestors are always with them.  

women in this.  sacred not only as giving 
transform death into life again .  the idea of the rebirth  these ideas of life and death are big different from waht we are accustomed to 


mother earth .  thi idea of rebirth they observe that life is gven back by earth .  after winter.  so they thought that life diesappears in winter and then reapperars 

life is transformed and coming back again
continouous translfromation which mother earth shows

from the obersvation of the sky
as moon and sky are coming in the morning and from the eeast and the west they go down.  they disappear in an uncderwrold. they are reborn the moon and the sun.  the idea of th esky 

not a naive idea but from observation

fromnature they took this idea

giving birth vs male creator god

creating vs giving birth 


myth of origin of matriarchal pepole always a female being giving birth or creatrix that gives birth to earth

about birth and a loving act to give life to othr beings

patriarhcal.  god creates world by word because he can no t give birth.  he is a  maker not a birth giver.  a techne.  a distinct way to do things.  it's a world of peower  .  making things in his own image.  its an act of power not an act of love like mother 

the birth is not finished. it's part of the child raising.  the giving birth.  the nurturing and caring and looking for others.  it's a contnous process of birthing.  not reduced to other.  others are introduced.  not just biological mothers.  mothers can be mothering. it can be done by non mothers.  anyone who has this prosocial attitude to the others

children come from the ancestors
not from the biology of the father
brother of the mother is the same clan name as mother and her children.  closest relative
consequence of the mother line.

wanted to pass his riches to the son.  patriarchy.  power property. early patriarhy had to take single women out of the clans.  lock her in to monogomous fatherhood .  based on coercion and force 

power over women
maternal uncle as caring for the child

Diego Lopez : Iâ€™m struck by the difference between birthing creation, which makes us all semi divine by cosmic heritage vs. creator made or crafted life which makes us all hierarchically lower

not belief its a daily proactice. it's a fact.  daily experience of rebirth.  take it as a fact.
