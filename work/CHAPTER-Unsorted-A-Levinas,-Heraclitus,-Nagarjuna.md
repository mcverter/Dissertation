I’m not sure where this goes but I have to dedicate a chapter to discussing Levinas vs Heraclitus. In the foreword to Totality and Infinity Levinas makes his first reference to Heraclitus: “we do not need obscure fragments of Heraclitus to reveal to us that truth is determined by war”, also indicating Nietzsche (‘are we lied to by morality’), and Heidegger and one could extend this to Deleuze too.  The second reference to Heraclitus occurs while discussing the becoming-of-sensibility in terms of Cratylus, not Heraclitus “you can not step into the river even once”.  Here contrast Heraclitus/Heidegger with Being as a clash of forces against Levinas: temporality is an erotic continuous creation, the copula is produced through copulation.
