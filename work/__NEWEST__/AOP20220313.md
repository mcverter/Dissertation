Over the years, I have written many texts that outline an "Anarchism of the Other Person", an anarchafeminism read through the writings of Emmanuel Levinas and Petr Kropotkin. This task has long seemed urgent to me because it contrasts (but perhaps also complements) with contemporary anarchist writings informed by Nietzsche, Deleuze, Nietzschean, Stirner, Heidegger, etc. That is, anarchism is compelled by our continuous ethical orientation to other persons (even the other person who I am to myself over time), not by a Heraclitean flux of interpenetrating forces.

In this work I will explore several avenue to check upon the possibilities for discussing the work of Emmaneul Levinas as a philosopher of anarchism of the other person.

We will begin with a discussion of what is constituted by ethics for levinas.

A) What is ethics for Levinas?
Theories of Ethics are divided into a lot of different terms. For example, "normative" and "perscriptive" or "descriptive". Levinas as none of these but as a way in which our everyday lvies are shaped.

In order to understand this we must understand the sources of Levinas's project. From Husserl the understanding of the world as relating back to the subject's perception of the world. First Heidegger when he defines fundmanetal ontology as the way that one is not a passive member of the past or the passive present but takes on the heritage of the past as one's own (eigenlichtkeit) and understanding how the people are bound together that the existence of human being is fundamental to our being, that our existence is bound together with being at large.

Fundamental questions of temporality: in what way am I the same person over time? In what way does time connect unto itself? Locke quotation from the essays -- also Dmitri's paper let's hope. Time consciousnes sand how the each moment leads into the other.

The question of the Being of Becoming -- how do moments flow from one to the other? Is there an eternal substance beneath all everything and things that change are merely accidents of this time, a fourth dimenstional spacetime continuum a fourth dimensional prism? Is time like Becoming, like a river in Heraclitus. Our foundational ideas about Becoming of time. Everything flows. Everything is in flux. Panta Rhei. Levinas contrasts his idea of time from between the Cratylus and the Heraclitus, where one can not even place ones foot in the same river once?

What is it for Levinas htat is so disruptive of time and time consciousness, of our self identity , of existence itself that is so disruptive to temporality of becoming is our relationships with other people.

It is this "curvature of spacetime", the perspective in which one is related to other people, that is what Levinas means by ethics.

Ethics is a phenomenological and ontological term for Levinas

## Anarchy

What then does this have to do with anarchy?

That things have no stable foundation. That nothig is permanent or abiding or absolute. The Absolute state is a sham as is the Absolute Deity. Domination comes from this belief in absolutes.

To solve this problem of the abosoluteness of everything anarchists ahve recommended an approach instead of ontological anarchy. Realizign that everything is in flux and always changing. Max Cafard says. pull a quote here.

But is this the only way that things break up? That they are always subject to chaos? And if so it is chaos? What is the disrupting element, the swerve (clinamen) that affects the movement of particules to give time a sense of randomness? The warping of gravity is that which is affected by the other.

The modes of our world that in which we exist, that form the intermediary realm in and through which we wander, are shaped and warped and contorted and subverted, perverted, inverted, and reverted perspectives by the gravity of the other person within the spacetime continuum The discontinuity of one's own existence as the "I is an other" of Rimbaud always transforming. But also the structure of time, in that we inherit a whole bunch of stuff from other people through time. And also the structure of society, that at any tiem we relate to other people we ultimatley are in static set of social relations.

Social relations are an important thing for Marxism and HEegeliansm . But how is Leivnas different? These social relation in many readings of Marx and Hegel would take theis to form what levinas calls a totality, a whole picture in which everything that can be captured by a snapshot that can be mapped out as a set of inner relations of the parts that constitute the whole. For Levinas a continual refusal to attempt that type of summary and encapsulation, to catpure the entrelyt in a lateral view. The other person comes at you in a certain orientation a veriety one is always standing in relation to others. For this reason the always disrupts this ttality . The total picture is just a snapshot that obscures the dynamic within the picture itself. THat these things are always broken apart and in fact never were a single thing to begin with.

In this way, Levinas carries on with an idea that is in Hegel of separating moments of time into constitutents. A descriptive phenomonlogy of each moment of time. That each is disrupted by the other even before it can acheive self existence and that illustrating the inner structure of this relationship to singularity of the other person, the fact that the other person is an irreplaceableity of an individual and not merely an example of a certain type of person, and that within this dimesnion of our relationship with individuals is already the relatiosnhip with other persons -- that you have a smile on your face when i see you in the morning because the bodega clerk made coffee this morning.

That our everyday existence is already informed by our relationships with other persons is fundamentatl to understanding the fundamentally anarchistic mode of our everyday existence. that we are already responsible to the other person and that the other person can surprise us with an unanticipated response. We never have everything at our control. At best we are projecting or inspecting or we ahve a certain snapshot, a certain idea of a person but that person inhabits it with their own particular gravity. That person is a woman but she occupies that place of her womanhood in her own particular manner -- she dresses in her own particular way, different levels of emotional and mental and spirtiual engagement, relationship with her own bodilty capablities like that of becoming a mother and so on. And beyond this they are a past that we can never fully know and a future that surprises us. that even if we can predict the ultimate outcome in a perfect skinner box of determinism, that the way that the other person reaches that terminus, the path is unpredictable to us.

The problem of the pataphysical. The study of exceptions. In that every person throught erheir exisence is already an exception to the general rule, a new data point that must be incorporated to make the metric. Every other is an excpetion too

not "interconnected" by the intermediary sphere. we are connected through by linksages and within a globe. how do we analysie those? What is a medium? Medium is separation how are we linked and separated. It is this which is analszble. But we are nodes aupon this and looked more closely everything is a node

We are therfore resopnsible. In the sense that we are always responding to a relationship to other persons. Even our relationshpi to ourself is with another perosn. We are always in a reaction. the possiblity of our awareness is the possiblity of being affected by another person, in a way a passivility that already infomrs our every move. We are pulled by this gravity of the other person, it inclines us towards it, Like the Einstein used the example of gravity warping spacetime: place a ball in the middle of a sheet and the fabric around the ball bends in its direction. We are alrady inclined in their direction and in this sense already obligated towards them.

This obligation is not a domination but a freedom. The characteristic view of authoritarian thought is that other people threaten our own existenc. That what informs our relatinships with other people are along the axis of power -- or of Desire, which Baudrillard points out is a synonym for power (Baudrillard). Or that Hannah Arendt figues that is our relationship with the body. That it is a domantion of our freedom. That we must escapte th yoke of others to realizce our freedom. Sartre Hell is Other People that would find the existence of each of the three persons of Huis Clos the implinging of one on the other.

But maybe instead the obligations towards other people are our sources of freedom as well. They are what allow us to do anything really. Why get up but to see a freind to have a chat, to watch a tv show with people in it, to eat oatmeal that other people have farmed that other people have grown that other people have boxed that other people. Even if one were to declare oneself a hermit and to go into nature by oneself, one has no pathway to nature but through other people, even if only physically by following their maps and their roads.

## Economy and Ecology

Levinas approaches Becoming in a weird way. He starts from Hebrew scripture as the mythopoetic that is perhaps problematic as many feminist scholars have objected. Problematic from Foucault and Canguielm as the core motivating thing that is driving the entire discussion. However, this is not only problematic for Levinas, but it is his problematic. As Derrida says "perhaps the question s that we are asking levinas are the ones he is asking to us"

This quesitoning will take the form of raising the mythopoesis of the Hebraic scripture, a history of patriarchs and matriarchs.

Being and becoming occurs not as a flux of anonymous forces, of panta rhei, of all things arising from polemos, the conflict of opposites. But instead as the generation of gendered generations, of relationships constituted as relatives, of kinspersons and foreigners.

Thus Levinas explores through a series of analytic structures that have been questioned: family members (mothers, fathers, daughters, orphans, widows, sisters, an infertile woman -- this is the witches in macbeth, son of life), as well as a deeply ambiguous employment of gender binaries.

Problematic gender binaries maybe. Talk about sociobiology to get a better understanding of what it might mean for how gender relationships have informed the generation of generations throughout evolutionary history and within primates, within the development of human socieities

### The feminine

Levinas defines the rlationship that one has with the other as "welcoming" . A few pages before he explains that the woman's role is the welcoming.

### Home

Oikos for Levinas is the thing that is important here.
Homeplace from bell hooks that illustrates the importance of home in situatign oneself in a way that fees safe and comforatble within oneself. Levinas talks about the "home" that is made.

Aristotle understands the home as a site of domination.

What is a home though? A home is a place where one meets one's needs

Hannah Arendt understand needs as fundamentatl to domination.

But alongside this idea of "meal tub fellows". This is the root of our word "companion", that "we work, we eat together" of the Diggers.

How do we address our needs together in a way that is respectful to all. What are needs
Kropotkin -- that we can meet our needs in the first place is the remarkable thing and that shows our fundamental indebtedness to one another. A debt that leads to our obligation to one another. THat we are bound together in solidarity.

Solidarity is thus not just a thing that we should strive for but something that already exists. We are already bound to other people. We just need to recognize this indebtedness and to make it manifest. Here I say "indebtedness" rathat than "interconnectedness" because of lateral view. Not something that can be overlayed with by a graph and that we can calculate the most efficiet way to do it. Well actually no it is. Logistics is the way we do it. But also we expereince it as a personal realtionship. Not just that "debt exists in the marketplace" but that I myself am in debt to somebody else and need to pay

the mode that Levinas investigates this is through an understanding of a metabolism of Being.    A process of consumption and production.   This meetabolism of being is understood through the process of maturation as that which establishes the upwards growth of the subject.  THe narrative of Totatlityh and Infinity describes the is that of the generation of gendered generations,  a process taken from Descartes of the idea of continous creation as well as in the bible.  Not a static uniliear time with uniform density flat surface but rather a varying inflected and bent surface which is punctuated by moments of gravity, each of which has a different start and an end, the moments are separated and distinct from each other, but perhaps only retrospectively.  There is a certain pattern to the movement of life, similar to what Levinas refers to as the diastole and the systole of the heart.  Each moment begins as a birth in a moment matures from childhood to married working adulthood and is death and then reborn. So let's try instead to argue this from the perspective of the Jewish patriarchy and that it is in many ways using biblical motifs or at least that it inheriets throughtout from a variety of inlets such as Hebraic scripture as well as the tradional Greek philosophy.  So we can understand the as the first book of the bible genesis, the story of generation of generations. 

Within this process of maturation, Levinas identifies two moments of consumption.  The world emerges as a baby embedded in what he calls a milieu, where the world is already as if they are their own, in which the 


Within the narrative of Totality and Infinity, Levinas describes the life phases of the individual as they progress from birth to maturation

Metabolism: Eating and shitting

Meatabolism of Levinas understood as two step process. In Totality and Infinity, Levinas First is eating. Then is working. The eating as nursing, as mother sucking its teats. The elemental maternal other. Here describe the other as elemental. Then also quote there "capable of killing for a crust of bread" Possession of murder. In Otherwise than Being, he expands this analysis to the idea of breathing

"we make it out of waste and works"

Work and Death

Capable of killing for a crust of bread. Here we find "killing" in the working. What establises property is what exerts ones power over the other, of rendering exeriority into something that can be grasped. By doing so, you repress the otherness of the other. You run it into something that can be manipulated and controlled and dominated. This is in a way killing it. Here killing does not just mean to actually kill someone but rather to appropriate something as one's own. The suspension of their possiblity of being. Oh I know that person as x or y, to submit them as a general concept.

The idea of capabity of the statement I can. I can expert an effort, an interrogation of powre and potency, and of will for defining onesel. The deepest interaction with Nk
Dead capital as found my David McNally, vampire of the market is the thing that is the capital, sucking the life force of the worker. So not just people but the world itself. In fact, what power does is to reify things, to make things, to turn a process into a self subsistent entity. Therefore for the grasping of the self, what the Buddhists call "grasping mind" it is the thing that stills phenomenon such that it can be grasped in a present moment, in a present time, at present place, in the fullness of presence. That is the moment. but it ignores the futuring and the past, the "arising and cessation" of phenomena. Here we can bring in Buddhism.

METABOLICS and GENESIS
What Levinas does that is interesting is that he overlays the conception of a metabolic process with an idea of genesis of gendered generations. The process of genesis. It is birth and role in a family. Understanding the kinship of being and of others. That we are connected to each other as family and as strangers. Orders of relation which Levinas breaks down as a series of relationships, understood as a geneaology of persons, of persons born unto each other

Geneaology not just a succession of accidental events. Well it is that. It is a pataphysicla thing. each thing comes as an unexpleced surprise and must be integrated a la pataphysics where each exception is made more general. born of evolutionary understanding of birth and rebirth. Where each exception occurs as a uniqe chosen one, that it is a unique perso. Same as a set of material relations. If things are all material relations, then aperson lurks behind that

A multitude of family relations -- paternity as a mode of self relation, fraternity as a metaphoric for political citizenship, participation within a public sphere as an equal among equals. But also maternity.

What can we say about maternity then?

MATERNITY
Maternity is important because of why. It underscores all of these types of relationships with each other. The primary understanding as one of need. Need rather than desire. But why? Is that what I want to say for levinas? Yes it is kind of. So the Need is something which has a terminus, which aims towards a goal. That is what happens in the present. Soemthing is fulfilled and filled up. A desire is a thing that is perpetual and unfulfilled. But Levinas says something very interesting then:
"The needs of the other are my own spirtual needs" Material vs spiritual. Recognizing of the cosubstantiality of the spirit of all people. Not so much as "recognizing" but as being inspired. the person around you already drives you in a certain direction. its not even a choice but a drive. Not merely the same thing as a person telling you "do this and do that" but already the fact that we are even participating in the world is already a precondition for us to do anything. that is to say that we do wahat we do because other pepole have already made the world possible for us. That someone made a coffee or shoes for us. That thought up clocks and keeping time. Et cetera. Even that we were born.

Also the web of life

An analysis therefore of what makes the life worth living aroud other people

SPECIES BEING
Here we have the idea of "species being"
What are the inherited ways that we have done with each other
WEll when we even start to look at what we have inhereited we must be mindful of the fact that what we only have a partial perspective on what is going on. We don't know everything. This is another example of the pataphysical as understood by Alfred Jarry. We only make our data based on accumulated evidence. We piece togehter the picutre

Ontogyny follows phylogyny. We can also understand the idea of the maternal through the work of Sarah ruddick and Eva Kittay. We can listen to indigenous and black people. Such as for example bell hooks We can then also turn to the work of Sarah Hrdy as outlining stuff from the domains of anthropology and evolutionalry biology.

## Motherhood

Sarah Ruddick and the thing about Sarah Ruddick is that she emphasizes that the maternal is a practice. Several key points about her

- Not a person but a practice
- Goal of practice is threefold
- It is a demand
- Type of evaluative morality that we have for it
- Every maternal theorist brings up ambiguity
- Bring in Sophie Lewis and also Sarah Lachance Adams

Eva Kittay

- Motherhood and caretaking rather as a set of rights and not like whatshisname the Rawls guy
- The types of domiantion and inequality
- THe ambiguity and complexity of it all

Bell Hooks on Homeplace

- Somewhere to retreat

# Sarah Hrdy

An antrhopoligical dimenstion to this which Hrdy refers to as allomothers.
That it takes a village to raise a child
That the reproduction of life in all species requires rearing
No wait
That the difference between phylogyny and genetics. Or what is it. She makes a distiction between nature and nurture. There is an admixture of the two in this concept. That there is an inheritance but in the expression of the genes. This is a social matter.  
The markers may be there and they have a certain reason for winning out evolutionarily but some are not healthy and die out. Some are there. But all of these are insofar as they are expressed which is the epigenetics thing
