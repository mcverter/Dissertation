question of evolution -- the persistence of life over time.  how does it continue over time.  what is life? is it just a biological process or is there seomthg prof9oudn that undergirds it.  and that connects life to each other 

how is life more than a mechanical process 

1 - The Enduring Legacy of Aristotle: The Battle over Life as Self-Organization or (Genetic-Based) Reproduction
: (1) the capacity to
self-organize and maintain self-organization for an extended period of time against
both external and internal perturbations and (2) the capacity to reproduce and (in
light of Darwin’s theory of evolution) transmit to progeny adaptive characteristics.

Metabolism -- self organized forces of dynamic
* Aristotle's account of metabolism sought to explain how food was processed by the body to provide both heat and the materials for the body's construction and maintenance.

* Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. During this complex process, calories in food and beverages are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function.

* Decay and death

* Two component parts of metabolism: 
* * Eating food -- each of these depend on the other.  conversion of energy to human.  eating as canibalism or murder.  meat is murder.    
* * Breathing air


Home as the place for this:  
* Home as the locus of patriarchal institution

Domination by needs in Arendt

The Home as Welcome Itself 
First of all, Levinas can be understood as subverting gender norms.  Levinas describes the production of the home as “welcome in itself – the feminine being” (157.)  If Levinas here characterizes feminine alterity by the “welcome” it offers, then we can only conclude that the ethical subject is figured as a woman a few pages later.  “I welcome the Other who presents himself in my home by opening my home to him” (171.)  In fact, my identification as a welcoming woman is the very basis of Levinasian ethics, as “metaphysics, transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same” (43.)  Even though Levinas’s equation of the feminine with the domestic is problematic, his characterization of ethical subjectivity and ethics itself as feminine already undermines the Western tradition of patriarchal domination.

Secondly, Levinas can be understood as not only subverting the dominance of the masculinity, but also his conception of the home can be understood as subversion of the political itself.  That is, I would respond to the often-asked question in Levinas’s scholarship, “how can his ethics be turned into a program for politics”, with the response that we should instead investigate the home as a model for human sociality.   Levinas breaks with the heroic fantasy of Western patriarchy that defines the citizen as someone who has (1) individuated himself away from the domestic sphere, and (2) united with other individuals within the political sphere.  In contrast to this, Levinas’s analysis of the home demonstrates how we are always already dependent upon the domestic welcome of an Other and always already responsible for providing domestic welcomes for other Others.


SELF-ORGANIZATION
Heidegger rearticulates the deprecation of the feminine locus of the house in hiw wartime writings.  In Introduction to Metaphysics, Heidegger elaborates his characterization of the Greek concept of Being, physis, as the self-blossoming emergence of Being, as something that manifests through the dynamics of violence, power, and struggle.  According to Heidegger, however, this conception became corrupted as it drifted away from its Greek root.  He explains, “This basic Greek word for essent is commonly translated as ‘nature.’  This derives from the Latin translation, natura, which properly means ‘to be born,’ ‘birth.’ But with this Latin translation the original meaning of the Greek word physis is thrust aside, the actual philosophical force of the Greek word is destroyed.”  Exemplifying Nancy Hartsock’s critique of heroism, this quote displays the degree to which Heidegger refuses to accept the reality of human birth, the fact that all created beings are fundamentally dependent.  The notion of a self-emerging, self-manifesting physis seems like a strange male fantasy of independence.  Heidegger refuses to accept the dynamics of creation, that being is not self-emergent but always dependent upon an other that brings it forth.  
 He interprets the polis as emerging out of the Greek articulation of Being itself.  He asserts that physis, the self-standing and self-emerging, is equivalent to logos, the gathering together of the gathered, and that the polis is the site in which this gathering-together occurs.  He further remarks, “Polis means, rather, the place, the there (Da), wherein and as which historical being-there (Dasein) is.”  That is, the very place where human existence occurs, the very Da of one’s Dasein is defined to be the polis.  The polis is thus deemed the space where authentic human emergence can take place; where poets can actually be poets, priests can actually be priests, and rulers can actually be rulers.  Heidegger explains his usage of the copula, stating la: “Be, but this means: as violent men to use power, to become preeminent in historical being as creators, as men of action.”

BIRTH NON CHOSEN 
   In contrast, Levinas remarks that  “the idea of causa sui … is belied by birth, non-chosen and impossible to choose … which situates the will in an anarchic world, that is, a world without origin.”

The Home in bell hooks
why the interbeing is a separation 
. In addition to reconsidering the importance of maternal care, other feminist thinkers have similarly re-evaluated the category of domestic nurturance. For example, bell hooks discusses how black women maintained what she calls ‘home place’ as a site of resistance against rampant racism, a refuge where people could gather and heal themselves from the wounds inflicted by a hostile society (2001, pp. 41–9).

Also a communion of needs, the companion, in aristotle the meal tub fellows.  

Birth as different process of generation.  A connection to other people as through a family, something volutary and involuntary connection with other people. 

And other peoplea se tending to our needs
through the worker the person externalizes himself and through the abstraction of their labor
in birth and practice of mothering through the substanc eof the human body itself  
levinas and materiality and a temporality 


Mitchell The gist of the distinction I was trying to make was between the list of good things alternate caregivers may do (e.g., defending a child against an attacker) that you had provided and the idea that such caregivers’ involvement in a child’s life may reduce the likelihood of a child being subject to coercive treatment, even by other caregivers…the idea being I can imagine a protective-yet-coercive grandparent and yet there is empirical evidence that maybe the cooccurrence of coercion and that kind of protection is…not as common as their decoupling.

The domus as feast locus with dom as loafward harkens back to readings about the closure of the commons and prior transition to grain-based diets. Prompts me to reconsider the potential power of events like the block party or church social…looking through the questionable etymological link between potluck and potlatch.

So what's really so interesting about Sarah Hrdy's argument is that it takes place against the background of familial violence, specifically infanticide -- the grandmother is lauded for her fearless defense of the baby against male violence.  Hrdy does mention some formula for formula for calculating social bonds from capacity for survival.  I don't know how  a mathematical reduction would affect the argument.  In any case I don't understand the distinction between these "some of the behaviors you indicated seemed less relational (how we treat each other) and more motivated by relation (defending you against an attacker/illness because you're my grandkid...and maybe I let the attacker's grandkid wither)"

As far as the family and domination:  yes, exactly the patriarchal family is constructed as such.  Domus = home, as in domicile; but also Dom = domination.  The Dominator is the ruler of the home.  But this definition of the home as a locus for domination also lies alongside the definition of the home as a place where needs are met, where things are eaten, where the metabolism of life occurs:

From an old paper:
"Not only does Aristotle claim that the home is encompassed within the state, but he also intersects these two communal spheres in the figure of the patriarch, who establishes his dominion over the domestic sphere through a process of domination and domestication, and who establishes the science of oikonomos (economy) to order the household and to acquire property (1996, 1253b1ff). However, Aristotle supplements this patriarchal analysis of the household with a secondary definition. The household is not simply the locus of domination, but more fundamentally, it is the association where people come together to attend to their everyday needs and wants, the communal space where people become companions through the activity of eating together (Aristotle, 1996, 1252b12–20)."

Hey Mitchell I think I smell what you're cookin and FWIW there is a body of empirical research that isn't explicitly coded as anarchist that may be of interest. 

It talks about things like "coercive family processes" and "the coercive cycle" (which may have mappings to that undefined menace, domination) in contrast to practices more consistent with prosocial relations, flourishing, etc. [Disclaimer: a bunch of this research is couched in terms of social control in the literature, i.e., funding sources want an answer to "how do 'we' prevent infants from becoming criminals?", though findings may have more general applicability.] 
Relations of coercion within family systems prompt some of my concerns regarding non-state or informal hierarchy. Also, the idea that state systems "roll their shit downhill" such that familial relations tend toward coercion may be an oversimplification that nevertheless indicates a role played by economic and political context in shaping familial interactions such that child and caregiver flourishing/freedom is damaged in a way that tends to reproduce intergenerationally (incarceration, impoverishment, etc.).   

I'd need to search for pertinent publications, but I recall anecdotally from my time in the field and in discussions with colleagues that the involvement of so-called alternate caregivers (usually "grandparents") in children's lives tends to correlate inversely with coercive caregiving practices--even those of a primary, non-alternate caregiver--and positively with indicators of child well-being. I'm not sure how much of that may be attributed to a self-selection bias at play (e.g., I get along with my dad because he wasn't awful so now both of us aren't going to be awful to my kid) or how much may be attributed to resource sufficiency (e.g., I might not take as many coercive shortcuts if I had a little help with this kid), but some of the behaviors you indicated seemed less relational (how we treat each other) and more motivated by relation (defending you against an attacker/illness because you're my grandkid...and maybe I let the attacker's grandkid wither). So there may be bridges to be built. 

There's that old line about everybody being brothers; I'll further consider everybody being each other's grandmothers (or alternate caregivers).
"I am not my brother's keeper (and each of us might be his grandmother)."

Well honestly Wayne, I think that's pretty important and interesting, really.  I don't quite know how to think about it yet and I haven't been able to turn to my research yet.  Perhaps you could become a subject of empirical research.  

I am basically following through with the lines of questioning formulated Kropotkin, who calls mutual aid "a feature of the greatest importance for the maintenance of life, the preservation of each species, and its further evolution,” and further poses this idea of evolution in terms of *birth*, of material and maternal sustenance, a metabolic and generative transmutation of past substances into that which sustains me, into this thing that I consider myself. “If we have access to intellectual satisfactions and live in not too bad material circumstances, it is because we have benefited, through an accident of birth, by the exploitation to which the workers are subjected; and therefore the struggle for the emancipation of the workers is a duty, a debt which we must repay.” Here, the references are clear echoes of the metabolic described by Marx, how living labor power becomes is converted to the dead capital, consumable within commodities.  But besides this there is also the generative of generations, the labor of birthing labor.

Anthropologist Sarah Hrdy seemingly answers the Kropotkin's inquiry into the evolutionary importance mutual aid in her book "Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding."  I have been following this throughline for several years ty chrough the metaphorics of the mother, but Hardy clarifies that the nuturing of genesis occurs not just through the mother herself but to the community of *allomothers*, Other Mothers who perform the practice of mothering.  The most siginifcant of these Other Mothers is the grandmother.  Among other primate species, a higher proportion of human women live well past their childbearing years into old age.  The mother's mother is particularly important. Matrilieanal kin will both guard the baby from the attackers and return the baby to its mother after watching it.  According to Hrdy "Maternal grandmothers in particular attach high priority to keeping the mother and her children as well-nourished and healthy as possible", caring for both the cared-for grandchild and the caring mother. Hrdy concludes that the figure of the grandmother is the human secret to the development of mutual understanding, of prosociality, of mutual aid. 
"In an emergency, however, these same socially marginalized old matrons become the most active in defending the group’s feeding grounds from neighboring groups. They are also the most daring in defending infants attacked by infanticidal males. Among langurs, sooty mangabeys, and savanna baboons, it is these 20- to30-­year-­olds who take bigger risks to defend an endangered infant than the victim’s own mother does."

"And no single class of care­givers made a bigger difference than grandmothers. Their presence was correlated with higher child survival
in ev­ery one of the twelve so­ci­e­ties for which relevant data had been recorded."

We see the grandmother's labor everywhere -- as abuelitas selling grasshoppers in the Oaxaca markets, for example.  And below in the meditation on the "seven generations" by Kyle Taylor Lucas of the Tulalip Tribes and the Nlaka’pamux First Nation.

Not sure what you think?

If anyone knows *where* to look in Leguin or maybe Octavia Butler, that would be great -- I am a slow reader

I reported about the "next seven generations" a few years ago.  Anyone know some good indigenous elaborations of this?
..., an enrolled member of the Tulalip Tribes (USA) and the Nlaka’pamux First Nation (Canada), speaks eloquently on the importance of the Olympia Port Blockade. “This struggle is important because our planet is on fire. As an indigenous woman, I feel a duty to honor my elders and the legacy of my ancestors in caring for this mother earth – and, moreover; I feel a responsibility to my grandchildren and the next seven generations to stand up to the economic machinery propped up by the government, specifically the Port of Olympia, in perpetuating the warming of this planet and the poisoning of water, essential to life. We call ourselves Water Protectors and we were especially inspired by the courageous stand taken at Standing Rock during DAPL. We indigenous peoples came together with our allies here at Olympia Stand to resist the Port of Olympia’s forced complicity in propping up dirty hydraulic fracturing in North Dakota that these proppants support.”

Hey all,
I have been working for a while to consider how *maternal practice* as defined by Sara Ruddick as "a practice that maintains safety of the child, promotes its strength, and allows it to flourish without establishing any ownership over it" in order to embody the anarchocommunist description of mutual aid “a feature of the greatest importance for the maintenance of life, the preservation of each species, and its further evolution,”

However, Anthropologist Sarah Hrdy posits the *grandmother* as the allomother whose care is most important to caretaking and to species evolution.

Are there any good writings from or about anarchist grandparents and elders more generally? Maybe from Zapatista writings about elders or other indigenous sources? Or Leguin?

Thanks!
