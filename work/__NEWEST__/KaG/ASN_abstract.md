which posit Becoming as emerging from the dynamic clashes within a field of anonymous forces. My analysis, taken from Emmanuel Levinas, articulates Becoming a mode of relating to other persons through two moments: (1) the *metabolics* of consumption describe the process by which the material being of the other becomes the self, which Levinas explores under the motifs of eating and breathing; (2) the *genetics* of regeneration describe the way in which the material being of my self becomes the other, which Levinas describes under the motif of maternity.  I will explore "maternity" through what Sarah Ruddick calls *maternal practice* that preserves the life of the child, nourishes their growth and prepares them for acceptance in wider society.  Feminist anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy clarifies that what is important is not merely the person of the mother, but the community of *allomothering*-- particularly the *grandmother*, the person who takes care both of the child and the mother of the child, as the most fundamental resason for the evolution of human understanding and prosocial behavior.  The talk will end by reflecting on thinking across generations, as many native peoples do, about how we can enrich our regenerational thinking and practice as anarchists.
