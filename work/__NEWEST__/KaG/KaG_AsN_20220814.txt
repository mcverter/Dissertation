In this talk, I intend to continue my exploration of anarchafeminist thinking by bringing Kropotkin's anarchocommunism into dialogue with feminist writings on care and motherhood. By doing so, I am hoping to disentangle some of the language that we have inherited when we speak about the social, the political the ontological and epistemic, the existential. What are the features of the patriarchal have invaded our thinking to construct our views of the political social  In particular, I will consider how Kropotkin's claim that mutual aid and mutual support are "feature[s] of the greatest importance for the maintenance of life, the preservation of each species, and its further evolution" with anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's discussion of grandmothers as others in her book "Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding." 

Given that our central term in this discussion is "evolution", my first inclination is to inquire into the meaning of this term.  Evolution traces the Becoming of life, the way that living systems develop over time. It is therefore a particular case of the philosophical inquiry into "Becoming"

The philosophical inquiry into becoming often stands in relation to a thinking of Being, of existence as permanent essences underlying all particular beings; upon these substances stand our usage of nouns, linguistic substantives, that establish stable identities and legal persons; that situate consciousness and agency in subjects, that respond to the accusation of "essentialism", and so on. In contrast, Becoming traces how things change over time, the ways in which "me" right now is related to the "me" a hundred yards away from here, a second in the past or a second in the future  -- or even if time can be considered a series of moments. One of the first thinkers of Becoming, Heracitus of Ephesus, expressed this in his assertion that one can not step into the same river twice, and the assertion tat "everything flows". That is, all particular things emerge as an effect, as the temporary assemblages of the fluxuation of anonymous forces.  Heraclitus pronounced conflict and war to be the dynamic tension behind the creation of all things: "War is father/king/lord (  πατήρ ) of all; and some he has shown as gods, others men; some he has made slaves, others free".    


The traces of this still affect our modes of conceiving the dynamics of the flow of time. Broadly speaking, we receive this Heraclitean image of conflict as being fundmanetal to change from four different streams of thought 
1.  Mechanical/Newtonian:  From atomism, empiricism and mechanism, we receive the idea that everything is ultimately constituted by the collision of particles according to newtonian equation Force=mass*acceleration, like billiard balls on a pool table.
2.  Spinozist: The given or actual essence of any thing is the strivng by which it endevours to persist in itw own being and to increase its power of action. 
3.  Hegelian/Marxist.  All historical development occurs through and as dialectics, the conflict between two opposing forces. 
4.  Nietzschean:  Nietzsche develops the idea of wills-to-power as fundamental forces that express themselves and become manifested through persons and groups and other entities, differentiating the wills to powerful of the strong man from the will to power of the weak man of ressentiment. 
5. Deleuze: These Heraclitean-Nietzschean strandsa re continued through writers like Foucault, who maps all social relations as powers and counter powers, and more cleaerly by Deleuze, who synthesizes Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Bergson into an idea of becoming, as active force, one that lacks a subject from itelsef, an assemblage of the forces withinit and of which it constitutes a part, desiring-machines acting through the body.

 In positing destruction, death, violence, conflict and war as fundamental to creation, Heraclitus exemplifies the way in which early greek philosophical and political thinking drew from its origin from the barracks community that founded the early city states.  This perspective is also 
It is important to note that, even in one of the foundational texts of political philosophy, there are already clues that point towards other possibilities. In the first lines of his treatise on Politics, Aristotle declares that the polis (city-state) is only one among several kinds of human koinon (community), another of which is the oikos (home) (1996, 1251b1ff ). Unfortunately, however, the analysis he offers of the home is the prototypically patriarchal one, a definition that has been influential throughout Western history. Not only does Aristotle claim that the home is encompassed within the state, but he also intersects these two communal spheres in the figure of the patriarch, who establishes his dominion over the domestic sphere through a process of domination and domestication, and who establishes the science of oikonomos (economy) to order the household and to acquire property (1996, 1253b1ff). However, Aristotle supplements this patriarchal analysis of the household with a secondary definition. The household is not simply the locus of domination, but more fundamentally, it is the association where people come together to attend to their everyday needs and wants, the communal space where people become companions through the activity of eating together (Aristotle, 1996, 1252b12–20).

Instead of this I would like to talk about  a different form of the interaction of becoming that is the one taken from Levinas.  The importance of this is that it's not in the form of a war and it's not in the terms of an anonymous form of the nameless forces colliding with each other.

matrilineal society is not the same as a “matriarchal” one—the inverse of a patriarchal society in which powerful matrilines maintain public and private social control. Indeed, outside of myth, I know of no evidence that any matriarchal society ever existed. However, there is general agreement among anthropologists that women living matrilocally among their kin tend to have more autonomy than when they do not. Such women are likely to have many more opportunities to take advantages of devices such as the fiction of “partible paternity.” By contrast, the whole thrust of patriarchal societies is

Part of the answer lies with a very special type of alloparent—postmenopausal females, former mothers who lived on not just for a few years, but for decades after their own last birth. Significantly, these older women gathered more food than they consumed. New information on just how much of this surplus postreproductive females may have contributed to the weaned offspring of others is changing the way some anthropologists think about the evolution of extra-long human childhoods.

to explain maternal behavior is as a special case of Hamilton’s rule (see above, page 63) to explain altruistic acts between related individuals. Applied in this context, Hamilton’s rule is not so much about genes (after all, no one has any idea what is going on at the level of genes, or what mechanisms are involved) as it is about predicting when one individual should incur a cost on behalf of another. At this level, Hamilton’s rule is a formally organized metaphor for how natural selection shaped the economy of maternal emotions, with C being the cost to the donor, B being the benefit to the recipient, and r being the degree of relatedness:

The key to the puzzle was the high rate of infanticide, which was occurring right after birth and in private.

By endowing human infants with a long mother-centered primate heritage, by envisioning infants with special needs and mothers as creatures especially designed to satisfy them, and by situating an infant’s sense of security and self in the availability of this specially equipped mother, evolutionists like Bowlby and Trivers appeared to be imposing on women painful choices no man need ever make: her aspirations versus her infant’s well-being; vocation or reproduction.Twenty years later, I still return to this topic with trepidation.

The real constraint on working mothers has little to do with imagined ideals of Pleistocene motherhood, far more to do with locating and enlisting reliable, motivated, long-term allomothers. Human infants need mothers and allomothers to keep them warm, safe, mobile, stimulated, clean, fed, hygienically hydrated, and, most important, to communicate tenderly and responsively their commitment to go on caring. Hour by hour, supplying this kind of care is tedious.

that infants strive for attachment to their mothers not only to stay close lest something pounce, but also to stave off the possibility of maternal retrenchment, and forestall it in any of the manifold forms it takes, ranging from mild negligence to abandonment. Babies are geared to making sure that maternal care is forthcoming and ongoing. Among humans, protection from predators comes as a bonus from maintaining this even more crucial attachment.

Robustness, plumpness, cuteness were not just useful physiological attributes. They were signals to the mother that the benifit function in Hamilton’s equation was well worth whatever cost it might entail for a mother to care for her infant.
