In this talk, I intend to continue my exploration of anarchafeminist thinking by bringing Kropotkin's anarchocommunism into dialogue with feminist writings on care and motherhood.  In particular, I will consider how Kropotkin's claim that mutual aid and mutual support are "feature[s] of the greatest importance for the maintenance of life, the preservation of each species, and its further evolution" with anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's discussion of grandmothers as others in her book "Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding." 

Given that our central term in this discussion is "evolution", my first inclination is to inquire into the meaning of this term.  Evolution, the study of how living systems develop over time, is a particular case of the philosophical inquiry into "Becoming"

The philosophical inquiry into becoming often stands in relation to a thinking of Being that understands the world as constituted by permanent essences underlying all particular beings; upon these substances stand our usage of nouns in everyday language; they establish stable identities and legal persons; they situate consciousness and the agency in human subjects, and so on. In contrast, Becoming traces how things change over time, the ways in which "me" right now is related to the "me" a hundred yards away from here, a second in the past or a second in the future. One of the first thinkers of Becoming, Heraclitus of Ephesus, expressed this idea in his assertion that one can not step into the same river twice, and the motto that "everything flows". That is, all individual, identifiable things emerge as an effect, as the temporary assemblages of the flux of anonymous forces.  

How does this flux occur? According to Heraclitus, conflict and war constitute the dynamic tension behind the creation of all things: "War is father/king/lord (  πατήρ ) of all; and some he has shown as gods, others men; some he has made slaves, others free".  The logic of creation for Heraclitus already entails a certain set of patriarchal relations of political domination.  

Although the patriarchal resonances of Heraclitus's thinking aren't always so prominent, his idea that conflict is fundamental to the dynamic of becoming, to the flow of change over time, has been widely influential.   
1.  Mechanism:  Atomism, empiricism and mechanism all inherit the idea that every material thing becomes constituted by the collision of particles, which can be expressed by the interaction of Newtonian and non-newtonian forces. 
2.  Spinoza: Spinoza borrows the idea that a thing's essence is constituted by its striving to persist in its own being and to increase its own power of action. 
3.  Hegel/Marx: Hegel and Marx argue that all historical development occurs through conflicts between dialectically opposed forces. 
4.  Nietzsche:  Nietzsche claims that the wills-to-power are fundamental forces that become expressed through persons and groups and other entities, that become manifested in the strong as heroic virtues and in the weak as ressentiment.   
5. Deleuze: Deleuze amalgamates ideas from Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Bergson, understanding becoming as a process through which desiring-machines create assemblages that constitute identities as temporary effects.  

In positing conflict and war as fundamental to creation, Heraclitus's model of Becoming exemplifies the way that early Greek thinking and political organization grew out of the role of the masculine warrior-hero.  Is there a way of conceiving of becoming in terms of regeneration rather than domination and creative destruction?  

My understanding of becoming is influenced by the thinking of the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, indicates that every stage of becoming is produced not from the collision of nameless forces but rather from relationships with other persons.  Levinas describes the emergent individual as being steeping in an elemental medium, filling itself with what is other than itself.  This relationship is a metabolic one, in which the nascent entity relates to its environment as nourishment, feeding from the world in order to constitute its own selfhood. However, the otherness of the world always comes to us through relations with other people.  Our subsitence and persistence in the world is already constituted by a debt to other people who have provided us with the material substance for existence. The oxygen that  constitutes the substance of our being once constituted the substance of another person.   The products that we consume are the alienated an
d objectifed remnants of the lives of others, produced by their living labor-power. Thus, the dynamic of human becoming isn't simply a metabolic one but also a generational one; resulting not only from the incorporation of our enironment, but also from the events of birthing and childraising, connecting us to generations of persons. We are neither self-created nor spontaneously emergent but born into the world, dependeant upon others for our sustenance.   Levinas refers to this combination of material and historical debt as an anarchy and as a maternity in which "I am bound to others before being tied to my own body.”

In her book "Maternal Thinking", Sarah Ruddick  defines the maternal standpoint not as an instinctive disposition or a specifically gendered role but rather as a set of practices that preserves the life of the child, nourishes their growth and prepares them for acceptance in the wider society.  Given that human infants are not physically or mentally capable of taking care of themselves for extended periods of time, the maternal practice that preserves human life is essential for both individual and collective survival.  

The work of anthropologist Sarah Hrdy can add an additional dimension to this idea of maternal practice and highlight its significance for Kropotkin's claim that mutual aid is central for evolution.  Hrdy explains that evolutionary development is influenced not just by the genetic materials passed down, but also by the entire environental context that conditions the expressions of that genetic material.  In particular, maternal effects are the ways that environment surrounding the mother influences the biological development of the child. The mother constitues the most important environment for the child, and her most important environment for the child is the mother herself, so the quality of her survival directly determines the nature of the child's development. A female's capacity to pass on her genetic material depends upon how well she selects her mate and how well she can sustain and preserve the life of the child and sustain its growth. Historically, however, most mothers have had to do some sort of labor in addition to raising a child, and have often had multiple chidren to raise.  the mother often has several children to  birth.  Therefore, the evolutoinary success of childrearing does not rest on the mother alone but rather on the community of caretakers around her, in particlar what practice of mothering does not fall on the mother alone but rather on the community of caretakers surrounding her, particularly what anthorpoogists refer to as "allomothers" persons other than the mother who are willing and capable of performing the task of childcare.  Hrdy argues that  

 She depends on allomothers, someone other than the mother who is capable of helping the infant.  The mother needs someone who can taek care of the child that will return the child .  THe intercession of the grandmother is what was able to raise the child long enough to grow its brain.  Shared care and provisioning of offspirng to other peopel si what enables that.  Allows mother to conserve enrgy for herself and other children .  Enables the child to grow up with big brains and with prosocial impulses htat recognize the theory of other minds and prosocial tendencies .  scarcity of motivated alloparents. Hwo do they keep their children safe and secure? Part of the reason for this is that it's the grandmother.  The grandmother has proven to be the most resourceful, gathering more food than others, knowing where to collect food.   the postreproductive female, makes an ideal alloparcnt, assisting other mothers to protect or provide for their weaned offspring.  simultaneously more self-sacrificing and more heroic as they age.
In the case of human foragers, mothers have trouble finding someone both willing and qualified to fill this role.Under what circumstances can a mother safely afford to delegate care to allomothers?  the reason why old women livedd longer after they ovulate is impact on their grandchildren
having a grandmother is the ace in the hole for the reproduction of the species and survivability  the reason why old women livedd longer after they ovulate is impact on their grandchildren  most daring in defending from infanticidal males  spends the most time near the youngest or least experienced daughter who needs her support
grandmothers influence the reproductive success of kin  maternal grandmothers in partciular attach a high proiotiy in keeping their mother and children as well nourished and healthy as posible

Long lives, and with them long childhoods, would have altered the hominid equation. Small reproductive payoffs from being smarter would be sufficient to select for sapient brains in worlds where greater intelligence did not have to compensate completely for the enormous costs of delayed maturation. Of such lives one could confidently say, I grow slowly, therefore I think. I develop slowly, ergo cogito.  As Harvard psychologist Marc Hauser likes to sum it up, what distinguishes humans from other apes is our “ability to put ourselves emotionally and cognitively in someone else’s shoes.”15

Sustenance rather than competition as being the central element in human evoution is already in Aristotle's politics.  Aristotle explains that besides the polis, the family is another mode of being in community with each other.  However, Aristotle conceives of the family through the perspective of the householder who practices the of art of household management, oikonomos, in order to control the people in it and to the domination and control.  Alongside this image of the family as something to be controlled and dominated, the 
However, Aristotle supplements this patriarchal analysis of the household with a secondary definition. The household is not simply the locus of domination, but more fundamentally, it is the association where people come together to attend to their everyday needs and wants, the communal space where people become companions through the activity of eating together (Aristotle, 1996, 1252b12–20).

We already find a supressed hint of this within the text of Aristotle's Politics.  Whereas Aristotle considers the political sphere to be the space of freedom and conversation for the male citizens of the polis, he places the

 destruction, death, violence, conflict and war as fundamental to creation, Heraclitus exemplifies the way in which early greek philosophical and political thinking drew from its origin from the barracks community that founded the early city states. Politics as a way of competing between people for supremacy and command. This patriarchal perspective perspective is also echoed in Aristotle's description of political.  In addition to the
It is important to note that, even in one of the foundational texts of political philosophy, there are already clues that point towards other possibilities. In the first lines of his treatise on Politics, Aristotle declares that the polis (city-state) is only one among several kinds of human koinon (community), another of which is the oikos (home) (1996, 1251b1ff ). Unfortunately, however, the analysis he offers of the home is the prototypically patriarchal one, a definition that has been influential throughout Western history. Not only does Aristotle claim that the home is encompassed within the state, but he also intersects these two communal spheres in the figure of the patriarch, who establishes his dominion over the domestic sphere through a process of domination and domestication, and who establishes the science of oikonomos (economy) to order the household and to acquire property (1996, 1253b1ff). However, Aristotle supplements this patriarchal analysis of the household with a secondary definition. The household is not simply the locus of domination, but more fundamentally, it is the association where people come together to attend to their everyday needs and wants, the communal space where people become companions through the activity of eating together (Aristotle, 1996, 1252b12–20).

And a model of living that occurs thorgh out the world is that of the household or the oikos.  THe economic relationships that we make for each other is perverted by the idea of domination that is explored by Aristotle.  On the one hand, we have the idea that there is a household manager.  That the man is the person who is repsonsible for dominating needs and that it requires the person of the householder to control it and that the person that is the controller of the household and the one who then makes the way that the needs are controlled and that this is what requires a system of domination and control.  On the other hand the idea that the person is someone htat there is a meal tub fellows that it is a place where people gather together to meet their needs.  And that we are somehow constituted by and through our needs and that we meet together in the home.  The idea of the home and the social is that we nurturance  of each other.  bell hooks speaks of this in her essay on homeplace.  That the need for a home is a way that people retreat to in order to be healed and be taken care of

We can see this idea of maternity as reflected in the ideas of ecofemnism.  The idea of maternal practice as reflected in the work of Sarah Ruddick.  There is a threefold goal of the mohter which is namely to take care of the kid, to preserve the planet.  Ruddick presents the work of maternal practice as being threefold: 
  Ruddick defines the maternal standpoint not as an instinctive disposition or a specifically gendered role but rather as a set of practices that preserves the life of the child, nourishes their growth and prepares them for acceptance in the wider society.
