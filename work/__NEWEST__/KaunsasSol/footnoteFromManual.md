The footnote is a bit of information    
or note about a topic in a reading.    
The footnote is connected by a     
reference number[^1] that corresponds     
with the same numbered footnote.    
Here, clicking the reference number  
directs us to the related footnote.  
The footnote gets its name[^2]     
because of its placement     
in the footer of a page.[^3]  


[^1]: Reference numbers are written in superscript.          

[^2]: As always, the footnote is placed in the footer, hence the name.          

[^3]: The footer is the margin at the bottom of the page usally containing information        
such as page numbers, copyrights, references, etc.
