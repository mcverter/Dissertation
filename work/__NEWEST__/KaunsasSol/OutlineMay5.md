"Don't break that tree. Trees are people too" 
  -- Camille Dugee 

1. Introduction
This paper takes its inspiration from our great friend, the late Sol Neely, asks us to allow the writings of Emmanuel Levinas to become inspired by indigenous thought in order to elaborate an ecological phenomenology that takes etchical responsibility for the "the irreducible kinship relation expressed by 'all my relations' —the utterance itself of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard".  The question of our ethical relationship to nature seems especially pertinent now, both for us right here right now at this conference where we are considering the relationship between humanism and otherness and for us as humans responsible for the exploitation and decimation of the natural world.  

2. Heraclitus
To do this, we begin by considering Levinas's work as a response to not just Heidegger's thinking of Being but moreover to Heraclitus's thinking of Becoming, whose dictum  Πάντα ῥεῖ,  everything flows, is complemented by his assertion that war is the master-father of all beings (πόλεμος πάντων πάτερ εστί) .  This idea of becoming as force inspires the entire genealogy descended from Heraclitus, opposition of forces runs through empiricism, materialism, Newtonianism, Spinoza, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Deleuze, Foucault, as so on. Levinas's response to this Heraclitus's truth of becoming as war takes many forms

Throughout his work, Levinas dialogue with ontology entails not only a subversion of the meaning of Being but also a further perversion of the notion of Becoming, the tradition that runs from Heraclitus's dictum Πάντα ῥεῖ (everything flows), through Spinoza's conatus essendi as striving to persevere in Being through Hegel's dialectical struggle as becoming, through  Nietzsche's Will to Power as Becoming, through Heidegger's analysis of Being as ecstatic Becoming.
