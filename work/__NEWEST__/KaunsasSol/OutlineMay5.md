"Don't break that tree. Trees are people too" 
  -- Camille Dugee 

1. Introduction
This paper takes its inspiration from our great friend, the late Sol Neely, asks us to allow the writings of Emmanuel Levinas to become inspired by indigenous thought in order to elaborate an ecological phenomenology that takes etchical responsibility for the "the irreducible kinship relation expressed by 'all my relations' —the utterance itself of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard".  The question of our ethical relationship to nature seems especially pertinent now, both for us right here right now at this conference where we are considering the relationship between humanism and otherness and for us as humans responsible for the exploitation and decimation of the natural world.  

2. Heraclitus
To do this, we begin by considering Levinas's work as a response to not just Heidegger's thinking of Being but moreover to Heraclitus's thinking of Becoming, whose dictum  Πάντα ῥεῖ,  everything flows, is complemented by his assertion that war is the master-father of all beings (πόλεμος πάντων πάτερ εστί) .  This idea of becoming as force inspires the entire genealogy descended from Heraclitus, opposition of forces runs through empiricism, materialism, Newtonianism, Spinoza, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Deleuze, Foucault, as so on. Levinas's response to this Heraclitus's truth of becoming as war takes many forms

CONTINUOUS CREATION
The first blessing before the morning Shema goes on to praise Hashem,

* Time as continuous creation, from Descartes and Bergson
30You will send forth Your spirit and they will be created, and You will renew the surface of the ground.	 	לתְּשַׁלַּ֣ח ר֖וּֽחֲךָ יִבָּֽרֵא֑וּן וּ֜תְחַדֵּ֗שׁ פְּנֵ֣י אֲדָמָֽה:
31T
 In verse 30, the Psalm describes God bringing death to creatures by inhaling their spirits, then creating others by exhaling new breath into their lungs. And thus תחדש פני אדמה, “You renew the face of the earth.”
Psalmo 104:30 continuous breathing of god
When you send your breath/spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth

Levinas: Regeneration of generations
For Levinas, the generative family demonstrates that, rather than merely issuing from an origin, existence is a continuous creation
* Time as continuous creation, as the genesis of gendered generations, time as continuous regeneration 

There is a sense in which Totality and Infinity may be read as if were the first Book of Moses, Genesis or בְּרֵאשִׁית, [15] the story of the regenerating engendering of generations.  It tells a story of life stage development, from the newborn nursing on the element through job and mature home ownership, through old age, through sex and sacrifice and murder, to the rebirth of a new subjectivity who begins the story at the start in naissance an . At the end you realize that the the sacrifice and murder of the self is what constintued the infant at the begining.

the entire genealogy flowing

Throughout his work, Levinas dialogue with ontology entails not only a subversion of the meaning of Being but also a further perversion of the notion of Becoming, the tradition that runs from Heraclitus's dictum Πάντα ῥεῖ (everything flows), through Spinoza's conatus essendi as striving to persevere in Being through Hegel's dialectical struggle as becoming, through  Nietzsche's Will to Power as Becoming, through Heidegger's analysis of Being as ecstatic Becoming.
