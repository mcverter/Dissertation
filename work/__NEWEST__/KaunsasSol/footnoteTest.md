1. Heraclitus
To do this, we begin by considering Levinas's work as a inversion to not just Heidegger's thinking of Being but moreover as a perversion of Heraclitus's thinking of Becoming, whose dictum  Πάντα ῥεῖ[^1],  everything flows, is complemented by his assertion that war is the master-father of all beings[^2] .  Levinas opens up Totality and Infinity renouncing the "obscure fragments of Heraclitus { that } prove that being reveals itself as war to philosophical thought."[^3]  This idea of becoming as force inspires the entire genealogy descended from Heraclitus, opposition of forces runs through empiricism, mechanism's billiard ball materialism[^4], Newton's forces, Spinoza's conatus, Hegel's dialectic, Nietzsche's will to power, Heidegger's ecstatic Being, Deleuze, Foucault, as so on.[^5]  


[^1] ποταμοῖσι τοῖσιν αὐτοῖσιν ἐμβαίνουσιν ἕτερα καὶ ἕτερα ὕδατα ἐπιῤῥεῖ· καὶ ψυχαὶ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑγρῶν ἀναθυμιῶνται. (You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you. -- Wikipedia translation).  Fragment 12

[^2]  πόλεμος πάντων μὲν πατήρ ἐστι, πάντων δὲ βασιλεύς, καὶ τοὺς μὲν θεοὺς ἔδειξε τοὺς δὲ ἀνθρώπους, τοὺς μὲν δούλους ἐποίησε τοὺς δὲ ἐλευθέρους. (War is the master-father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some slaves and some free.)  Heraclitus, Fragment 53

[^4] "Neither have we from body any idea of the beginning of motion. A body at rest affords us no idea of any active power to move; and when it is set in motion itself, that motion is rather a passion, than an action in it. For when the ball obeys the motion of a billiard stick, it is not any action of the ball, but bare passion: also when by impulse it sets another ball in motion that lay in its way, it only communicates the motion it had received from another, and loses in itself so much as the other received: which gives us but a very obscure idea of an active power moving in body, whilst we observe it only to transfer, but not produce any motion. For it is but a very obscure idea of power, which reaches not the production of the action, but the continuation of the passion." Locke, Essays Concerning Human Understanding -- "Of Power" XXI.04  < Check book one of Hobbes Leviathan too for mechanism / materialism >
