1. Sol -- indigenous ecophenomenology
    * In contrast, it is the social relation—the irreducible kinship relation expressed by “all my relations”—the utterance itself of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard through an inspired eco-phenomenology. 

2. Becoming as forces
  1. The problem of the "elementary forces" in Reflections on Hitlerism, etc 
  2. Heraclitus tradition of Becoming, Truth as War, Being and Becoming as War, Strife, Mastery, War is the father of all things, patriarchal
  3. This isn't the main focus of it at all but I have been investigating Levinas as a response to the Heraclitean idea of Becoming -- "everything flows" but also "war is the father/master (pater) of all things".  The Heraclitean tradition of Becoming as the opposition of forces runs through empiricism, materialism, Newtonianism Spinoza, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Deleuze, etc.  
  4. humanism of the other is a series of essays responding to the antihumanism of merleua ponty and heidegger but also a struggle with nietzcheanism.  "Where unfaithfulness to Nietzsche is seen as blasphemy"
  5. the dread of thes primal elemental forces that haunts this work from 30s hitlerism the asertion of power as force.  the idea of the heidegger as a being subsumiinng ewverything.  the being of beings.  but the real problem of levinas scholars is that of the envirnoment ann so the defense of humanism has to be the artiulateable with the ecological consciousness . this theme has been explored much better by others
  



  
3. Quantum oscillations
  1. Material things as a standing wave, as an interference pattern, a deBroglie wave packet or matter wave, the amphibology of a standing presence and a fluxuation of the continuous creation of becoming
  2. De Broglie called this wave the "phase wave" («onde de phase» in French)
  3. Background radiation.    Electrical network frequency (ENF) analysis is an audio forensics technique for validating audio recordings by comparing frequency changes in background mains hum in the recording with long-term high-precision historical records of mains frequency changes from a database. In effect the mains hum signal is treated as if it were a time-dependent digital watermark that can help identify when the recording was created, detect edits in the recording, or disprove tampering of a recording.[1][2][3][4].  
  * The audio mark we leave on the world with our communal electronics usage

4. humanity of nature
  1. The word “lingít” means “human”;
  2. language as a medium of comminicatoin between animals, between plants. signaling. mushrooms through their roots

5. Continuous Creation
  1. community of communicaion continouos continuity 
  2. not as a flux of heraclitus the struggle of being 
  3. but as a radicalization of the time
  4. cratylus 
  5. the matrisociality of becoming
  6. patricide of parmenides


6. Rhythm of Becoming RHYTHM OF BECOMING
  1. In accord with Levinas’s thinking of inspiration in terms of the literalness of respiration, they are composed with the cadence of breath and attuned to the systole and diastole of the heart. 
  2. Oscillations and periodicities, sounds, rhythms, reverberations of Xennakis

7. Substition as Birth
  >>> “an image or a figure here.” Rather, the literalness of respiration is to be “in one’s skin”: The expression “in one’s skin” is not a metaphor for the in-itself; it refers to a recurrence in the dead time or the meanwhile which separates inspiration and expiration, the diastole and systole of the heart beating dully against the walls of one’s skin. The body is not only an image or figure here; it is the distinctive in-oneself of the contraction of ipseity and its breakup. This contraction is not an impossibility to forget oneself, to detach oneself from oneself, in the concern for oneself. It is a recurrence to oneself out of an irrecusable exigency of the other, a duty overflowing my being, a duty becoming a debt and an extreme passivity prior to the tranquility, still quite relative, in the inertia and materiality of things at rest” (Otherwise Than Being 109).
  8. Throughout his work, Levinas dialogue with ontology entails not only a subversion of the meaning of Being but also a further perversion of the notion of Becoming, the tradition that runs from Heraclitus's dictum Πάντα ῥεῖ (everything flows), through Spinoza's conatus essendi as striving to persevere in Being through Hegel's dialectical struggle as becoming, through  Nietzsche's Will to Power as Becoming, through Heidegger's analysis of Being as ecstatic Becoming.  In his later writings Levinas comprehends this anarchy of becoming through metonymic dialogues (using specific terminology to invoke the person who uses it in their thought -- such as "play" for Derrida) with Heraclitean thinkers such as Derrida, Deleuze, and Foucault.   Particular attention will be given to Levinas's discussion of Heraclitus and Cratylus in Totality and Infinity, and to his usage of water / river metaphorics in Otherwise than Being.
