SOL NOTES
The word “lingít” means “human”;

The humanism of the other person
requires this “fundamental historicity” (diachrony
as ancestry) and a “hearing the land speak,”

The humanism is the hearer.  But who is the speaker?  The voice of the world

The sounds and noises of nature disappoint when they are not heard
from the point of view of the utterance, 

In contrast, it is the social relation—the
irreducible kinship relation expressed by “all my relations”—the utterance itself
of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard
through an inspired eco-phenomenology


so means this: “[I]n social relations the real presence
of the other is important; but above all it means that this presence, far from signifying pure and simple coexistence with me, or expressing itself through the
romantic metaphor of ‘living presence,’ is fulfilled in the act of hearing” (148).
This is radical, and Bruns picks up on what is unique here to Levinas: It’s not that
sound is the medium of utterances; it’s that utterances become the medium of sound
itself (107). The sounds and noises of nature disappoint when they are not heard
from the point of view of the utterance, when they remain mired in the tranquility and materiality of things at rest, registered only in the medium of sound
with all its aesthetic self-sufficiency. In contrast, it is the social relation—the
irreducible kinship relation expressed by “all my relations”—the utterance itself
of ancestry and place by which the noise and sounds of nature are at last heard
through an inspired eco-phenomenology. This does

RHYTHM OF BECOMING
In accord with Levinas’s thinking of inspiration in terms of the literalness of respiration, they are composed with the
cadence of breath and attuned to the systole and diastole of the heart. 


The anarchy of BIRTH
t “an image or a figure here.” Rather, the literalness of respiration is to be “in
one’s skin”:
The expression “in one’s skin” is not a metaphor for the in-itself; it refers to
a recurrence in the dead time or the meanwhile which separates inspiration
and expiration, the diastole and systole of the heart beating dully against
the walls of one’s skin. The body is not only an image or figure here; it is
the distinctive in-oneself of the contraction of ipseity and its breakup. This
contraction is not an impossibility to forget oneself, to detach oneself from
oneself, in the concern for oneself. It is a recurrence to oneself out of an irrecusable exigency of the other, a duty overflowing my being, a duty becoming
a debt and an extreme passivity prior to the tranquility, still quite relative, in
the inertia and materiality of things at rest” (Otherwise Than Being 109).


TOWARDS NIETZCHEAN BECOMING
humanism of the other is a series of essays responding to the antihumanism of merleua ponty and heidegger
but also a struggle with nietzcheanism

the dread of thes primal elemental forces that haunts this work from 30s hitlerism the asertion of power as force.  the idea of the heidegger as a being subsumiinng ewverything.  the being of beings.  but the real problem of levinas scholars is that of the envirnoment ann so the defense of humanism has to be the artiulateable with the ecological consciousness . this theme has been explored much better by others

i.  I can come up with a quick topic for this.  

Levinas on the anarchy of becoming

Throughout his work, Levinas dialogue with ontology entails not only a subversion of the meaning of Being but also a further perversion of the notion of Becoming, the tradition that runs from Heraclitus's dictum Πάντα ῥεῖ (everything flows), through Spinoza's conatus essendi as striving to persevere in Being through Hegel's dialectical struggle as becoming, through  Nietzsche's Will to Power as Becoming, through Heidegger's analysis of Being as ecstatic Becoming.  In his later writings Levinas comprehends this anarchy of becoming through metonymic dialogues (using specific terminology to invoke the person who uses it in their thought -- such as "play" for Derrida) with Heraclitean thinkers such as Derrida, Deleuze, and Foucault.   Particular attention will be given to Levinas's discussion of Heraclitus and Cratylus in Totality and Infinity, and to his usage of water / river metaphorics in Otherwise than Being.


I would also like to work in something to Sol -- so maybe the idea of "becoming" in his essay .  
What I am working on now is Levinas and matriarchy so I could do something on the social in Levinas and the haudenosaunee matriarchy


Throughout his work, Levinas relies on a model of becoming as continuous creation.
