Great.  Thanks so much.  I will figure out travel and lodging on the way.  

Insofar as my talk goes, I am still figuring out the dimensions of it and rereading the texts.  I am not so much interested in the critique of later Heidegger but with the Heraclitean lineage that goes through him to Deleuze and other 60s Nietzshceans, so I will be using a lot from Otherwise than Being.  I would also like to bring in some of Sol's paper in which he attempts to look for an eco phenomenological reading of Levinas.  This is one of the great questions in Levinas -- how does he articulate the relation to the other beings of the natural world, and conversely to technology.  I have some clues about this but I am not sure.  I really like Sol's interpretation of diachrony as ancestry through history. My own research has been about motherhood so it would be great if I could somehow fit in something about the Haudensoaunee society as an exemplar of a Levinasian matri-social. https://ictnews.org/archive/power-haudenosaunee-women

i.  I can come up with a quick topic for this.  

Levinas on the anarchy of becoming

Throughout his work, Levinas dialogue with ontology entails not only a subversion of the meaning of Being but also a further perversion of the notion of Becoming, the tradition that runs from Heraclitus's dictum Πάντα ῥεῖ (everything flows), through Spinoza's conatus essendi as striving to persevere in Being through Hegel's dialectical struggle as becoming, through  Nietzsche's Will to Power as Becoming, through Heidegger's analysis of Being as ecstatic Becoming.  In his later writings Levinas comprehends this anarchy of becoming through metonymic dialogues (using specific terminology to invoke the person who uses it in their thought -- such as "play" for Derrida) with Heraclitean thinkers such as Derrida, Deleuze, and Foucault.   Particular attention will be given to Levinas's discussion of Heraclitus and Cratylus in Totality and Infinity, and to his usage of water / river metaphorics in Otherwise than Being.


I would also like to work in something to Sol -- so maybe the idea of "becoming" in his essay .  
What I am working on now is Levinas and matriarchy so I could do something on the social in Levinas and the haudenosaunee matriarchy


Throughout his work, Levinas relies on a model of becoming as continuous creation.
