occupy for a significant amount of time

city owned property 
bank owned property foreclosed on  

clear path for the owner to turn it over

handing property over to a group assumes that the group will have the same goals 

that kind of work has to happen during that time

community land trust city owned buildings crumbling partially occupied 
sounded great that we would occupy the community can be land trust

not everyone wanted that .  other people wanted 

it just takes time

can be figured out during an occupation 

for property to be turned to over to center 

put peoples needs in the center
