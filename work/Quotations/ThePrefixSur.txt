Bataille
Nietzsche Sur as revalation of values

An entire philosophy, neglected only for pragmatic reasons, has as
its aim the establishing of values that would permit individuals to raise them-
selves above human class conditions. 

n for an individual of the bourgeois class derives from
eventual action of an Icarian complex. It is impossible to betray one's class
through friendship for the proletariat, but only through an inclination to seize
what one must call, in accordance with Nietzsche's terminology, "fire from
heaven,": and this is to be accomplished by simple subversion, for the pleasure
of infringing supposedly intangible laws. But individuals only want to seize fire
from heaven in order to annihilate themselves, like mites in the presence of an
acetylene torch

Therefore it was necessary not only
to create new values, but more precisely values able to fill the void left by God:
hence a series of antireligious and ethereal values.


The same double tendency is found in contemporary surrealism, which main-
tains, of course, the predominance of higher ethereal values (clearly expressed
by the addition of the prefix sur, the trap into which Nietzsche had already fallen
with superman). More precisely, since surrealism is immediately distinguishable
by the addition of low values (the unconscious, sexuality, filthy language, etc.),
it invests these values with an elevated character by associating them with the
most immaterial values.
