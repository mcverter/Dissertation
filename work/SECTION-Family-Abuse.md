* Past leadership included many white cisgender men that didn’t fully understand how deeply mental health struggles are interlocked with many forms of oppression. The result was an oppressive organizational culture that harmed people of color, women and femmes, LGBTQIA+ and other marginalized folks. White cis men, particularly those affiliated with The Icarus Project’s New York City chapter, were the folks most often named in these grievances, that also included unwanted sexual advances and systematic abuse of power. We attempted to develop internal accountability processes, however, white folks that sat firmly by people accused of causing harm disrupted and derailed the process and the women, femmes, and/or people of color spearheading these efforts experienced intense backlash and retaliation. It became clear that in order to stop and heal these harms, we had to transition away from white cis men leadership. The first step was to end the relationship with local groups as we were not able to guarantee the safety of these spaces.
