# Chapter Eight: Anarchism as a Practice of Care

This argues against a boring macho version of anarchism, as advocated by insurrectionists and the Tikkun group in particular.  It contrasts this with a Levinasian/Kropotkin/feminist reading of mutual aid as ethic motherhood

I would like to supplement my previous article with contemporary discussions of how care informs contemporary revolutionary praxis.  I know a little bit from bell hooks, but there is an entire literature of Black Feminist thought that I do not know.  Ask Deva Woodly about this, also read “Revolutionary Mothering” and other Alexis Gumbs tests.  Also Leah Lakshmi Singh.  Some stuff from crip and indigenous writers – maybe from indigenous doulas?
