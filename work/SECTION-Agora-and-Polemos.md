             i) Hartsock “Barracks Myth  Hartsock, N. (1982) ‘The barracks community in western political thought: prolegomena to a feminist critique of war and politics’, Women’s Studies International Forum, 5:3/4.
                 (1) ”Before we consider the importance of the feminist critique, let us begin by asking what are the aims and aspirations of anarchism. Anarchism is sometimes defined simply as the refusal of the state. However, anarchism must strive towards a much more profound goal than this. The long history of authoritarian domination has penetrated our ways of thinking and acting so deeply that an anarchist critique must re-evaluate the very roots of political philosophy, of the thinking that considers communality in terms of political association. The feminist scholar Nancy Hartsock argues that Western political thinking has been shaped by the way that the Greek polis (city-state) emerged out of what she terms the ‘barracks community’ (Hartsock, 1982, p. 283). Within this military encampment, the paradigmatic virtues were defined as courage, heroism, glory and the striving for immortality; human relationships were conceived as being fundamentally antagonistic and competitive, as struggles for power and domination. Hartsock claims that war and the masculine role of the warrior-hero have been central to our conception of politics ever since: for example, the warrior’s dominance on the physical battlefield has been transformed into the citizen’s dominance on the battlefield of rhetoric and into the businessman’s dominance on the field of commerce (Hartsock, 1982, pp. 285–6).
             ii) Heraclitus/Heidegger/POLEMOS as originary opening of being or whatever nonsense
                 (1) I wrote about this for Simon.  Do I still have the paper?
             iii) Thought as constituted as an agora, a field of struggle to be right as a macho paradigm

             iv) We will encounter our disagreements with others in different manner than critique
                 (1) For example above we recognized a question and held it open without answering it
                 (2) Unanswerability (Levinas) .  not exactly “unanswerable” but more it’s always an infinite conversation without terminus or conclusion.
                 (3) Maybe explore the idea of “responsibility” as “responding” to someone else in a conversation, and what it means when one is unable to respond
                 (4) also Buddhist notions of remaining within the problem rather than trying to answer it.
