*         d) Levinas, Perverter  (A very weird paper.  Lots of wacky stuff.  Look in here for Heraclitus, perspectivism, critique of Simon Critchley) 
*             i) Since the inauguration of modern French feminism in Simone DeBeauvoir’s The Second Sex, Emmanuel Levinas has been criticized for the way his thought employs gendered, familial tropes.  In response, this paper argues that, although this does constitute a very real and urgent problematic in Levinas’s thought, it only becomes a problem when his writing is read in a hermeneutically "straight" manner.  Beneath the apparent hetero-normative veneer of Levinas's prose lurk traces of queerness.  By closely tracing the motifs that Levinas correlates with gender, this paper will illustrate how, at each instant in the ethical relationship, the Self is always transforming between masculine- and feminine-gendered performances for a feminine- or masculine-gendered Other.  Rather than embodying a conservative and essentialist view of sexuality, Levinas articulates an existential performative perversity.

*     21) https://www.waste.org/~roadrunner/writing/Levinas/AnarchismOtherPerson_WEB.htm
*             i) Throughout his writing, the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas uses the term anarchy to critique different modes of temporal, thematic, and political ordering. After an exploration of the Greek meanings of anarcian, this paper discusses the way that Levinas uses anarchy to point towards an ethical responsibility that arises before the political time of history.  This interruption of time also disrupts the self's ownership of personal private property.  The political ramifications of Levinas' distinction between autarchy, the selfish assertion of absolute ownership, and anarchy is illuminated by comparison with the works of various anarchists.  Lastly, Levinas' development of the notion of anarchy is historically situated among the actual anarchist events unfolding around him.
