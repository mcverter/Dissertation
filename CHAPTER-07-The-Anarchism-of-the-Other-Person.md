# Chapter Seven: The Anarchism of the Other Person

In this article, I distinguish between “autarchy” and “anarchy.”  I claim, perhaps wrongly, that the first active usage of the term occurs in the descriptions of Antigone and her lawless defiance of Creon (literally “ruler” in Greek) to perform an ethical deed for an ethical (familiar) brother, even after his death.  I am not sure how much of this needs to be modified.  I can certainly explore the idea of “arche” further and explore the notions of “nationalism” and perhaps even a critique of academia as an institution of illusory credentialization, maybe also an exploration of the “indigenous”.  Dunno.
