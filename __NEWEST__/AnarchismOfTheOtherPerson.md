Over the years, I have written many texts that outline an "Anarchism of the Other Person", an anarchafeminism read through the writings of Emmanuel Levinas and Petr Kropotkin. This task has long seemed urgent to me because it contrasts (but perhaps also complements) with contemporary anarchist writings informed by Nietzsche, Deleuze, Nietzschean, Stirner, Heidegger, etc. That is, anarchism is compelled by our continuous ethical orientation to other persons (even the other person who I am to myself over time), not by a Heraclitean flux of interpenetrating forces.

In this work I will explore several avenue to check upon the possibilities for discussing the work of Emmaneul Levinas as a philosopher of anarchism of the other person.

We will begin with a discussion of what is constituted by ethics for levinas.

A) What is ethics for Levinas?
Theories of Ethics are divided into a lot of different terms. For example, "normative" and "perscriptive" or "descriptive". Levinas as none of these but as a way in which our everyday lvies are shaped.

In order to understand this we must understand the sources of Levinas's project. From Husserl the understanding of the world as relating back to the subject's perception of the world. First Heidegger when he defines fundmanetal ontology as the way that one is not a passive member of the past or the passive present but takes on the heritage of the past as one's own (eigenlichtkeit) and understanding how the people are bound together that the existence of human being is fundamental to our being, that our existence is bound together with being at large.

Fundamental questions of temporality: in what way am I the same person over time? In what way does time connect unto itself? Locke quotation from the essays -- also Dmitri's paper let's hope. Time consciousnes sand how the each moment leads into the other.

The question of the Being of Becoming -- how do moments flow from one to the other? Is there an eternal substance beneath all everything and things that change are merely accidents of this time, a fourth dimenstional spacetime continuum a fourth dimensional prism? Is time like Becoming, like a river in Heraclitus. Our foundational ideas about Becoming of time. Everything flows. Everything is in flux. Panta Rhei. Levinas contrasts his idea of time from between the Cratylus and the Heraclitus, where one can not even place ones foot in the same river once?

What is it for Levinas htat is so disruptive of time and time consciousness, of our self identity , of existence itself that is so disruptive to temporality of becoming is our relationships with other people.

It is this "curvature of spacetime", the perspective in which one is related to other people, that is what Levinas means by ethics.

Ethics is a phenomenological and ontological term for Levinas

## Anarchy

What then does this have to do with anarchy?

That things have no stable foundation. That nothig is permanent or abiding or absolute. The Absolute state is a sham as is the Absolute Deity. Domination comes from this belief in absolutes.

To solve this problem of the abosoluteness of everything anarchists ahve recommended an approach instead of ontological anarchy. Realizign that everything is in flux and always changing. Max Cafard says. pull a quote here.

But is this the only way that things break up? That they are always subject to chaos? And if so it is chaos? What is the disrupting element, the swerve (clinamen) that affects the movement of particules to give time a sense of randomness? The warping of gravity is that which is affected by the other.

The modes of our world that in which we exist, that form the intermediary realm in and through which we wander, are shaped and warped and contorted and subverted, perverted, inverted, and reverted perspectives by the gravity of the other person within the spacetime continuum The discontinuity of one's own existence as the "I is an other" of Rimbaud always transforming. But also the structure of time, in that we inherit a whole bunch of stuff from other people through time. And also the structure of society, that at any tiem we relate to other people we ultimatley are in static set of social relations.

Social relations are an important thing for Marxism and HEegeliansm . But how is Leivnas different? These social relation in many readings of Marx and Hegel would take theis to form what levinas calls a totality, a whole picture in which everything that can be captured by a snapshot that can be mapped out as a set of inner relations of the parts that constitute the whole. For Levinas a continual refusal to attempt that type of summary and encapsulation, to catpure the entrelyt in a lateral view. The other person comes at you in a certain orientation a veriety one is always standing in relation to others. For this reason the always disrupts this ttality . The total picture is just a snapshot that obscures the dynamic within the picture itself. THat these things are always broken apart and in fact never were a single thing to begin with.

In this way, Levinas carries on with an idea that is in Hegel of separating moments of time into constitutents. A descriptive phenomonlogy of each moment of time. That each is disrupted by the other even before it can acheive self existence and that illustrating the inner structure of this relationship to singularity of the other person, the fact that the other person is an irreplaceableity of an individual and not merely an example of a certain type of person, and that within this dimesnion of our relationship with individuals is already the relatiosnhip with other persons -- that you have a smile on your face when i see you in the morning because the bodega clerk made coffee this morning.

That our everyday existence is already informed by our relationships with other persons is fundamentatl to understanding the fundamentally anarchistic mode of our everyday existence. that we are already responsible to the other person and that the other person can surprise us with an unanticipated response. We never have everything at our control. At best we are projecting or inspecting or we ahve a certain snapshot, a certain idea of a person but that person inhabits it with their own particular gravity. That person is a woman but she occupies that place of her womanhood in her own particular manner -- she dresses in her own particular way, different levels of emotional and mental and spirtiual engagement, relationship with her own bodilty capablities like that of becoming a mother and so on. And beyond this they are a past that we can never fully know and a future that surprises us. that even if we can predict the ultimate outcome in a perfect skinner box of determinism, that the way that the other person reaches that terminus, the path is unpredictable to us.

The problem of the pataphysical. The study of exceptions. In that every person throught erheir exisence is already an exception to the general rule, a new data point that must be incorporated to make the metric. Every other is an excpetion too

not "interconnected" by the intermediary sphere. we are connected through by linksages and within a globe. how do we analysie those? What is a medium? Medium is separation how are we linked and separated. It is this which is analszble. But we are nodes aupon this and looked more closely everything is a node

We are therfore resopnsible. In the sense that we are always responding to a relationship to other persons. Even our relationshpi to ourself is with another perosn. We are always in a reaction. the possiblity of our awareness is the possiblity of being affected by another person, in a way a passivility that already infomrs our every move. We are pulled by this gravity of the other person, it inclines us towards it, Like the Einstein used the example of gravity warping spacetime: place a ball in the middle of a sheet and the fabric around the ball bends in its direction. We are alrady inclined in their direction and in this sense already obligated towards them.

This obligation is not a domination but a freedom. The characteristic view of authoritarian thought is that other people threaten our own existenc. That what informs our relatinships with other people are along the axis of power -- or of Desire, which Baudrillard points out is a synonym for power (Baudrillard). Or that Hannah Arendt figues that is our relationship with the body. That it is a domantion of our freedom. That we must escapte th yoke of others to realizce our freedom. Sartre Hell is Other People that would find the existence of each of the three persons of Huis Clos the implinging of one on the other.

But maybe instead the obligations towards other people are our sources of freedom as well. They are what allow us to do anything really. Why get up but to see a freind to have a chat, to watch a tv show with people in it, to eat oatmeal that other people have farmed that other people have grown that other people have boxed that other people. Even if one were to declare oneself a hermit and to go into nature by oneself, one has no pathway to nature but through other people, even if only physically by following their maps and their roads.

## Economy and Ecology

Levinas approaches Becoming in a weird way. He starts from Hebrew scripture as the mythopoetic that is perhaps problematic as many feminist scholars have objected. Problematic from Foucault and Canguielm as the core motivating thing that is driving the entire discussion. However, this is not only problematic for Levinas, but it is his problematic. As Derrida says "perhaps the question s that we are asking levinas are the ones he is asking to us"

This quesitoning will take the form of raising the mythopoesis of the Hebraic scripture, a history of patriarchs and matriarchs.

Being and becoming occurs not as a flux of anonymous forces, of panta rhei, of all things arising from polemos, the conflict of opposites. But instead as the generation of gendered generations, of relationships constituted as relatives, of kinspersons and foreigners.

Thus Levinas explores through a series of analytic structures that have been questioned: family members (mothers, fathers, daughters, orphans, widows, sisters, an infertile woman -- this is the witches in macbeth, son of life), as well as a deeply ambiguous employment of gender binaries.

Problematic gender binaries maybe. Talk about sociobiology to get a better understanding of what it might mean for how gender relationships have informed the generation of generations throughout evolutionary history and within primates, within the development of human socieities

### The feminine

Levinas defines the rlationship that one has with the other as "welcoming" . A few pages before he explains that the woman's role is the welcoming.

### Home

Oikos for Levinas is the thing that is important here.
Homeplace from bell hooks that illustrates the importance of home in situatign oneself in a way that fees safe and comforatble within oneself. Levinas talks about the "home" that is made.

Aristotle understands the home as a site of domination.

What is a home though? A home is a place where one meets one's needs

Hannah Arendt understand needs as fundamentatl to domination.

But alongside this idea of "meal tub fellows". This is the root of our word "companion", that "we work, we eat together" of the Diggers.

How do we address our needs together in a way that is respectful to all. What are needs
Kropotkin -- that we can meet our needs in the first place is the remarkable thing and that shows our fundamental indebtedness to one another. A debt that leads to our obligation to one another. THat we are bound together in solidarity.

Solidarity is thus not just a thing that we should strive for but something that already exists. We are already bound to other people. We just need to recognize this indebtedness and to make it manifest. Here I say "indebtedness" rathat than "interconnectedness" because of lateral view. Not something that can be overlayed with by a graph and that we can calculate the most efficiet way to do it. Well actually no it is. Logistics is the way we do it. But also we expereince it as a personal realtionship. Not just that "debt exists in the marketplace" but that I myself am in debt to somebody else and need to pay
