In this song, Awilo raises the problematic of "garbage". This is exactly the problematic of the colonial. This is one of the reasons why black people are murdered by the cops, because they are considered "garbage", because white cops feel the need to clean up the mess that black people represent by shooting and choking them.
"Laisse les ordures dans la poubelle" =
